Serious smiles a lot 
At least that’s what they say
His Mum and Pop
Trying to be proud
As all the nurses gather round
To squint into the cloud
Of little Serious on the ultrasound It’s likely just the way he’s bent
The head nurse finally thunders
Into the awe and argument
Swirling through the crowd
Where someone mutters half-aloudIn all my years…
 
Serious never hears 
Serious spins and spins
With his dumb dolphin grin
In the best bed there is
Where there’s no guilt and no sin
No child more inner than this
Nothing to will
And nothing to want
No body you both are and haunt
No drug of disappointment
Or feeling that there’s never now
Or do these seep in somehow
No suffering the world’s idiocy
 
Like a saint its pains
No traffic and no planes
No debts no taxes
No phones and no faxes
No rockslide of information
Called the Internet 
 
Serious isn’t  Yet 
 
 
2 
Serious hears a sound 
Not unusual in itself nothing to be concerned about 
Here and there there’s been a shout
A song he seemed to be inside
The weird whale-calls of her gas 
This too shall pass 
 
Then it comes again
And with a far-off force
Which a shrink less serious than he
Will have him dream is a drain
That all his impurity
Is slowly drifting towardDown Serious says down 
Beyond which he’ll be clean
Feel no pain…
 
Then the dark erupts in a rain
Of blood and muck
He seems to mostly be
Holding on for all he’s worth
Which isn’t much finally
Little wizened thing
Plopping out to an earth
Where cries of agony
Dwindle to equivocal joyIt’s it’s…is it a boy 
And some clear world lies
Just beyond the eyes
You can’t quite open
 
And everything is wet
And loud and broken
And all of life is one huge tit
You’re meant to somehow suck 
 
Serious staggers to his feet
Slaps himself harder than the doctor did
And says I’m fucked 
 
 
3 
Serious is learning silence
In the way most children learn to speak Poshlust
He gasps after his first feedingGötterdämmerung in his first dusk
His whole body writhing with a kind of violence
As if the world had wounded him
Words his bleeding 
 Anomie Deus absconditus
Drift into the air above his cribAccursed progenitor quintessence of dust
Dribble with the pap onto his bib
As day by day and week by week
Serious wrestles with this difficult gift
Forgetting which it seems he is on this earth to do 
 Boob ass oaf
Riving out of him like greatness going offNinny crackpate clunkhead gorm
Leaving him gasping and bentfragments sheep rabble
All falling falling from him
Backwards into babble   
 
Finally Serious lies there spent
Language like some immense ghostly mobile
Bobbing just above his bed
All power of movement gone as well
 
Useless little buglike arms buglike little fingers
This heavy heavy head 
 
And now if there’s something Serious can’t quite taste
Or if he feels too acutely his own waste
Or knows too acutely what he can’t tell
He screams and screams
Until the world knows what Serious means 
 
 
4 
Serious goes to school Just try it his Mum says
As she lets go his hand
And wipes a last glaze
Of doughnut from his nose
And Serious insofar as Serious can
Does give it a good try
Though it’s hard to understand
Why they keep taking a break
From taking breaks or why
They can’t simply walk
In line down the hall
Or what finally is at stake
In a game of kickball 
 
It’s time to draw a tree 
What a relief to work alone
Serious thinks as he picks a scab
For just the right tinge of sky
Breaks his sugar cookie
To make a place of stone
And fashions out of bread
A man with a huge head
And huge ruined wings
Gasping at all the ruined things
To which he’s tumbled 
And calls it Cookie Crumbled 
 Oh my the teacher says
When she walks byThose are interesting trees  
Serious closes his eyes and sees
As in a vision of doom
Himself drowning in schools
A whole ocean of fools
Nipping nipping at him
With their tiny tiny teeth 
And Serious sighs
With a prophet’s wisdom
As he climbs up into his seat
Stares out across the room
And like a prophet criesYou’re all going to die
 
The class is a tomb 
Serious rigid waits 
A girl in pigtails giggles
Then another near the back 
And as if along a fuse
The giggling goes
Up and down the rows
Till someone makes a crack
About his coat and tie
And the laughter detonates 
 
Serious climbs slowly down
Into that inferno of sound
Which the teacher’s shouts
Are only driving higher
Packs up his lunchbox his dignity
And his copy of Sartre
 
And strides with a prophet’s gaze
Through all that derisive fire 
Only once does he turn
Briefly to look back through the blaze
At the iron fact of his art
Smaller from here but unburned 
 
 
5 
Serious loves his Mum 
And then he doesn’t quite 
It’s that way with everything 
Baths and plums
The blessèd silence of night 
 Would you like to help with this
His mother asks
As she rolls out biscuit dough
And cuts it with a glass
Or folds the clothes
Still warm from the sun 
But Serious knows
He was born with a task
And though he touches the clothes
And tastes the dough
Serious says No 
 
Serious stays in the bath
Until his skin is shriveled and cold
Eats himself sick on plums
Feels in the dark
The dark he becomes
And cries out in the night for his Mum 
 
 
6 
Serious is older now 
He just is Thank God Serious says
For whom childhood that stupid carousel that never stops
Always had an element of disingenuousness
The tristesse of lollipops
The sham of naps
Fools dandling you on their laps
So you can play horsey which damn sure isn’t serious
And all that endless business
Of pretending to be curious
About the most obvious things
What’s night Where’s Mama-Cat
What’s wrong with Pop Can God die
Why why why
 
To hell with that
Serious thinks as he sits incinerating memories
One by one
Saying their names as he feeds them
Like photographs to a fire
Here he is in a baseball uniform
Squinting back the sun
Here in a blue tuxedo with a ruffled front
And here Lord with pimples 
He pauses a moment 
Do memories have names
And what exactly are these flames
To hell with that
Done 
 
Serious owns a car pays taxes
Contemplates a pension
Has a crease of gray along his temples
But he is young young 
He develops headaches begins sleeping badly and relaxes
You might say into the constant tension
That he really always was
With far far too much to do
To look anywhere but onward
Or to answer the questions of a child
With anything true 
 
 
7 
Serious isn’t Stupid
Though they go to the same gym 
Serious sees him dropping weights
Or picking his butt and thinks
At least I’m not him 
Nor is he Mean or Vain
Those chiseled twins
With matching boots and belts
Nor Smug who notes their sins
Nor Shallow noting something else
He isn’t useless Timid
Who no matter what won’t complain
Nor fat-assed Nice sweating honey
On all the machines
Nor Self-Loathing who smudges mirrors
Nor Whacked who licks them clean 
Serious isn’t Funny 
 
Serious spreads his towel on the bench
Sits down in front of his own image
And Serious strains at a serious weight 
And never not once when he’s seen
In myriad mirrors around the room
That everyone else is straining too
Has he caught himself too late
And finished with a roar
And more strength
Than he’s ever had beforeI AM NOT YOU
 
 
8 
Serious has a date with Doom 
It’s not the first and seems unlikely to be the last
For they get on quite well Doom and he
Share similar pasts
And similar ideas about what life should be 
It seems in fact that this might just bloom 
 
And what a relief 
After Morose and Mad and Neurotic
After almost falling for Grief
Who was so exotic
She made all the others seem tame 
Then to discover she even lied about her name 
And to sleep with another Serious That was odd
Like wrestling with an angel
Though it was hard to tell from that rough unsated tangle
Which one was Serious and which one God 
 
But how easy it is to be himself with Doom
Serious thinks as he puts the wine in to chill
And sets two glasses on a tray
Who always wants whatever Serious wants
And always agrees with what he has to say
Who doesn’t need to hear that whole spiel
About “going too fast” or “needing more room”
And who doesn’t probe and pry that long needle into his brain
 What do you feel What do you feel 
Until it’s all Serious can do not to stand up and scream Pain
 
Lucky to be alive 
And if he still has no clear idea where she lives
And never knows quite when she’ll arrive
Still something about Doom feels right
To Serious and he looks forward to their dates 
He checks himself in the mirror dims the light
And waits 
 
 
9 
Serious is a traveler 
“Traveling broadens the mind”
The man beside him says
His tray table down and seat reclined
Even as theyre taking off
And Serious who has his eyes closed
So he can do what Serious does
Begins to cough 
 
               What do they say what do they fear 
               Is this song joy or grief 
               This is a man this is a god  
               Who are you and why are you here 
               To leave to leave 
 
The meal is over
Which Serious declined 
In the shell-roar of the cabin
He eases somewhat is surprised to find
He could almost drift away 
“What line of work are you in”
He hears the man beside him say
And Serious begins coughing wildly again 
 
               What is that smell what was that sound 
               Isn’t that ice on the wings 
               This is the air there is the water 
               But what do you do on the way down 
               You scream you scream 
 
How far they must have gone by now
That old familiar world miles behind
The man eats an orange
And now he eats the rind 
He eats his plate his plastic fork chews
With animal relish his Styrofoam cup
Leans over to eat bittersweet Serious too
Who startles and wakes up 
 
               Look at the desert look at the green 
               Is there an end to that ice 
               Here is a place and here is a place 
               But what is the space between 
               It’s life it’s life 
 
 
10 
Serious is married 
What a weird wind this is
He thinks so still at times
Then stinging the eyes to tears 
And how he seems both more and less
Himself and how it seems at once all of loneliness
And something he can hold 
Or is it he whos being carried
He shivers and reaches out for her again 
Or is it she who reaches she whos cold
What is this wind
Where are these years
 
 
11 
Serious experiences loss 
Just like that 
Flat 
Serious experiences loss
 
As if he’d come to some sheer cliff
There was no way around
No way to cross
And found
On the other side
Of a deep canyon himself
Experiencing loss 
 
Serious when the man is gone
Tells himself that he tried
Tells himself that he cried and cried
For all he was worth
To the man sitting on the other side
Experiencing loss
Who one day simply vanished or moved on
Or slipped off the edge of the earth
And died 
 
 
12 
Serious doesn’t speak French 
This embarrasses Serious
Because insofar as he lives anywhere
Serious lives in Paris 
 
He feels the city stare
Feels himself sweat and shake as he tries to wrench
The little that he’s gleaned
Into the lot that he desires
Feels shopkeepers look at him as if he were a liar
Waiters as if he were unclean
 
And feels in truth not at all serious
As if he had a huge balloon for a head
And helium squeaks for a voice
As if gravity could be merely a choice
He were making and he might instead
Simply stop let go and drift away 
 
Finally Serious opposed to epiphanies
Has one he can’t resist 
He is Serious and to be Serious
Is to know something utterly or not at all
And to know moreover
That as you let your half-knowledge fall
From you it does not exist 
 
Just like that Serious is himself again
Saying weighty things
About the flowers in the stalls
Pondering a splendid mirage
Called the Seine 
 
And if he wakes saying fromage
Or in some shop feels
Right on the verge of translating please
Serious knows it’s a dream
And knows from childhood what to do 
Point and scream
Until the damn fools give you cheese 
 
 
13 
Serious has some culture 
He knows some things 
And if as he begins to speak
He should feel the immense wings
Of ignorance shadowing him that dirty vulture
That squawks in drawl and drips tobacco juice
Serious knows what shelter to seek 
 
Pick a name and Bach is better 
Modernism was powerful but diffuse 
Life’s drained out of pictures since the Renaissance 
Technique Technique Technique
And about all that spastic flatulence
Called contemporary art
Well Serious hardly knows where to start 
 
Serious sits through opera without a yawn
Chews up books on which weaker teeth would shatter
He can tell you where one brushstroke lies
List the reasons courtly love is gone
Pluck the speck of subject matter
From Henry James 
Serious knows some things 
 
He thinks and thinks and thinks
Until his ignorance shrinks
To the tiniest of flies
Alighting somewhere in the Louvre 
Carefully carefully Serious creeps
With his massive swatter
Saying Don’t move  Don’t move 
 
 
14 
Serious believes in nothing 
It’s a nice day what should we do
What are you thinking
What’s been bothering you
What’s that you’re drinking
 
Serious spreads the paper on his lap
To confirm what’s new under the sun
Hears a tap tap tap 
Against the windowpane 
 Nothing ventured nothing gained
Floats up from childhood like a bit of ash
And Serious pausing can almost see
His old preacher that atom bomb of idiocy
Who every Sunday would explode 
Still Serious thinks there’s a truth to set you free 
But who could survive the blast
 Tap tap tap 
 
Serious skims the sports pages
Reads about a storm that rages
Far out at sea 
Some talking dog is taking office
Some country wiping out monuments expunging its past 
 Tap tap tap 
 Goddammit Serious says midway through a war
And thinks again of that old bore
Who talked and talked and talked
Until you felt your head loll and sway
Like some huge flower on a tiny stalk
That one good breeze would break
 
And how you’d see him afterwards eating chicken fried steak
Chicken fried man
With a tiny transistor radio in his hand
So he could listen to the football game
And how his face seethed and writhed with what seemed pain
If he saw you coming to his booth
And he stared off as if some great truth
Were finally finally coming clear in that chicken fried brain
And like a prophet he was going to stand up and shout 
Until what plopped innocuously out
Was your own name 
 Tap tap tap 
 
Serious puts aside the news of the day
And walks to the only window there is 
But there’s no wind not even the grass stirs 
And anyway there’s no tree 
Serious shrugs and turns away 
Must just be me 
 
 
13 
Serious sees a child
In the playground across the street
Sees his huge stupid head and huge stupid feet
As he tries to keep up with the games
And hears his sonar screams
Of delight amid the other childrens screams
And hears his timid weeping when they call him names 
 
Serious sees the child standing apart sometimes
Driveling to himself in silly rhymes
And sees him pretend to look intently at the sky
If Serious walks by
Or sees him simply stop and stare 
 
Gradually Serious starts seeing the child everywhere
In a store standing in an aisle
In the subway while
Serious is trying to work on the way home
Or laughing with his family in a restaurant
Where Serious eats alone 
 
Serious knows the truth 
This child wants something his whole nature is want 
And it begins to be annoying
This novice cringing all the imbecilic and cloying
Tactics of being cute
The whole hangdog way he has of panhandling pity
With his freckles and his missing tooth
Sitting all fidgety in his Sunday suit
Or babbling happily as he’s leaking snot
 
And then the air he suddenly puts on of being serious
When it’s so obvious he’s not 
 
Serious sees the child in the playground
Standing to the side
Sees his face whiten and his eyes go wide
As Serious crosses the street and strides
Until his shadow swallows the child
And leans down close enough for them to kiss I don’t have time for this
Serious saysI’ve got too much to do 
 
And the child says Who are you
 
 
16 
Serious kills himself No no
Shivering out of a dream
Starlight and the hard glitter
Under the bridge’s beam
Serious Serious
Don’t go 
 
Serious crawls out of bed
Feels the cold in the floor
And thinks suddenly of lovely Mad
Where can she be
Who’d bolt out of sleep and screamFarmers get up at four
It’s three 
 
Serious makes himself a cup of coffee
Which he doesn’t drink
Tries and fails to read
Tries and fails to think 
Serious sits and holds himself still
Minute by minute
Until the dawn finally comes
And he is in it 
 
 
17 
Serious lives alone 
It’s better this way he tells himself
As he takes a pan from the pan shelf
A spatula from the spatula drawer
And fries two eggs the way he likes them
Yolks of stone 
 
No more gnats of chatter over breakfast 
No more breakfast  It’s noon 
No one prancing by with only panties on
When he’s almost almost broken through
Or singsonging outside his doorSerious O Serious where are you
No more
 
But what finally does Serious do
He sits ignores the ringing phone
Looks at a wall
On one of the last warm days of the year
And settles back into the lifelong call
Of being serious
Which is to see within that whiteness
Leaves being gently blown
And to feel their colors as they fall 
 
 
18 
Serious gives a speech 
He sets his papers on the podium
His glass within easy reachTap tap taps the microphone 
How vast this venue is 
How absolute this darkness 
 To be serious is to be alone
Serious cries out with a triumphant look on his face
Waiting for the echoes to end
Out there in all that space
Which the words at once define and extend 
It takes a while but they do die 
The spotlight lasers in 
He blinks hard starts again 
 To know in every hand another’s touch To hear a silence words only intensify To feel not too little but too much This attenuated world 
 
Serious begins to sweat
Feels the back of his shirt grow wet
Looks down to see his papers swirled
And scattered the glass on the floor broken 
What’s with this fucking light he thinks
Or was it spoken
He glares out at the dark impassive crowd
And as if by force he could make them wake
Hears his voice growing loud
 Whatever you most treasure you will break Whatever you hold closest you will let go There is no place that you will not leave But to be serious 
                                  Serious says
Quietly now because he has them they are his 
 To be serious to be truly serious is to know That what you call your losses you cannot grieve For it was never quite these things that you wanted This treasure this touch this one place But by such life to be haunted 
 
Brilliant
No notes no flaws 
Serious stands back and waits for applause 
The hall is silent utterly silent
The heat tropic 
 
Serious looks around confused
Turns to the man who introduced him
Then can’t remember being introduced
And even given his credentials
This suddenly seems a most unlikely topic 
 
Serious tries to get out of the light
But the light goes where Serious goes 
He blunders to the edge of the stage
A cliff
Breaking off into a dark
in which theres no movement no voices not one sigh 
 
Serious feels the rage
Draining out of him and feels a chill and whispersWhere am I
 
 
19 
Serious nears an end 
It’s cold and getting colder
And Serious older
Sits outside thinking of his good friend
Who like so much of Serious is gone
And thinking of that godforsaken dawn
After the one night of his life he spent outdoors 
 Tell me
His good friend said
When Serious staggered out to the fireWhich form would you say is higherTragedy or comedy
 
And Serious who had stumbled full-bladdered
In the night from a dream of bears
Then dreamed himself the object
Of a dozen hungry stares
Who had swiveled pissed into the tent
And sworn such things it would take a life to repent
Serious exhausted Serious
Was silent 
 Because it’s been troubling meSerious that the answer can only be tragedy To be conscious is to be conscious ofLosing whatever it is that you most loveAnd thus an art thats truly greatWill always have one deepest truth to tellWhich is my friend this life is hell 
 
Serious looks at the sky  It’s late 
A small wind blows
The trees and Serious shivering knows
He should head inside
That he is not well 
But sitting here letting his eyes close
Serious can almost see that lake
Aflame with the early sun and smell
The sweet burn of that wood
And feel the way it seemed his heart would surely break
Were it not for the strange lightness in his head
As his friend smiled and saidBut maybe earth is the heaven of the good 
 
 
20 
Serious talks to God 
There’s no one else left 
His mind is mash
His world is ash
And Serious occasionally forgets himself
Though he is not not Bereft
That sniveling idiot two doors down
Who sits up late
With only ashes in the grate
And talks to God 
 See Serious says  SeeNothing 
Serious spreads his arms magnanimously
As if to give God the floor 
God declines Thou know’st the first time that we smell the airWe wawl and cry
Serious says louder than before And then we wawl and cry some moreAnd then we dieAnd then we rot
Again he waits in case
There’s disagreement  There’s not 
 
Serious scoffs goes to brush his teeth
Forgets briefly to avert his eye
From the mirror’s glare
And finds his father there
 
That gentle baffled man
Who when there was no hope
When he couldn’t even stand
Carved from a piece of soap
A silly yellow duck
And set it in a little yellow dish 
Serious feels a tingling in his hair
And mutters something close to a prayerI wish I wish   
 
The lights go out Goddammit Serious shouts
As he trips and falls
To his knees on the floor
Banging his head on the door
As he tries to rise GodDAMMIT Serious cries 
 
The lights come on 
His father’s gone
But there at the edge of the sink
Balances the little duck in the little dish
No serious person would ever keep 
Serious tries to think
Steadies himself as if at some brink
Decides he needs sleep
That’s what he needs
Crawling fully clothed into his bed
And pulling the covers to his chin
Because it seems there’s some strange wind
 
That’s somehow gotten inside 
So unlike Serious
To leave a door unclosed 
 
Yet here it is gathering strength
As it blows his books
On the floor and it blows
Right through his body and it blows
Behind and below and above
And out of the whirlwind a voice cries
 
                    Love
 What Serious says as he tries
To sit upright and looks
Wildly around him
Raising his fist in the air The things   I have lost 
 
Immediately he is tossed
Back against the wall
By the force of a storm
That has no source no form
And hears again the call
Out of nowhere
 
                    Love
 My God Serious screams
Unable to help himselfWhat maundering politicianWhat decerebrated pop star What stupid puling poet Couldn’t tell me that 
Struggling to get out of bed
He starts to cough then choke
A riot in his heart
A riot in his head
As he falls off the edge to the floor Who do you think you are 
He gasps  Is this    Is this some sort of JOKE
 
Suddenly the strange wind is quiet
But no less strange the calm that comes after 
 I’m serious the voice says 
 
And Serious dies of laughter 
 
 
EPILOGUE
The dead man’s famous 
No one now remembers him alive
Or knows his name or anything he did 
Still a few stories survive
After all this while
Of a weird-looking man
With a weird-looking smile
That had it’s said
Almost a kind of life to it
Though the man was seriously dead 
 
And some remember how all the flies
Vanished for miles
And some say no no but the buzzards had weird smiles
As if they knew something 
And some tell of an old woman
Who would come and whisper in the dead man’s ear
And smooth the dead man’s hair
And if the door opened disappear 
There are even stories of that grim mortician
Who thought the smile undignified
And tugged and tugged so hard
He slipped and fell inside
Right on top of the dead man
Whose lips he swore seemed to soften
Seemed to somehow kiss 
And some remember this
Before the lid was sealed on that coffin
And the nails driven
There were on that face real tears 
And some say he smiled like a man forgiven 
 
The dead man never hears 
The dead man spins and spins
With his dumb dolphin grin
Through all the places where he is
When people talk of him again
In classrooms or in planes
In boredom or in pain
In front of screens
Or in the spotlight’s glare
In days too mild to bear
And in the long nights where
The dark grows steep
The wind wild
And a mother rises from her sleep
To calm her serious child
