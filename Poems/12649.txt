
Rose-cheekd Laura comeSing thou smoothly with thy beautysSilent music either other
      Sweetly gracing 
 Lovely forms do flowFrom concent divinely framedHeavn is music and thy beautys
      Birth is heavenly 
 These dull notes we singDiscords need for helps to grace themOnly beauty purely loving
      Knows no discordBut still moves delightLike clear springs renewd by flowingEver perfect ever in them-
      Selves eternal
