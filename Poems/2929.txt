
Sitting under the mistletoePale-green fairy mistletoeOne last candle burning lowAll the sleepy dancers goneJust one candle burning onShadows lurking everywhereSome one came and kissed me there Tired I was my head would goNodding under the mistletoePale-green fairy mistletoeNo footsteps came no voice but onlyJust as I sat there sleepy lonelyStooped in the still and shadowy airLips unseen and kissed me there
