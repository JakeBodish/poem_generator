april 1 
found on our driveway
  like a feather dropped     by a crow
 

  8 of spades        a playing    card 
 

       we played Crazy Eights slapping        cards or holding them        as if they were birds that might fly        out of our hands 
decades ago in our childhood
       like the translucent whirling        image I imagine prismatic and phosphorescent           a murmuration of starlings swooping        and iridescent 
but it dissolved onto a gray wall undecorated
        glimpses of us wearing our        velvet Sunday best dresses yours        usually crimson mine blue
 

       we never had nice shoes  
Now you have returned to water
 thanks to the Neptune Society spreading        your ashes over the Pacific

Ceylon tea   that amber cup
            from Sri Lanka popularly known here before
            Americans became tea drinkers as
                 Orange Pekoe
                        our mother hated
                        so many things   
                                              tea was
                                   rattlesnake venom to
                                                                     her
            I embraced it  
            What did you drink Marilyn I saw you only
with a Coke or a glass of wine in your hand
Our mother whom you felt
damaged you  your life       spirals the twisting iridescent birds
              fly at me now                       scintillating spinning
                                     I blink
Our mother drank many cups of coffee with cream a day 
Our sad mother
                                   I blink
                                   and tell it to go back to our childhood
                                   of muddy little shoes from walking in
                                   the spider-filled orange groves 
There the damaging must have Begun   she
                                   loving me so much
                                                                      more
                                                                      than you 
I wish there had been more stories
like the one about the origin of her disliking tea
            at 17 she went to celebrate being made teacher
            of the one-room school she had attended and
            graduated from at her retiring teacher’s
            home she was served for the first time   tea she
            being from a German coffee-drinking family 
            Our mother hated it but politely choked it down 
            Would never again touch a drop of the
            poisonous beverage 
From that story we learned that
our mother ritualized hating something   expected us
to admire her for it 
                        I took
                        that negative pattern
                        and spun it until I could have cloth enough
for an eloquent garment  Perhaps the lesson simply made you
feel yourself            helpless         ragged                      torn
I never
saw you that way Marilyn
though perhaps incomplete 
I pour a cup of Assam  Take a sip
            let it wash through my mouth
                        down my age-damaged throat
think
of you sitting
with me in your Southern California 
backyard one May morning
next to the camellia bush 
I as always with a cup of tea in my hand 
You smoking 
I left all my family   you were part of it   
left California and reinvented myself even
mythologized myself as a tan “California Girl ”
You did not become an artist or a poet 
I suppose that’s why you felt damaged 
If only you knew how much imagination and sacrifice
it took for me to get away 
                        So many small things
                                   can save us
                                             from the damage
you talked of  For me drinking that
first cup of Orange Pekoe
and making tea
my drink      risking rattlesnake poison
with every steaming cup
a tiny emblem of a rebellion I still try to practice 
You left us so quickly Marilyn
and without any warning this January
your house full of cancelled aspirations   glass
bowls and cylinders and huge globes
filled with sea scallop shells
            you combed the California seashores to 
                        find collecting these empty shells washed
free of their biological life                                  Out of the ocean
we two different daughters of a sailor

The spinning                      the scissors               the measuring
and thus our lives are given out
from the heavens with unfair allotments
and varied unaccountable fates
born when we are and to whom
you would have prevailed
in an age where women had to spin
weave the material cut it into britches and dresses
undergarments and sheets sew
and keep clean warm and comfortable a
household full or a castle full  men
children hired hands maidservants   you would have
done it
so well 
But you would have died young in such a world   
diabetes asthma chronic bronchial infections
even in the 21st century where you lived to be
76       a world where all your skills were plied as
            substitute
for being an artist 
                      When I asked you a year ago
not knowing that you would die this January
what you would most like to have if
money were not the object
               since clearly all your measuring cutting and sewing
            had been for economical reasons
            not art   
you thought for a bit raising your chin 
“A swimming pool in my backyard  One I could
step into every morning swim float   maybe in the afternoon
I’d go for a dip  Many evenings I think” she said
to me                      Longing for some ocean 
In our portrait
if someone paints it she will be 
sitting in a scallop shell
her many jars of seashells behind her head  I
will be invisible except for the spinning 
murmuration of birds that radiates
            past me  
They read at her funeral a poem from her journal
about lying on the beach
the sand embracing her 
How much she loved it  felt safe
felt released  Oh Marilyn all
those seashells emptied of their living
fleshy occupants  the ugly parts that die and rot now
glorious empty rooms
            in which to live an imaginary life
                        to decorate
to create beauty 
            spaces to live
                        a different life 
What is left but your desires locked in glass and
an image of you walking
your beloved beaches hands 
full of seashells your
footprints measured then quickly filled 
with the tidal flow

my spinning 
            a whirlpool of faceted moving lights
                        Everything is Numbers
down into a vortical glare that replaces
            my own mind’s desire 
                        Everything is Numbers Everything is Numbers
floating down
            like the crow’s
                        onyx feather
the 8
            of spades
                        random card

            last week
                        over gravel
8 legs on a spider
            the arachnid so many people seem to
            fear yet I lose track of time stare into the wall
            or any space to replace real images with my imaginary
            ones some random spider who spins my fate
Crazy Eights the child card game Marilyn and I played
pieces of eight the dollar of
            pirate Spain   our childhood in Orange County
8 a vertical infinity sign
            everything is numbers  your
                        fire opal that Daddy brought
to you from India and our mother
paid a jeweler to set it
into a ring  You wore the ring
more than sixty years  I suppose it was
on your finger at death
spinning     spinning
to scintillate and iridesce
            We never had nice shoes

Easter Sunday  You and I always dyed
Easter eggs together our mother busy at
her forty-hour-a-week bookkeeper’s job  I 
was intrigued with the colors
but they never turned out so bright when
coloring the eggs  You the artist
were interested in the designs
to transfer onto the eggs
cartoons bunnies
chicks 
We kept our eggs
separated from each other
put them in separate bowls neither
caring for the other’s creation  Still we
felt connected even joyful on those few holiday projects 
Not enough to make us friends 
My unwillingness to be like our classmates
embarrassed you  You chose invisibility
in school rather than being known as “Diane’s
Sister ” 
That unwillingness to be like others 
was what made me a poet  So many little things but that early decision
of yours not to understand why I wanted to be weird
is what made you make so 
many other small choices preventing you 
from becoming an artist  “Look away” our mother said to us
when there were ugly things confronting us  
I could not do that  You blame
our mother yet it was you who decided to look away
even though it meant not seeing the whole world
even if meant you didn’t become an artist 
Poverty of course was the reason
we never had nice shoes

All numbers have
disappeared
                        instead
            there are mushrooms
            fungi that has always seemed
            more artful than tasty
            Sipping a cup of tea  soothes me
            as the mushrooms in a veloute sauce
            never could 
            I feel stymied  a rider
            with no horse  I want only to watch
            the stories unfold  the secret stories about why
            you chose to marry and have children  why
            I did not  the stories
                                    I try to banish
            blot out replace with the diamond
            dog  A murmuration of iridescent starlings 
            and the spider of eight 
            twirling on its silk line projecting infinity      art
            is made when you subject yourself
            to the unacceptable then dredge
            yourself out
                                    find a mineral replacement
            infinity
            iridescer
            irised feather
            scintillater
                        a crystalline body whirls
            releasing me from
            the history the stories it’s
            so hard to tell 
Until recent years my sister
and I either ignored or disliked each other 
We fought continuously as children 
I have in my wrist a black bump that
protrudes near a vein 
                                    It’s the point of a pencil
that broke off and penetrated my wrist as we struggled
for the long yellow weapon 
A pencil the weapon of a writer  But there was 
no bleeding no seeming-wound to be dressed  
We never told
our Mother both too ashamed
of our brutality  I’ve never asked a doctor
about it the pencil lead encapsulated
in my wrist  Nor ever spoken
of it to anyone 
I always wonder that so much must remain a secret
Why
            we never had nice shoes

Young Marilyn Old Marilyn 
there are places on this planet where
I find it hard to detect any beauty
therefore silence

Drinking
a blend of traditional
Darjeeling with a touch of Ceylon  this
tea takes me back to a Viennese visit drinking
this very tea in the afternoon while my friend Jonathan
ate their famous Sacher torte 
The tea
seemed particularly aromatic   
            “lightly scented with oil of bergamot
            and a hint of genuine Bourbon vanilla ”
Wishing for the moment in the past to reappear  I didn’t know
the tea from the Sacher Hotel
was as famous as the cake
                                until I found in my Upton Tea catalogue
                                a listing for “Scented Darjeeling”
                                under the heading “Earl Grey Blends”
This tea
any cup of tea
Hard to believe  no Sad to
think my Mother almost spat out her first taste
of tea 
What worldly thing must I touch to
bring Marilyn back into my
sedate life my sister Marilyn who died in January 
Her hand   I’d like to imagine timidly touching her
      hand   Marilyn’s hand 
            Her right hand on which she wore the fire opal ring 
                        In that hand she’d be holding a cigarette 
Smoke and fire makes me think of her   
            not water though it was that Pacific ocean 
                        filled with seashells
                                    that she was in touch with  My old hands
not really like hers at all  She had big hands for shaping things
            while mine are small      like birds
