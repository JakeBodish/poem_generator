
…When that joy is gone for good
I move the arms beneath the blood 
 
When my blood is running wild
I sew the clothing of a child 
 
When that child is never born
I lean my breast against a thorn 
 
When the thorn brings no reprieve
I rise and live I rise and live 
 
When I live from hand to hand
Nude in the marketplace I stand 
 
When I stand and am not sold
I build a fire against the cold 
 
When the cold does not destroy
I leap from ambush on my joy…
