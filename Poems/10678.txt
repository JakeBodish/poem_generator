
A day will come I’ll watch you reading this I’ll look up from these words I’m writing now this line I’m standing on I’ll be right herealive again  I’ll breathe on you this breath Touch this word now that one  Warm isn’t it You are the person come to clean my roomyou are whichever of my three childrenopens the drawer here where this poem will goin a few minutes when I’ve had my say  These are the words from immortality No one stands between us now except DeathI enter it entirely writing this I have to tell you I am not alone Watching you read Eternity’s with me We like to watch you read  Read us again
