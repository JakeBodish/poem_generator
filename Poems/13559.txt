
I wave good-bye when butter flies
and cheer a boxing match
Ive often watched my pillow fight
Ive sewn a cabbage patch
I like to dance at basket balls
or lead a rubber band
Ive marvelled at a spelling bee
Ive helped a peanut stand 
Its possible a pencil points
but does a lemon drop
Does coffee break or chocolate kiss
and will a soda pop
I share my milk with drinking straws
my meals with chewing gum
and should I see my pocket change
Ill hear my kettle drum 
It makes me sad when lettuce leaves
I laugh when dinner rolls
I wonder if the kitchen sinks
and if a salad bowls
Ive listened to a diamond ring
Ive waved a football fan
and if a chimney sweeps the floor
Im sure the garbage can
