
My dolls have been put away like deadchildren in a chest I will carrywith me when I marry I reach under my skirt to feela satin slip bought for this day  It is softas the inside of my thighs  My hairhas been nailed back with my mother’sblack hairpins to my skull  Her handsstretched my eyes open as she twistedbraids into a tight circle at the napeof my neck  I am to wash my own clothesand sheets from this day on as ifthe fluids of my body were poison as ifthe little trickle of blood I believetravels from my heart to the world wereshameful  Is not the blood of saints andmen in battle beautiful Do Christ’s handsnot bleed into your eyes from His crossAt night I hear myself growing and waketo find my hands drifting of their own willto soothe skin stretched tightover my bonesI am wound like the guts of a clockwaiting for each hour to release me
