
Like fossil shells embedded in a stoneyou are an absence rimmed calligraphya mouthing out of silence a way to seebeyond the bedroom where you lie alone So why not be the vast antipodal cloudyou soloed under riven by cold galesAnd why not be the song of diving whaleswhy not the plosive surf   below the roadThe others are one thing  They know they are One compass needle  They have found their way and navigate by perfect cynosure Go wreck yourself once more against the dayand wash up like a bottle on the shorelucidity and salt in all you say
