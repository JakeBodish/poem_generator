
Wherever we go needs feed and I find it harder and harder to
believe benevolence is the thing Thousands of Yazidi girls
missing and plastic fills the ocean’s mouth and the cursive of
yr name still occupies the canopy of my throat Fuel the under-
pinning What fires your gd engine Rigor mortis Cold as
unmoving or unmoved The opposite of music Warm in the
cold universe Molten forming A rock becoming magma
becoming lava becoming land Land the trauma of lava Lava
the lamp of the ancestors and later a cheeky find in the Junk
shop and rising in our living room Livin groom Just bc nothingcares doesn’t mean it lacks meaning What’s the point of
curiosity but a train rolling past the spot where the Donner
Party feasted n then go on a four hour Wikipedia downward
spiral I’m the closest thing to a mime parade I whisper home
late tiptoeing down the creaky hallway tryin not to wake my
roommates Nice chicken parm sluts I say to my fingers at
lunch Dissociation is evacuating from the inside I just know
we’ll have a good time
