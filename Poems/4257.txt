
It is pretty to be sweet
and full of pardon like
a flower perfuming the
hands that shred it but
all piety leads to a single
point the same paradise
where dead lab rats go 
If you live small you’ll
be resurrected with the
small a whole planet
of minor gods simpering
in the weeds  I don’t know
anyone who would kill
anyone for me  As boys
my brother and I
would play love me
drawing stars on
the soles of his feet
him tickling my back 
Then we’d play harm
him cataloging my sins
to the air me throwing
him into furniture 
The algorithms for living
have always been
delicious and hollow
like a beetle husk in a
spider’s paw  Hafez said
fear is the cheapest room
in a house that we ought
to live in better
conditions  I would
happily trade all my
knowing for plusher
carpet higher ceilings 
Some nights I force
my brain to dream me
Persian by listening
to old home movies
as I fall asleep  In the
mornings I open my eyes
and spoil the séance  Am I
forfeiting my mystique
All bodies become sicker
bodies  This is a kind of object
permanence a curse bent
around our scalps resembling
grace only at the tattered
edges  It’s so unsettling
to feel anything but good 
I wish I was only as cruel as
the first time I noticed
I was cruel waving my tiny
shadow over a pond to scare
the copper minnows 
Rockabye now I lay me
down et cetera  The world
is what accumulates   
the mouth full of meat
the earth full of meat 
My grandfather
taught his parrot
the ninety-nine holy
names of God  Al-Muzil
The Humiliator  Al-Waarith
The Heir  Once after
my grandfather had been
dead for a year I woke
from a dream I was a
sultan guzzling flies
from a crystal boot with
his walking cane deep
in my mouth  I kept sucking
until I fell back asleep 
There are only two bones
in the throat and that’s if you
count the clavicle  This
seems unsafe overdelicate
like I ought to ask for
a third  As if anyone
living would offer Corporeal friends are
spiritual enemies
