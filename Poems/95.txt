          Planetarium born in 1958 New York City  In his youth deGrasse Tyson was
          confronted by police on more than one occasion when he was on his way to
          study stars 
“I’ve known that I’ve wanted to do astrophysics since I was nine years old a first visit to the Hayden Planetarium   So I got to see how the world around me reacted to my expression of these ambitions   all I can say is the fact that I wanted to be a scientist an astrophysicist was hands down the path of most resistance   Anytime I expressed this interest teachers would say Don’t you want to be an athlete Or Don’t you wanna   I wanted to become something that was outside of the paradigms of expectation of the people in power 
And I look behind me and say Well where are the others who might have been this And they’re not there  And I wonder What is the thing along the tracks that I happened to survive and others did not Simply because of the forces that prevented it  At every turn  At every turn ”

The Skyview apartments
                    circa 1973 a boy is
kneeling on the rooftop a boy who
                     it is important
to mention here his skin
                    is brown prepares his telescope
the weights  rods
                    to better see the moon  His neighbor
it is important to mention here
                    that she is white calls the police
because she suspects the brown boy
                    of something she does not know
what at first then turns                    with her looking
his telescope into a gun
                    his duffel into a bag of objects
thieved from the neighbors’ houses
                     maybe even hers  the police
it is important to mention
                    that statistically they
are also white arrive to find
                    the boy who has been turned by now
into “the suspect” on the roof
                    with a long black lens which is
in the neighbor’s mind a weapon 
                    depending on who you are reading this
you know that the boy is in grave danger
                     you might have known
somewhere quiet in your gut
                    you might have worried for him
in the white space between lines 5  6                    or maybe even earlier  you might be holding
your breath for him right now
                    because you know this story
it’s a true story though
                    miraculously in this version
of the story anyway
                    the boy on the roof of the Skyview lives
to tell the police that he is studying
                    the night  moon  lives
long enough to offer them the cops a view
                    through his telescope’s long black eye which
if I am spelling it out anyway
                    is the instrument he borrowed
 the beautiful “trouble” he went through
                    lugging it up to the roof
to better see the leopard body of
                    space speckled with stars  the moon far off
much farther than since I am spelling The Thing
                    out the distance between
the white neighbor who cannot see the boy
                    who is her neighbor who
in fact is much nearer
                    to her than to the moon the boy who
wants to understand the large
                     gloriously un-human mysteries of
the galaxy the boy who despite “America”
                    has not been killed by the murderous jury of
his neighbor’s imagination  wound  This poem                    wants only the moon in its hair  the boy on the roof 
This boy on the roof of this poem
                    with a moon in his heart  Inside my own body
as I write this poem my body
                    is making a boy even as the radio
calls out the Missouri coroner’s news
                    the Ohio coroner’s news 
2015  My boy will nod
                    for his milk  close his mouth around
the black eye of my nipple 
                    We will survive  How did it happen
The boy  The cops  My body in this poem 
                    My milk pulling down into droplets of light
as the baby drinks  drinks them down
                    into the body that is his own see it
splayed  sighing as a star in my arms                     Maybe he will be the boy who studies stars 
Maybe he will be say it
                    the boy on the coroner’s table
splayed  spangled
                    by an officer’s lead as if he too weren’t made
of a trillion glorious cells  sentences  Trying to last 
 
 
Leadless remember The body’s beginning
splendored with breaths turned
by time into at least this song 
 
This moment-made  the mackerel-“soul”
caught flashing inside the brief moment of the body’s net
then whoosh back into the sea of space 
 
The poem dreams of bodies always leadless bearing
only things ordinary
as water  light
