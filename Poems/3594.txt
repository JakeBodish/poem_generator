

Echo of the clocktower footstep
in the alleyway sweep
of the wind sifting the leaves 
Jeweller of the spiderweb connoisseur
of autumns opulence blade of lightning
harvesting the sky 
Keeper of the small gate choreographer
of entrances and exits midnight
whisper traveling the wires 
Seducer healer deity or thief
I will see you soon enough 
in the shadow of the rainfall
in the brief violet darkening a sunset 
but until then I pray watch over him
as a mountain guards its covert ore
and the harsh falcon its flightless young
