Fair to admit it’s mostly
tundra to the west in the park past Toklat
the Denali I revised low grasslands
engineered to freeze deep
by October   this being Alaska   the great
            Tabularium close to the Temple of
            Castor and Pollux I rebuilt that same summer   
            not superimposed exact as any scheme
in secret   the Arch of Septimius Severus at the gravel bar
