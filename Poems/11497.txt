
Pain trains an undisciplined mind  I will end yours if  you end mine  Little feet little feet are playing Hopscotch among the landmines  Hope has worked miracles before  If  yours didnt how can mine I could have learned to welcome night If only  you had been mine  How dare you put words in Gods mouth Shail  Why not  He put ashes in mine
