
Dull to myself and almost dead to theseMy many fresh and fragrant mistressesLost to all music now since everythingPuts on the semblance here of sorrowing Sick is the land to th heart and doth endureMore dangerous faintings by her desprate cure But if that golden age would come againAnd Charles here rule as he before did reignIf smooth and unperplexd the seasons wereAs when the sweet Maria lived hereI should delight to have my curls half drowndIn Tyrian dews and head with roses crownd And once more yet ere I am laid out deadKnock at a star with my exalted head
