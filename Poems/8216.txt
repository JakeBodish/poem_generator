
A new volcano has erupted
the papers say and last week I was reading   
where some ship saw an island being born   
at first a breath of steam ten miles away   
and then a black fleck basalt probably 
rose in the mate’s binoculars
and caught on the horizon like a fly 
They named it  But my poor old island’s still   
un-rediscovered un-renamable 
None of the books has ever got it right 
Well I had fifty-two
miserable small volcanoes I could climb   
with a few slithery strides 
volcanoes dead as ash heaps 
I used to sit on the edge of the highest one   
and count the others standing up
naked and leaden with their heads blown off    
I’d think that if they were the size   
I thought volcanoes should be then I had   
become a giant
and if I had become a giant
I couldn’t bear to think what size   
the goats and turtles were
or the gulls or the overlapping rollers   
 a glittering hexagon of rollers   
closing and closing in but never quite   
glittering and glittering though the sky   
was mostly overcast 
My island seemed to be
a sort of cloud-dump  All the hemisphere’s   
left-over clouds arrived and hung
above the craters their parched throats   
were hot to touch 
Was that why it rained so much
And why sometimes the whole place hissed   
The turtles lumbered by high-domed   
hissing like teakettles 
And I’d have given years or taken a few   
for any sort of kettle of course 
The folds of lava running out to sea
would hiss  I’d turn  And then they’d prove   
to be more turtles 
The beaches were all lava variegated   
black red and white and gray
the marbled colors made a fine display    
And I had waterspouts  Oh
half a dozen at a time far out
they’d come and go advancing and retreating   
their heads in cloud their feet in moving patches   
of scuffed-up white 
Glass chimneys flexible attenuated   
sacerdotal beings of glass     I watched   
the water spiral up in them like smoke    
Beautiful yes but not much company 
I often gave way to self-pity 
“Do I deserve this I suppose I must 
I wouldn’t be here otherwise  Was there   
a moment when I actually chose this
I don’t remember but there could have been ”   
What’s wrong about self-pity anyway
With my legs dangling down familiarly   
over a crater’s edge I told myself
“Pity should begin at home ” So the more   
pity I felt the more I felt at home 
The sun set in the sea the same odd sun   
rose from the sea
and there was one of it and one of me    
The island had one kind of everything   
one tree snail a bright violet-blue
with a thin shell crept over everything   
over the one variety of tree
a sooty scrub affair 
Snail shells lay under these in drifts   
and at a distance
you’d swear that they were beds of irises    
There was one kind of berry a dark red    
I tried it one by one and hours apart    
Sub-acid and not bad no ill effects   
and so I made home-brew  I’d drink   
the awful fizzy stinging stuff
that went straight to my head
and play my home-made flute
I think it had the weirdest scale on earth   
and dizzy whoop and dance among the goats    
Home-made home-made But aren’t we all   
I felt a deep affection for
the smallest of my island industries    
No not exactly since the smallest was   
a miserable philosophy 
Because I didn’t know enough 
Why didn’t I know enough of something   
Greek drama or astronomy The books   
I’d read were full of blanks
the poems well I tried
reciting to my iris-beds
“They flash upon that inward eye
which is the bliss    ” The bliss of what   
One of the first things that I did
when I got back was look it up 
The island smelled of goat and guano    
The goats were white so were the gulls   
and both too tame or else they thought   
I was a goat too or a gull Baa baa baa and shriek shriek shriek
baa     shriek
