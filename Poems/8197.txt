1 
Three did not count 
A fourth was forgiven by the Father Torres
In exchange for reasonable payment
Two full days of the Hail Mary 
Bigger than priests the fifth
Indiscretion was born on a Thursday early
Evening in a November not too cold 
No rain had fallen
And the birds had not yet gone 
She chose a black dress this Flora Florita
 here evoke the names of saints 
Underneath which she carried tonight
An old blade but of fine Toledo forging
Long as the member of this man
In love with this woman standing at his door 
Her head was filled with the vines of the jungle
The noises of a lion the feel of ten birds
Trying with their beaks to get out 
All anger that she had hoped he would
Come to her bedroom 
And that he had 
Faster than that she took from him his rolled tongue
Hanging there between his thin legs his two-fingers
This girl’s wrist and fist of his
Its central tendon and skin that moved on itself
This small and second body of his
Which had found its way to her second mouth
This part of himself which he had given her
Then taken back on this same day earlier
His ugly afternoon of loving her too much 
He would scream as she had
When she had taken him in first as a leg-bone
And held him there too long too much
Until he had become a pinky-finger
 here evoke the holy names 
Which she took now and put in the dowry
She would make for her new daughter 
With it she would write a note
Nothing else was left to doDaughter you will be an only child 
The story of your birth will smell on you 
Do this take baths filled with rosemary
With leaves with pinched orange peels 
Keep secret the fact of yourself 
Be happy enough happy with this much life 
Ask for nothing  Do not live for a long time
