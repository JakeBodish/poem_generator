Chicago is an overgrown woman
      wearing her skyscrapers
      like a necklace    
Chicago’s blood is kaleidoscopic
Chicago’s heart has a hundred auricles
              
                                  From the Congo
                                  to Chicago
                                  is a long trek
                                   as the crow flies
