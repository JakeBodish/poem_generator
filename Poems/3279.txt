
A child is something else again  Wakes up
in the afternoon and in an instant hes full of words
in an instant hes humming in an instant warm
instant light instant darkness 
A child is Job  Theyve already placed their bets on him
but he doesnt know it  He scratches his body
for pleasure  Nothing hurts yet 
Theyre training him to be a polite Job
to say Thank you when the Lord has given
to say Youre welcome when the Lord has taken away 
A child is vengeance 
A child is a missile into the coming generations 
I launched him Im still trembling 
A child is something else again on a rainy spring day
glimpsing the Garden of Eden through the fence
kissing him in his sleep
hearing footsteps in the wet pine needles 
A child delivers you from death 
Child Garden Rain Fate
