
I wore Grandma Lizs pearls
for play a plastic strand long
enough to pool on the carpet
over my stubbed toes  When I pull
them over my head now I smell
phantoms cigarettes Esteé
Lauder  I dont smoke or spritz
on perfume  I dont layer polyester
or perm my hair  Ive slipped off
my wedding ring as she did signed
divorce  What advice would she offer
for life between husbands Wear redlipstick and always leave it behind
