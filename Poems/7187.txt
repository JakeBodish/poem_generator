
What beckning ghost along the moon-light shadeInvites my steps and points to yonder gladeTis she but why that bleeding bosom gordWhy dimly gleams the visionary swordOh ever beauteous ever friendly tellIs it in heavn a crime to love too wellTo bear too tender or too firm a heartTo act a lovers or a Romans partIs there no bright reversion in the skyFor those who greatly think or bravely die
     Why bade ye else ye powrs her soul aspireAbove the vulgar flight of low desireAmbition first sprung from your blest abodesThe glorious fault of angels and of godsThence to their images on earth it flowsAnd in the breasts of kings and heroes glows Most souls tis true but peep out once an ageDull sullen prisners in the bodys cageDim lights of life that burn a length of yearsUseless unseen as lamps in sepulchresLike eastern kings a lazy state they keepAnd close confind to their own palace sleep 
     From these perhaps ere nature bade her dieFate snatchd her early to the pitying sky As into air the purer spirits flowAnd seprate from their kindred dregs belowSo flew the soul to its congenial placeNor left one virtue to redeem her race 
     But thou false guardian of a charge too goodThou mean deserter of thy brothers bloodSee on these ruby lips the trembling breathThese cheeks now fading at the blast of deathCold is that breast which warmd the world beforeAnd those love-darting eyes must roll no more Thus if eternal justice rules the ballThus shall your wives and thus your children fallOn all the line a sudden vengeance waitsAnd frequent hearses shall besiege your gates There passengers shall stand and pointing sayWhile the long funrals blacken all the wayLo these were they whose souls the furies steeldAnd cursd with hearts unknowing how to yield Thus unlamented pass the proud awayThe gaze of fools and pageant of a daySo perish all whose breast neer learnd to glowFor others good or melt at others woe 
     What can atone oh ever-injurd shadeThy fate unpitied and thy rites unpaidNo friends complaint no kind domestic tearPleasd thy pale ghost or gracd thy mournful bier By foreign hands thy dying eyes were closdBy foreign hands thy decent limbs composdBy foreign hands thy humble grave adorndBy strangers honourd and by strangers mourndWhat though no friends in sable weeds appearGrieve for an hour perhaps then mourn a yearAnd bear about the mockery of woeTo midnight dances and the public showWhat though no weeping loves thy ashes graceNor polishd marble emulate thy faceWhat though no sacred earth allow thee roomNor hallowd dirge be mutterd oer thy tombYet shall thy grave with rising flowrs be drestAnd the green turf lie lightly on thy breastThere shall the morn her earliest tears bestowThere the first roses of the year shall blowWhile angels with their silver wings oershadeThe ground now sacred by thy reliques made 
     So peaceful rests without a stone a nameWhat once had beauty titles wealth and fame How lovd how honourd once avails thee notTo whom related or by whom begotA heap of dust alone remains of theeTis all thou art and all the proud shall be
     Poets themselves must fall like those they sungDeaf the praisd ear and mute the tuneful tongue Evn he whose soul now melts in mournful laysShall shortly want the genrous tear he paysThen from his closing eyes thy form shall partAnd the last pang shall tear thee from his heartLifes idle business at one gasp be oerThe Muse forgot and thou belovd no more
