
Nothing nastier than a white person 
She mutters as she irons alterations
in the backroom of Charlotte’s Dress Shoppe    
The steam rising from a cranberry wool   
comes alive with perspiration
and stale Evening of Paris Swamp she born from swamp
she swallow swamp she got to sink again
