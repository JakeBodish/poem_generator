The white butterfly in the park is being read by many 
I love that cabbage-moth as if it were a fluttering corner of truth itself
At dawn the running crowds set our quiet planet in motion 
Then the park fills with people  To each one eight faces polished like jade for all
       situations to avoid making mistakes 
To each one theres also the invisible face reflecting something you dont talk about 
Something that appears in tired moments and is as rank as a gulp of viper schnapps                with its long scaly aftertaste 
The carp in the pond move continuously swimming while they sleep setting an   example for the faithful always in motion

Its midday  Laundry flutters in the gray sea-wind high over the cyclists
who arrive in dense schools  Notice the labrinths on each side
Im surrounded by written characters that I cant interpret Im illiterate through and            through 
But Ive paid what I owe and have receipts for everything 
Ive accumulated so many illegible receipts 
Im an old tree with withered leaves that hang on and cant fall to the ground 
And a gust from the sea gets all these receipts rustling

 At dawn the trampling hordes set our quiet planet in motion 
Were all aboard the street and its as crammed as the deck of  a ferry 
Where are we headed Are there enough teacups We should consider ourselves lucky
       to have made it aboard this street
Its a thousand years before the birth of claustrophobia 
Hovering behind each of us who walks here is a cross that wants to catch up with us
        pass us unite with us 
Something that wants to sneak up on us from behind put its hands over our eyes and
        whisper Guess who
We look almost happy out in the sun while we bleed to death from wounds we dont
        know about
