
Fair is my love and cruel as shes fairHer brow shades frowns although her eyes are sunnyHer smiles are lightning though her pride despairAnd her disdains are gall her favours honeyA modest maid deckd with a blush of honourWhose feet do tread green paths of youth and loveThe wonder of all eyes that look upon herSacred on earth designd a saint above Chastity and beauty which were deadly foesLive reconciled friends within her browAnd had she pity to conjoin with thoseThen who had heard the plaints I utter nowFor had she not been fair and thus unkindMy muse had slept and none had known my mind
