
The day upturned flooded with sunlight nota single cloud  I squint into the glarecautious even then of bright emptiness We sit under shade Tía Luciashowing me how white folks dine the high life I am about to try my first oysterTía spending her winnings from the slotson a whole dozen the glistening valveswet and private as a cheek’s other side broken open before us  Don’t be shy Take it all in at once  Flesh and sea gritsweet meat and brine a taste I must acquire  In every split shell the coast’s silhouette bodies floating in what was once their home
