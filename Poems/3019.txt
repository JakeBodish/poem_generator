
Im selling my old rock records
the reggae and the Dead
the Beatles and bands
no one heard after the Amazing
Kathy Dalton became less so
and Airto busted for possession
his albums face behind ten fingers
blacked with stationhouse ink 
deported  A Stone retired
Mick past fifty Van Morrison 
composer of the worlds best
Celtic fuck music gone spiritual
while Peaceful Easy Feeling
sells Prozac and the trippy
paisley vinyl of Dave Masons
Alone Together Big Brothers
funky R  Crumb cover fat nipply Janis
dragging that ball and chain are quaint
collectibles like Fiestaware or bottles
from defunct breweries useful things
no one uses anymore worth money
