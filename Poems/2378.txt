
So I go to Ashenda
to get some fix
Shandar there
playing his lute
 a dark haired angel
combing a violin
I cry Anatolia Anatolia
Im a nightingale shrieking
dawns first flick
Im the unknown soldier
singing its me again
I say one more
 Im ready for the Western World
Then Im at a bar
with Lucinda
 were drooling
on the body on
discipline and the reign
of Robespierre
Then its consummation time
 I say hey
theres a ram butting
at the door  a widows
crying for something
I say Lucinda
Ive got a drum in my belly
 she says
Im a goddamn
shivering eel
Then its polka
on a South Dakota lawn
Shandar doodling
Shahrazad stomping
by the window
soaking up the light
Then we all smoke Camels
 Lucinda says
I wish I could live
without having to disown
 I say yeah
tell me more
about that
