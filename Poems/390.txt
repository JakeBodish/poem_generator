circled and were encircled and had no cause  It was a time of the self come on in a field of
apparatuses  It was vignetted by sleep and the sleep was in its center breached  Cold moving
through the smell of gas  The big-leafed enclosure  It was a time that clattered at the horizons
whose recounting was already foreclosed as in a numeral smudged in powder as in a thin water
making of the atmosphere a disc  It was a time of guzzling  A time amid what has been kept a
time of calendered trust repeated appeal erasures of flight  We begin with a weedy stem drawn
against the winter sky  Dear hierophant our decision initialed  The muffled sound of the closet
and the machine
