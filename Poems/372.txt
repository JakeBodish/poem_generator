                                   theres still time  
                               Marcus Aurelius 3 14



Citizen of Rome you are the center of the universe 
Problem is circumference is take a guess me 
 
“Some things are impatient to be born
While others are impatient to die ” Don’t say
 
I did not warn you  Next time they swear
Shit happens pop them square in the nose 
 
This will not help anybody but helping is
The farthest thing from my imperial mind 
 
If you keep your spirit blameless and pure
People will drape you with laurels but
 
No one will have sex with you in backseats
Or marble mausoleums or anywhere else
 
A small price to pay for honor and respect
Though not for me being an emperor with no clothes 
 
Just pretend today is the last day of your life
And act accordingly not that such strictures
 
Apply to Yours Truly sports fans 
The forces of evil march on the fortress
 
Of your self  I wish I could explain why 
But what if evil did not exist and what if
 
Your self was no fortress see what I mean
Stoics get a bad name  Not in touch with feelings 
 Too rigid  Know-it-all cocksure mothers 
So the Stoics retain PR firms don’t tell a soul 
 
If you really knew what was good for you
And you do why do you care I’ll flail you alive
 
True pissing off your emperor is a poor plan
Even one like me mounted bare-assed on a steed 
 
Once upon a time children…The story peters out 
Circus revels and gladiatorial raves 
 
Seen one seem them all  Life is tiresome
When will it end and will we ever notice
 
I wish I knew  Really I wish I cared 
My pal Marcus Aurelius natters day and night
 
“Living is more like wrestling than dancing ”
Guess he never saw me take Molly at the club 
 
And he says we always have the option of
Having no opinion  Right  Like he knows 
 
OK then where did I put my pants
