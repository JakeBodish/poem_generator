
Dear why should you command me to my restWhen now the night doth summon all to sleepMethinks this time becometh lovers bestNight was ordaind together friends to keep How happy are all other living thingsWhich though the day disjoin by sevral flightThe quiet evning yet together bringsAnd each returns unto his love at nightO thou that art so courteous else to allWhy shouldst thou Night abuse me only thusThat evry creature to his kind dost callAnd yet tis thou dost only sever usWell could I wish it would be ever dayIf when night comes you bid me go away
