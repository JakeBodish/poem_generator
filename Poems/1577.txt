
It is a sultry day the sun has drunkThe dew that lay upon the morning grassThere is no rustling in the lofty elmThat canopies my dwelling and its shadeScarce cools me  All is silent save the faintAnd interrupted murmur of the beeSettling on the sick flowers and then againInstantly on the wing  The plants aroundFeel the too potent fervors the tall maizeRolls up its long green leaves the clover droopsIts tender foliage and declines its blooms But far in the fierce sunshine tower the hillsWith all their growth of woods silent and sternAs if the scorching heat and dazzling lightWere but an element they loved  Bright cloudsMotionless pillars of the brazen heaven–Their bases on the mountains–their white topsShining in the far ether–fire the airWith a reflected radiance and make turnThe gazer’s eye away  For me I lieLanguidly in the shade where the thick turfYet virgin from the kisses of the sunRetains some freshness and I woo the windThat still delays his coming  Why so slowGentle and voluble spirit of the airOh come and breathe upon the fainting earthCoolness and life Is it that in his cavesHe hears me See on yonder woody ridgeThe pine is bending his proud top and nowAmong the nearer groves chestnut and oakAre tossing their green boughs about  He comesLo where the grassy meadow runs in wavesThe deep distressful silence of the sceneBreaks up with mingling of unnumbered soundsAnd universal motion  He is comeShaking a shower of blossoms from the shrubsAnd bearing on their fragrance and he bringsMusic of birds and rustling of young boughsAnd sound of swaying branches and the voiceOf distant waterfalls  All the green herbsAre stirring in his breath a thousand flowersBy the road-side and the borders of the brookNod gayly to each other glossy leavesAre twinkling in the sun as if the dewWere on them yet and silver waters breakInto small waves and sparkle as he comes
