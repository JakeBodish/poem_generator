
Like labour-laden moonclouds faint to flee
     From winds that sweep the winter-bitten wold 
     Like multiform circumfluence manifoldOf nights flood-tide like terrors that agreeOf hoarse-tongued fire and inarticulate sea 
     Even such within some glass dimmd by our breath
     Our hearts discern wild images of DeathShadows and shoals that edge eternity Howbeit athwart Deaths imminent shade doth soar
     One Power than flow of stream or flight of dove
     Sweeter to glide around to brood above Tell me my heart what angel-greeted doorOr threshold of wing-winnowd threshing-floor
     Hath guest fire-fledgd as thine whose lord is Love
