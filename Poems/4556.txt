
This disease has come backWith frills and furbelows You must give your whole life to poetryOnly a few survive if that 
Poems I mean paper crumpledShades of another water 
Far springs are what you long forListening for the slow drip of chemicals
Through a hole in your chest If you were torn from meI could not bear what the earth had to offer
