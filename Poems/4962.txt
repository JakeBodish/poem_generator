
I want to leave this placeunremembered The gas stove is leakingand the door of the refrigeratorstained with rust The mugs are uglyand there are only two forks The walls are blackand soft the bed a balloonof night-clothing The stairwell slopedto a dragger’s pace There are big windowswith blind-slats dustyand gray  Street life goes all night and at dawnfreedmen shout and laugh outside the kitchen Where does life begin and endIn the lamb or the cottonMy pillow is my friend
