
One hour as dim he and his house now lookAs a reflection in a rippling brookWhile I remember him but first his house Empty it sounded  It was dark with forest boughsThat brushed the walls and made the mossy tilesPart of the squirrels’ track  In all those milesOf forest silence and forest murmur onlyOne house “Lonely” he said “I wish it were lonely” Which the trees looked upon from every sideAnd that was his                           He waved good-bye to hideA sigh that he converted to a laugh He seemed to hang rather than stand there halfGhost-like half like a beggar’s rag clean wrungAnd useless on the brier where it has hungLong years a-washing by sun and wind and rain But why I call back man and house againIs that now on a beech-tree’s tip I seeAs then I saw I at the gate and heIn the house darkness a magpie veering aboutA magpie like a weathercock in doubt
