
If thou must love me let it be for nought Except for loves sake only  Do not say I love her for her smile     her look     her way Of speaking gently     for a trick of thought That falls in well with mine and certes brought A sense of pleasant ease on such a day  For these things in themselves Belovèd may Be changed or change for thee and love so wrought May be unwrought so  Neither love me for Thine own dear pitys wiping my cheeks dry  A creature might forget to weep who bore Thy comfort long and lose thy love thereby But love me for loves sake that evermore Thou mayst love on through loves eternity
