

The girl on the Bullard overpass
looks happy to be there getting soaked
in a light rain but waving her hands
to the four oclock freeway traffic
in which Im anything but happy 
You might think shes too dumb
to come in out of the rain but rain
or shine it doesnt seem to matter 
Shes there most every afternoon
as if she does this for a living 
Some living Id say  Doesnt she ever
get bored or wish someone would stop
and say Where to and her life would change
Thats how Id be hating the noise
the stink of exhaust the press of people 
I cant imagine what her life is
mine is confused and often fretful 
But theres something brave about standing alone
in the rain waving wild semaphores
of gladness to impatient passersby
too tired or preoccupied to care 
Seeing her at her familiar station
I suddenly grin like a fool wave back
and forgive the driver to my right
who is sullen and staring as I pass 
I find her in my rear-view mirror
then head for a needed drink and supper 
I dont know where she goes but I hope
its to a place she loves  I hope the rain
lets up  I hope shes there tomorrow
