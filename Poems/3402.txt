
To the piano of ragtime music
Paul Newman plunges his head
into a basin of ice and water 
A consummate conman with Robert Redford
hes up and ready to take on the Mafia The Sting is on 
Hollywood redresses the wrongs of the world 
From my proscenium seat it is Newmans
awakening into action that catches
my imagination  Cool  So cool 
Outside NAFDEC cinema KiplingsGreat Game rages on 
Yet I am barely away  My basin
of ice cold water is going tepid 
The con of it all 
But to them its jazz  Its all cool
for jazz makes them look cool 
As for ragtime just a last minute
anachronistic improvisation
for good cinemas sake
