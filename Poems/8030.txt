
And now
the horse is entering   
the sea and the sea
                               holds it    
Where are we
Behind us   
the beach
                yes its
scrim
          yes of
                      grass dune sky Desire
goes by and though
it’s wind of course making   
the grass bend
                        unbend we say   
it’s desire again passing
us by souveniring us with   
gospel the grass turned
choir leans into
                           Coming 
Lord soon
