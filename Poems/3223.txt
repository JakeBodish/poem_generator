In his careful welter of dried leaves and seeds
soil samples quartz pebbles notes-to-myself letters
on Dr  Carvers bedside table
next to his pocket watch
folded in Aunt Mariahs Bible
the Bill of Sale 
Seven hundred dollars
for a thirteen-year-old girl named Mary 
He moves it from passage
to favorite passage 
Fifteen cents
for every day she had lived 
Three hundred fifty dollars
for each son 
No charge
for two stillborn daughters
buried out there with the Carvers child 
This new incandescent light makes
his evenings reading unwaveringly easy
if he remembers to wipe his spectacles 
He turns to the blossoming story
of Abrahams dumbstruck luck
of Isaacs pure trust in his fathers wisdom 
Seven hundred dollars for all of her future 
He shakes his head
