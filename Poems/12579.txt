
Memory hither come          And tune your merry notes And while upon the wind          Your music floats  Ill pore upon the stream          Where sighing lovers dream And fish for fancies as they pass          Within the watery glass  Ill drink of the clear stream          And hear the linnets song And there Ill lie and dream          The day along  And when night comes Ill go          To places fit for woe Walking along the darkend valley          With silent Melancholy
