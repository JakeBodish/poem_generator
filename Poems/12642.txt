
Huzza Hodgson we are going
     Our embargos off at lastFavourable breezes blowing
     Bend the canvass oer the mast From aloft the signals streaming
     Hark the farewell gun is firdWomen screeching tars blaspheming
     Tell us that our times expird 
          Heres a rascal
          Come to task all
     Prying from the custom-house
          Trunks unpacking
          Cases cracking
     Not a corner for a mouseScapes unsearchd amid the racketEre we sail on board the Packet Now our boatmen quit their mooring
     And all hands must ply the oarBaggage from the quay is lowering
     Were impatient push from shore Have a care that case holds liquor 
     Stop the boat Im sick oh LordSick maam damme youll be sicker
     Ere youve been an hour on board 
          Thus are screaming
          Men and women
     Gemmen ladies servants Jacks
          Here entangling
          All are wrangling
     Stuck together close as wax  Such the genial noise and racketEre we reach the Lisbon Packet Now weve reachd her lo the captain
     Gallant Kidd commands the crewPassengers their berths are clapt in
     Some to grumble some to spew Hey day call you that a cabin
     Why t is hardly three feet squareNot enough to stow Queen Mab in 
     Who the deuce can harbour there
          Who sir plenty 
          Nobles twenty
     Did at once my vessel fill 
          Did they Jesus
          How you squeeze us
     Would to God they did so stillThen Id scape the heat and racketOf the good ship Lisbon Packet Fletcher Murray Bob where are you
     Stretchd along the deck like logs Bear a hand you jolly tar you
     Heres a ropes end for the dogs Hobhouse muttering fearful curses
     As the hatchway down he rollsNow his breakfast now his verses
     Vomits forth and damns our souls 
          Heres a stanza
          On Braganza 
     Help A couplet No a cup
          Of warm water 
          Whats the matter
     Zounds my livers coming upI shall not survive the racketOf this brutal Lisbon Packet Now at length were off for Turkey
     Lord knows when we shall come backBreezes foul and tempests murky
     May unship us in a crack But since life at most a jest is
     As philosophers allowStill to laugh by far the best is
     Then laugh on as I do now 
          Laugh at all things
          Great and small things
     Sick or well at sea or shore
          While were quaffing
          Lets have laughing 
     Who the devil cares for more Some good wine and who would lack itEvn on board the Lisbon Packet
