
In the autumn I moved to New York
I recognized her face all over the subway
stations pearls around her throat she poses
for her immigration papers  In 1924 the only
Americans required to carry identity cards
were ethnically Chinese the first photo IDs
red targets on the head of every man woman
child infant movie star  Like pallbearers
they lined up to get their pictures taken full-face
view direct camera gaze no smiles ears showing
in silver gelatin  A rogue’s gallery of Chinese
exclusion  The subway poster doesn’t name
her though it does mention her ethnicity
and the name of the New-York Historical
Society exhibition ExclusionInclusion 
Soon when I felt alone in this city her face
would peer at me from behind seats turnstiles
heads and headphones and I swear she wore
a smile only I could see  Sometimes my face
aligned with hers and we would rush past
the bewildered lives before us hers gone
the year my mother was born and mine
a belt of ghosts trailing after my scent 
In the same aboveground train in the same
city where slain umbrellas travel across
the Hudson River we live and live 
I’ve left my landline so ghosts can’t dial me
at midnight with the hunger of hunters
anymore  I’m so hungry I gnaw at light 
It tunnels from the shadows an exhausting
hope  I know this hunger tormented her too 
It haunted her through her years in L A  Paris
and New York the parties she went to people
she met Paul Robeson Zora Neale Hurston
Langston Hughes Gertrude Stein  It haunts
her expression still on the 6 train Grand
Central station an echo chamber behind
her eyes  But dear universe if I can recognize
her face under this tunnel of endless shadows
against the luminance of all that is extinct
and oncoming then I am not a stranger here
