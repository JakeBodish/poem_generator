
I language want to dress my fancies in The hairs uncurled the garments loose and thin Had they but silver lace to make them gayTheyd be more courted than in poor array Or had they art would make a better showBut they are plain yet cleanly do they go The world in bravery doth take delightAnd glistering shows do more attract the sight And every one doth honor a rich hoodAs if the outside made the inside good And every one doth bow and give the place Not for the mans sake but the silver lace Let me intreat in my poor books behalfThat all will not adore the golden calf Consider pray gold hath no life thereinAnd life in nature is the richest thing Be just let Fancy have the upper placeAnd then my verses may perchance find grace
