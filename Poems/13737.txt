
My sons been learning time big hand and little powers of sixty and of twenty-four the slow semaphore of days  Hes brought home paper plates from kindergarten arrows pointing at his favorite hours  So far the face of every clock has smiled  And before we read to sleep each night he crosses off another square on the calendar above his bed counting down to Christmas or to nothing in particular sometimes just a line he draws uphill or down check marks like the ones his teacher leaves on sheets hes filled with capitals and lower cases other times a pair of thick lines like the crossed bones on a pirates flag an X as if to mark the treasure buried in some ordinary week no day yet a cross to bear
