 Chinese Proverb



The body was one thing we always had
in common even when between us
a continent unfolded  Eric saysWe scattered his ashes beneath the Japanese maplehere behind the house  No ceremony
as you wished but this   
What you wanted from me was complex
and simple both  Once you asked for more
than I had to give  I live
with this call it regret  Your hands bloom
in the intaglioed scrawl creased onion skin tattooed
with garnet stamps from Pietrasanta
a sifting of marble dust   Images chiseled
jut of jaw cheek bridge of nose recall
each granite face rising from New Hampshire
dirt upon which faltering you last stepped 
In 1729 long before either of us came
to be Reiner Ottens dragged his fine tip
across a smooth sheet Globi Coelestisin Tabulas Planas Redacti Pars III  Bright beings 
lobster serpent bison dove bearing the requisite
sprig swirl and writhe over lines that pin
distance and story to time 
Spectral creatures that we are connecting dots
to chart our ways    If only I could wrap
the whole plane back into its ball 
Without your body in it
this worlds gone
