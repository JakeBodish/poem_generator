
I wonder about the trees Why do we wish to bearForever the noise of theseMore than another noiseSo close to our dwelling placeWe suffer them by the dayTill we lose all measure of paceAnd fixity in our joysAnd acquire a listening air They are that that talks of goingBut never gets awayAnd that talks no less for knowingAs it grows wiser and olderThat now it means to stay My feet tug at the floorAnd my head sways to my shoulderSometimes when I watch trees swayFrom the window or the door I shall set forth for somewhereI shall make the reckless choiceSome day when they are in voiceAnd tossing so as to scareThe white clouds over them on I shall have less to sayBut I shall be gone
