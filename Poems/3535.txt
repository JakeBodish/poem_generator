
Bungle is the password
A slight matter of a deposit
secures you the nights
blank face on the large
crude banknote
I offer all the grease
thats ever been on my
palm as advice
Dont breathe in
the lights of evening
Moonshine hits the can
bounces off and
consumes the drapes
Im talking about here
where we meet at
the emergency water supply
One man and one
woman gets you
one of each
and some shadows
A caress in the breeze
A caress please so much
You cant even die without
touching you cant
sweeten the fat street
of faces
                without touch
I dont retain the melody
that set me dressed
as I am in motion
in marriage with myself
It aint no honeymoon
to take off my breast
and play it
So it happens you
notice me in my
canary shorts and
my crimson fez
Twunk twunkity twunk
My thumb piano my 
very open eyes
