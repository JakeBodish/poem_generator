
What a surprise it is to hear
that locusts come the thirteenth year
and not the seventeenth as told
for ages and enshrined in old
folklore and rhymes and family lies 
The species similar otherwise
cicadas books call periodic
found here in our southern district 
They grow from eggs pressed into twigs 
The nymphs that hatch then start to dig
at least ten inches into soil
and live by sucking juicy oil
from roots and stems sweet sap
that nourishes through the giant nap
and then the lucky thirteenth year
they grow a polished armor
and crawl into the summer air
and louder than a Mahler choir
fill meadow hedge and orchard grove
with necessary calls for love
then leave their eggs to fortunes whim
with Philip Glass-like requiem
