
Once a man named a thing beautiful  so we wore it
buried it turned it into currency  Somewhere maybe here maybe now
I stand completely still until he looks in my direction  Sometimes I don’t
believe I exist until someone calls me beautiful  Sometimes
any warm thing will do  Sometimes it’s me a warm thing in the low
light  Beautiful is what the man called me after he did
what he wanted with   I’m running out of ways to describe it
   my body my silence  Beautiful  Why I ask in order to love
yourself must you first be loved A bone sucked clean
of its marrow  A trail of ants magnified into ash   of course
I’m asking no one   of course I know the answer 
Of course I know it’s not me they’re looking for the men I mean 
 I wished he didn’t feel the need to speak really wished   like me
   he just kept quiet but no he had to speak he had to say beautiful   
 now goddamnit my body appears trapped in the long tunnel
of a telescope   now I am here attending the aftermath
of my own ruin with nothing but beautiful to keep me company 
Maybe he meant the city beyond the window 
Maybe he was talking to himself  Maybe beautiful as in good job
as in look what I just did with my own two hands
