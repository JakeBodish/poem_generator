
Pale gold and crumbling with crust mottled dark almost bronze pieces of honeycomb lie on a plate  Flecked with the pale paper of hive their hexagonal cells leak into the deepening pool of amber  On your lips against palate tooth and tongue the viscous sugar squeezes from its chambers sears sweetness into your throat until you chew pulp and wax from a blue city of bees  Between your teeth is the blown flower and the flowers seed  Passport pages stamped and turning  Deaths officious hum  Both the candle and its anther of flame  Your own yellow hunger  Never say you cant take this world into your mouth
