
Born again on a Monday
under a broken zodiac 
 
My father the woodman a surgeon among snags
could read the living trail of blades rebounding
in the field the mopped-matte passage through the dew 
 
He woke a brush pile with fire
throwing shadows on the child I was
thrown over 
 
Father it was a pleasure to meet you
on this luminous route between two lives 
 
In this impromptu pool reaped from rain
where mosquitos multiply 
 
Though survival I’m told is impersonal
and without teleological purpose 
Malaria is just trying to maximize its own fitness
 
as are the corporations who for palm oil set
the peatlands ablaze and drained the water table 
 
 
Dense haze from the sea
     choked the light from day
 
           suffused our mountain
in a numinous red corona 
And as for the getting over
 
there will be no ascension
no circumambulation
there is only going through 
 
We must go through it
