
At one friends home whole arsenals of guns
litter the lawn bright plastic shapes my sons
pick their ways between to take proffered
popsicles  Later on evening news words
like ambush  strike and friendly fire
punctuate glowing clips of wreckage in far
fields where other mothers children kneel to
aim and pray  And though its clichéd truth
be told I wish one could keep her boys
from growing old and going off to die  Toys
need not rush us there  Instinct No harm
An urge to hoist whatevers there hard-
wired within Perhaps ignoble Im still glad
when one spits on his own Theyre bad
