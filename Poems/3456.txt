
The fellow talking to himself is me
Though I dont know it  Thats to say I see
Him every morning shave and comb his hair
And then lose track of him until he starts to care
Inflating sex dolls out of thin air
In front of his computer in a battered leather chair
That needs to be thrown out       then I lose track
Until he strides along the sidewalk on the attack
With racist sexist outbursts  What a treat
This guy is glaring at strangers in the street
Completely crazy but not at all insane 
Hes hot but theres frostbite in his brain 
Hes hot but freezing cold and oh so cool 
Hes been called a marvelously elegant ghoul 
 
But with a torn rotator cuff even an elegant fawn
Has to go through shoulder seizures to get his jacket on 
He manages spastically  His left shoulders gone 
It means in pain hes drastically awake at dawn 
A friend of his with pancreatic cancer who will die
Is not in pain so far and she will try
To palliate her death is what her life is now 
The fellows thinking to himself Yes but how
Riding a motorcycle very fast is one way to 
The moon and stars rapidly enter you
While you excrete the sun  You ride across the earth
Looking for a place to lay the eggs of your rebirth 
The eggs crack open and out comes everyone 
The chicks chirp and its begun and its fun 
 
You keep on writing till you write yourself away
And even after when youre nothing you still stay 
The eggs crack open and out comes everyone 
The chicks chirp the poems speak and its again begun
Speaking of someone else for a change not me
There was that time in Stockholm when so strangely
Outside a restaurant in blinding daylight a tiny bird
Circled forever around us and then without a word
Lightly lightly landed on my head and settled there
And you burst into tears  I was unaware
That ten years before the same thing had happened just
After your young daughter died and now it must
Have been Maria come back from the dead a second time to speak
And receive the recognition we all seek
