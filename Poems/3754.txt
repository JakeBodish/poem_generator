
I woke from a bird hitting the window almost I thought hard
enough to break it 
                                   The sun rose knowingly 
                                                                                 I slid the sash up and
stuck my head out like someone in an Italian movie 
                                                                                                 A flicker lay
on its back stunned but it was blinking steady as a railroad
crossing 
                 Was there misery to put out
                                                                      Would it come to its
senses
                  I thought where were you when bark beetles killed half
my trees
                 Then I remembered sleepily reading that flickers mostly
eat ants 
                I went back to sleep for half an hour and dreamed as I
often do of horses 
                                   When next I looked the bird still lay still still
blinking 
                Maybe I thought it cant roll over 
                                                                                So I went down and
rolled it over 
                         Terrified by my touch it came to life and flop-
hopped down the hill into some sagebrush 
                                                                               It didnt fly but it
didnt seem broken either 
                                                  I tried to find it later 
                                                                                          No luck 
                                                                                                          Whether
it lived and flew off or died thrust into a bush was apparently
none of my business 
                                       If it were thrust into a bush I knew the ants
wouldnt wait for the guest of honor to start dinner
