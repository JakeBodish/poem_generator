
I envied the dog lying in the yard
so I did it  But there was a pebble
under my flank so I got up and looked
for the pebble brushed it away
and lay back down  My dog thus far
overlooked the pebble  I guess its her thick
Lab fur  With my head downhill the blood gorged
me with ideas  Not good  Got up  Turned around  Now I
see hundreds of infinitesimal ants  Im on an
ant home  I get up and move five feet 
The dog hasnt moved from her serene place 
Now Im rather too near a thicket where
I saw a big black snake last week that might decide
to join me  I moved near the actual dog this time
but she got up and went under the porch  She doesnt like
it when Im acting weird  Im failing as a dog
when my own kind rejects me but doing better
than when I envied birds the creature the least
like us therefore utterly enviable  To be sure
I cheeped a lot but didnt try to fly 
We humans can take off but are no good at landing
