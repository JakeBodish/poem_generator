
JOHN F  KENNEDY’S INFORMAL APPOINTMENT OF DEAN MARTIN TO HIS CABINET 
   
            What the fuck did they want these men who needed the
            company of others to make a life as he needed a woman
            to make babies                                     Dino nick tosches
                            I always plays to de common folk 
                                         dean martin
                                                      1
It was casting time for The Young Lions 
Brando wouldn’t hesitate given this chance to dye
his hair white and do a German
accent  And while no one would hire Monty Clift
after his facially disfiguring car-wreck
Brando convinced the studio that the other slightly
older kid from Omaha was the right man 
No one could play a more sensitive-tough than Monty
like the artist-bugler-boxer Prewitt
mistaken for the enemy gunned down
by his own men in the Pearl Harbor dawn
or the way as the seraphic cowboy Matt Dunson
he got a rise out of his demented empire builder
father John Wayne by kicking over a tin cup
sloshing the coffee into the dust to show his disgust 
Clift knew that Lions director Edward Dmytryk
was searching for someone to play a key
supporting role as Frank Sinatra had in From Here ToEternity yet he was stunned to hear it was
“Jerry Lewis’s partner in shlock ”
Clift softened nauseated when he saw
Martin’s competition
pander to the crowd on Broadway 
Lucky for Monty that he let it go the two men
not only became friends it was Dean
who put the man with the wired-jaw to bed
when he had the chloral hydrate and alcohol wobblies 
Ignorant of Brando’s intervention on his behalf
Monty told Dean that Marlon’s fifty takes per scene
were getting on his nerves more and more
and he vowed to walk off the set if he tried
ONE MORE TIME to have his German soldier die
with arms spread wide to “echo the crucifixion ”
Clift wasted with self-recrimination at forty-five 
Martin an actor for whom one run through a scene
almost always sufficed 
Dean got a chuckle out of Monty with his response 
“It should be awful good with so many takes ”
Then the future flashed before him 
“I guess there are directors who want us to do
the same scene over and over again too ”
“Sure lots  Some of the best ”
“I guess I got spoiled  Jerry and I got
to where we pretty much called the shots ”
And then without any foreknowledge
that he’d be doing his only two other
serious roles in the next two years
and be subject to directorial rule on the sets ofSome Came Running and Rio Bravo 
he vowed in the future to set up his golf net
before shooting started on a picture 
Dean appeared to float perfection
never an aspiration that he was already as well known
for his insouciance and drunk persona as for
his singing and acting doesn’t mean he was so well-defended
that he didn’t feel any pressure about working
with such aces as Brando and Clift 
He didn’t have to stretch to play a would-be draft dodger
Michael Whiteacre “a likeable coward like myself”
a screenwriter in Shaw’s novel a singer in the movie 
The army doctor feeds Dean his first line in Lions
as if his future were visible in the instant
art and life exquisitely commingled 
Doctor “For a man your age and in your profession
you’re in excellent health  How do you manage it”
Martin doesn’t hesitate “Clean liquor ”
But sauntering through this role didn’t mean
everything was swell he felt so out-of-place
on location in France he gave up the offer of
a choice part in The Guns of Navarone
because it meant going back to Europe 
In his middle years he ambled through the role
of “Matt Helm” in another toneless
Bondian takeoff and when Columbia
wanted to shoot Murderers’ Row
on location in Cannes Dino
set the studio straight “fuck no
just build some fake Riviera sets ”
                                                      2
A diffident crooner he needed a stooge 
License to fuck around on stage 
After his split with Jerry Dino’s drunk persona grew
into a ghostly partner and by the time he had his own TV show
the public was so saturated with his presence
many conflated the persona and the person 
When he landed the drunk’s key role in Rio Bravo
he turned to Brando for help “what should I do”
Brando told him what to think about 
The more inscrutable the subject
the more this spectre stands out in relief 
Part of Martin’s appeal was that no one knew him 
It wasn’t a mask his detachment was who he was 
He showed up his spirit remained elsewhere 
His wives and children found him unknowable 
It wasn’t personal  When the Martins entertained
the guests carried on while Dino disappeared
into his room to watch westerns on TV alone 
It wasn’t personal  When the producer of
“The Colgate Comedy Hour” suggested they have lunch
to get to know one another Dino
set him straight “No one gets to know me ”
Martin was a man no one came close to knowing 
What does it mean to know someone
                                                      3
Why ask such questions at all after Socrates
beguiled us out of answers and set us on
the inexhaustible path   dialectics
Don’t you think I haven’t wondered if I haven’t
strayed from my true path as I find myself
tracking the trajectory of such non-exemplary lives
You’re thinking it’s a trick and will not answer
but before you judge my dissolute subject 
who like the money but thought all the attention
was a joke because “a singer is nothing” 
as a derelict choice consider how philosophy
while striving to become more concrete
continues to recoil before the problem of other minds 
And it is said that Monsieur Sartre turned paler
than his martini when Raymond Aron
challenged the Husserlians at the Bec de Gaz
in Montparnasse to make philosophy
out of a cocktail glass 
                                                      4
There’s something about everyone no one can know 
There was no question of Dino taking orders
and being bossed around was out of bounds
penalty shot incurred for the perpetrator
who was this time the imperious Billy Wilder
whose streak of hits was breaking fast 
Dino as always was doing his job
which was to literally play himself in Kiss Me
Stupid
