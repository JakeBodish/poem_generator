
A drain spout splashing
rusty stains on concrete
 
the taste of doorknobs
you kiss before squinting
 
through the musty keyhole
at the knife-sharpener’s daughter
 
while across the city
the knife-sharpener
 
limps his pushcart
with its dinging axles
 
with its screeching whetstone
up wet alleys
 
crying scissors knives axes
