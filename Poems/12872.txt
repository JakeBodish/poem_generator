While you great patron of mankind sustain The balancd world and open all the main Your country chief in arms abroad defend At home with morals arts and laws amend How shall the Muse from such a monarch steal An hour and not defraud the public weal        Edward and Henry now the boast of fame And virtuous Alfred a more sacred name After a life of genrous toils endurd The Gaul subdud or property securd Ambition humbled mighty cities stormd Or laws establishd and the world reformd Closd their long glories with a sigh to find Th unwilling gratitude of base mankind All human virtue to its latest breath Finds envy never conquerd but by death  The great Alcides evry labour past Had still this monster to subdue at last  Sure fate of all beneath whose rising ray Each star of meaner merit fades away Oppressd we feel the beam directly beat Those suns of glory please not till they set         To thee the world its present homage pays The harvest early but mature the praise Great friend of liberty in kings a name Above all Greek above all Roman fame Whose word is truth as sacred and reverd As Heavns own oracles from altars heard  Wonder of kings like whom to mortal eyes None eer has risen and none eer shall rise         Just in one instance be it yet confest Your people Sir are partial in the rest Foes to all living worth except your own And advocates for folly dead and gone  Authors like coins grow dear as they grow old It is the rust we value not the gold  Chaucers worst ribaldry is learnd by rote And beastly Skelton heads of houses quote One likes no language but the  Faery Queen  A Scot will fight for Christs Kirk o the Green And each true Briton is to Ben so civil He swears the Muses met him at the Devil         Though justly Greece her eldest sons admires Why should not we be wiser than our sires In evry public virtue we excel We build we paint we sing we dance as well And learned Athens to our art must stoop Could she behold us tumbling through a hoop         If time improve our wit as well as wine Say at what age a poet grows divine Shall we or shall we not account him so Who died perhaps an hundred years ago End all dispute and fix the year precise When British bards begin timmortalize        Who lasts a century can have no flaw I hold that wit a classic good in law         Suppose he wants a year will you compound And shall we deem him ancient right and sound Or damn to all eternity at once At ninety-nine a modern and a dunce        We shall not quarrel for a year or two By courtesy of England he may do         Then by the rule that made the horsetail bare I pluck out year by year as hair by hair And melt down ancients like a heap of snow While you to measure merits look in Stowe And estimating authors by the year Bestow a garland only on a bier         Shakespeare whom you and evry playhouse bill Style the divine the matchless what you will For gain not glory wingd his roving flight And grew immortal in his own despite  Ben old and poor as little seemd to heed The life to come in evry poets creed  Who now reads Cowley if he pleases yet His moral pleases not his pointed wit Forgot his epic nay Pindaric art But still I love the language of his heart         Yet surely surely these were famous men What boy but hears the sayings of old Ben In all debates where critics bear a part Not one but nods and talks of Jonsons art Of Shakespeares nature and of Cowleys wit How Beaumonts judgment checkd what Fletcher writ How Shadwell hasty Wycherley was slow But for the passions Southerne sure and Rowe  These only these support the crowded stage From eldest Heywood down to Cibbers age         All this may be the peoples voice is odd It is and it is not the voice of God  To  Gammer Gurton if it give the bays And yet deny the  Careless Husband praise Or say our fathers never broke a rule Why then I say the public is a fool  But let them own that greater faults than we They had and greater virtues Ill agree  Spenser himself affects the obsolete And Sidneys verse halts ill on Roman feet Miltons strong pinion now not Heavn can bound Now serpent-like in prose he sweeps the ground In quibbles angel and archangel join And God the Father turns a school divine  Not that Id lop the beauties from his book Like slashing Bentley with his desprate hook Or damn all Shakespeare like th affected fool At court who hates whateer he read at school         But for the wits of either Charless days The mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease Sprat Carew Sedley and a hundred more Like twinkling stars the  Miscellanies oer One simile that solitary shines In the dry desert of a thousand lines Or lengthend thought that gleams through many a page Has sanctified whole poems for an age         I lose my patience and I own it too When works are censurd not as bad but new While if our elders break all reasons laws These fools demand not pardon but applause         On Avons bank where flowrs eternal blow If I but ask if any weed can grow One tragic sentence if I dare deride Which Bettertons grave action dignified Or well-mouthd Booth with emphasis proclaims Though but perhaps a muster-roll of names How will our fathers rise up in a rage And swear all shame is lost in Georges age Youd think no fools disgracd the former reign Did not some grave examples yet remain Who scorn a lad should teach his father skill And having once been wrong will be so still  He who to seem more deep than you or I Extols old bards or Merlins Prophecy Mistake him not he envies not admires And to debase the sons exalts the sires  Had ancient times conspird to disallow What then was new what had been ancient now Or what remaind so worthy to be read By learned critics of the mighty dead        In days of ease when now the weary sword Was sheathd and luxury with Charles restord In evry taste of foreign courts improvd All by the Kings example livd and lovd  Then peers grew proud in horsemanship texcel Newmarkets glory rose as Britains fell The soldier breathd the gallantries of France And evry flowry courtier writ romance  Then marble softend into life grew warm And yielding metal flowd to human form Lely on animated canvas stole The sleepy eye that spoke the melting soul  No wonder then when all was love and sport The willing Muses were debauchd at court On each enervate string they taught the note To pant or tremble through an eunuchs throat  But Britain changeful as a child at play Now calls in princes and now turns away Now Whig now Tory what we lovd we hate Now all for pleasure now for Church and state Now for prerogative and now for laws Effects unhappy from a noble cause         Time was a sober Englishman would knock His servants up and rise by five oclock Instruct his family in evry rule And send his wife to church his son to school  To worship like his fathers was his care To teach their frugal virtues to his heir To prove that luxury could never hold And place on good security his gold  Now times are changd and one poetic itch Has seizd the court and city poor and rich Sons sires and grandsires all will wear the bays Our wives read Milton and our daughters plays To theatres and to rehearsals throng And all our grace at table is a song  I who so oft renounce the Muses lie Not -----s self eer tells more fibs than I When sick of Muse our follies we deplore And promise our best friends to rhyme no more We wake next morning in a raging fit And call for pen and ink to show our wit         He servd a prenticeship who sets up shop Ward tried on puppies and the poor his drop Evn Radcliffes doctors travel first to France Nor dare to practise till theyve learnd to dance  Who builds a bridge that never drove a pile Should Ripley venture all the world would smile But those who cannot write and those who can All rhyme and scrawl and scribble to a man         Yet Sir reflect the mischief is not great These madmen never hurt the Church or state Sometimes the folly benefits mankind And rarely avrice taints the tuneful mind  Allow him but his plaything of a pen He neer rebels or plots like other men Flight of cashiers or mobs hell never mind And knows no losses while the Muse is kind  To cheat a friend or ward he leaves to Peter The good man heaps up nothing but mere metre Enjoys his garden and his book in quiet And then a perfect hermit in his diet  Of little use the man you may suppose Who says in verse what others say in prose Yet let me show a poets of some weight And though no soldier useful to the state  What will a child learn sooner than a song What better teach a foreigner the tongue Whats long or short each accent where to place And speak in public with some sort of grace  I scarce can think him such a worthless thing Unless he praise some monster of a king Or virtue or religion turn to sport To please a lewd or unbelieving court  Unhappy Dryden In all Charless days Roscommon only boasts unspotted bays And in our own excuse some courtly stains No whiter page than Addison remains  He from the taste obscene reclaims our youth And sets the passions on the side of truth Forms the soft bosom with the gentlest art And pours each human virtue in the heart  Let Ireland tell how wit upheld her cause Her trade supported and supplied her laws And leave on Swift this grateful verse engravd The rights a court attackd a poet savd  Behold the hand that wrought a nations cure Stretchd to relieve the idiot and the poor Proud vice to brand or injurd worth adorn And stretch the ray to ages yet unborn  Not but there are who merit other palms Hopkins and Sternhold glad the heart with psalms The boys and girls whom charity maintains Implore your help in these pathetic strains How could devotion touch the country pews Unless the gods bestowd a proper Muse Verse cheers their leisure verse assists their work Verse prays for peace or sings down Pope and Turk  The silencd preacher yields to potent strain And feels that grace his prayr besought in vain The blessing thrills through all the labring throng And Heavn is won by violence of song         Our rural ancestors with little blest Patient of labour when the end was rest Indulgd the day that housd their annual grain With feasts and offrings and a thankful strain The joy their wives their sons and servants share Ease of their toil and partners of their care The laugh the jest attendants on the bowl Smoothd evry brow and opend evry soul With growing years the pleasing licence grew And taunts alternate innocently flew  But times corrupt and nature ill-inclind Producd the point that left a sting behind Till friend with friend and families at strife Triumphant malice ragd through private life  Who felt the wrong or feard it took th alarm Appeald to law and justice lent her arm  At length by wholesome dread of statutes bound The poets learnd to please and not to wound Most warpd to flattrys side but some more nice Preservd the freedom and forbore the vice  Hence satire rose that just the medium hit And heals with morals what it hurts with wit         We conquerd France but felt our captives charms Her arts victorious triumphd oer our arms Britain to soft refinements less a foe Wit grew polite and numbers learnd to flow  Waller was smooth but Dryden taught to join The varying verse the full-resounding line The long majestic march and energy divine  Though still some traces of our rustic vein And splayfoot verse remaind and will remain  Late very late correctness grew our care When the tird nation breathd from civil war  Exact Racine and Corneilles noble fire Showd us that France had something to admire  Not but the tragic spirit was our own And full in Shakespeare fair in Otway shone But Otway faild to polish or refine And fluent Shakespeare scarce effacd a line  Evn copious Dryden wanted or forgot The last and greatest art the art to blot         Some doubt if equal pains or equal fire The humbler Muse of comedy require  But in known images of life I guess The labour greater as th indulgence less  Observe how seldom evn the best succeed Tell me if Congreves fools are fools indeed What pert low dialogue has Farquar writ How Van wants grace who never wanted wit The stage how loosely does Astraeea tread Who fairly puts all characters to bed And idle Cibber how he breaks the laws To make poor Pinky eat with vast applause But fill their purse our poets work is done Alike to them by pathos or by pun         O you whom vanitys light bark conveys On fames mad voyage by the wind of praise With what a shifting gale your course you ply For ever sunk too low or borne too high Who pants for glory finds but short repose A breath revives him or a breath oerthrows  Farewell the stage if just as thrives the play The silly bard grows fat or falls away         There still remains to mortify a wit The many-headed monster of the pit A senseless worthless and unhonourd crowd Who to disturb their betters mighty proud Clattring their sticks before ten lines are spoke Call for the farce the bear or the black-joke  What dear delight to Britons farce affords Farce once the taste of mobs but now of lords For taste eternal wanderer now flies From heads to ears and now from ears to eyes  The play stands still damn action and discourse Back fly the scenes and enter foot and horse Pageants on pageants in long order drawn Peers heralds bishops ermine gold and lawn The champion too and to complete the jest Old Edwards armour beams on Cibbers breast  With laughter sure Democritus had died Had he beheld an audience gape so wide  Let bear or elephant be eer so white The people sure the people are the sight Ah luckless poet stretch thy lungs and roar That bear or elephant shall heed thee more While all its throats the gallery extends And all the thunder of the pit ascends Loud as the wolves on Orcas stormy steep Howl to the roarings of the Northern deep  Such is the shout the long-applauding note At Quins high plume or Oldfields petticoat Or when from Court a birthday suit bestowd Sinks the lost actor in the tawdry load  Booth enters hark the universal peal But has he spoken Not a syllable  What shook the stage and made the people stare Catos long wig flowrd gown and lacquerd chair         Yet lest you think I rally more than teach Or praise malignly arts I cannot reach Let me for once presume tinstruct the times To know the poet from the man of rhymes Tis he who gives my breast a thousand pains Can make me feel each passion that he feigns Enrage compose with more than magic art With pity and with terror tear my heart And snatch me oer the earth or thro the air To Thebes to Athens when he will and where         But not this part of the poetic state Alone deserves the favour of the great Think of those authors Sir who would rely More on a readers sense than gazers eye  Or who shall wander where the Muses sing Who climb their mountain or who taste their spring How shall we fill a library with wit When Merlins Cave is half unfurnishd yet        My Liege why writers little claim your thought I guess and with their leave will tell the fault We poets are upon a poets word Of all mankind the creatures most absurd The season when to come and when to go To sing or cease to sing we never know And if we will recite nine hours in ten You lose your patience just like other men  Then too we hurt ourselves when to defend A single verse we quarrel with a friend Repeat unaskd lament the wits too fine For vulgar eyes and point out evry line  But most when straining with too weak a wing We needs will write epistles to the king And from the moment we oblige the town Expect a place or pension from the Crown Or dubbd historians by express command Tenroll your triumphs oer the seas and land Be calld to court to plan some work divine As once for Louis Boileau and Racine         Yet think great Sir so many virtues shown Ah think what poet best may make them known Or choose at least some minister of grace Fit to bestow the laureates weighty place         Charles to late times to be transmitted fair Assignd his figure to Berninis care And great Nassau to Knellers hand decreed To fix him graceful on the bounding steed So well in paint and stone they judgd of merit But kings in wit may want discerning spirit  The hero William and the martyr Charles One knighted Blackmore and one pensiond Quarles Which made old Ben and surly Dennis swear No Lords anointed but a Russian bear         Not with such majesty such bold relief The forms august of king or conquring chief Eer swelld on marble as in verse have shind In polishd verse the manners and the mind  Oh could I mount on the Maeonian wing Your arms your actions your repose to sing What seas you traversd and what fields you fought Your countrys peace how oft how dearly bought How barbrous rage subsided at your word And nations wonderd while they droppd the sword How when you nodded oer the land and deep Peace stole her wing and wrappd the world in sleep Till earths extremes your mediation own And Asias tyrants tremble at your throne  But verse alas your Majesty disdains And Im not usd to panegyric strains The zeal of fools offends at any time But most of all the zeal of fools in rhyme Besides a fate attends on all I write That when I aim at praise they say I bite  A vile encomium doubly ridicules Theres nothing blackens like the ink of fools If true a woeful likeness and if lies Praise undeservd is scandal in disguise  Well may he blush who gives it or receives And when I flatter let my dirty leaves Like journals odes and such forgotten things As Eusden Philips Settle writ of kings Clothe spice line trunks or fluttring in a row Befringe the rails of Bedlam and Soho
