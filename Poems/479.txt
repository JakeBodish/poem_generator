
The dissonance of women  The shrill frilly silly
drippy prissy pouty fuss of us  And all the while
science was the music of our minds  Our sexual
identities glittery as tinsel we fretted about gods
difficulties with intimacy waiting for days luster
to fade so we could slip into something less
venerated  Like sea anemones at high tide
our minds snatched at whatever rushed by 
Hush hush my love  These things happened
a long time ago  You neednt be afraid of them now
