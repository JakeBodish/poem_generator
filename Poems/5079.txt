
Here where the rooms are dryly stillWho is this dustily asleepWhile juicy children run the fieldWhere is her ever deepening wellWhose buckets to a fullness dipFor needs compassion must fulfillLike freshets they themselves may yieldA little to the turned up cupBut death is in the long dry spell Run children run the light grows dullAnd she who keeps the well must sleepAnd rain is unpredictable December 1951
