
Perhaps is a new and sudden way of being 
 
Like satisfaction not yet begun or some other kind
of kindness
 
a more gentle one
 
Night makes us all into the middle
of something until we arent
 
anything anymore  The sky
isnt any color here  Its OK
because consolation is color enough
 
for your cheeks wind bitten and glorified
by the light of the wine in this glass draining
 
toward a better time a better space  I invented
a notion of hell and you invented a notion of hello 
 
Amazing similarities and bizarrely coincidental snow
 
Like a twig falling from an oaks tallest point
 
I keep wondering when forgiveness
found its way into this world
 
in a time before bargaining and beckoning 
 
Its quiet again and now the sky is a tangled
mess of rags seeking out the bored and unwilling 
 
Id like to make a map not of the land
but of the path I took to arrive in this place
 
a map with no idealized purpose
a map of a thousand airless pines
