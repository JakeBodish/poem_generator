
Well then the promisd hour is come at lastThe present age of wit obscures the pastStrong were our sires and as they fought they writConquring with force of arms and dint of witTheirs was the giant race before the FloodAnd thus when Charles returnd our empire stood Like Janus he the stubborn soil manurdWith rules of husbandry the rankness curdTamd us to manners when the stage was rudeAnd boisterous English wit with art endud Our age was cultivated thus at lengthBut what we gained in skill we lost in strength Our builders were with want of genius curstThe second temple was not like the firstTill you the best Vitruvius come at lengthOur beauties equal but excel our strength Firm Doric pillars found your solid baseThe fair Corinthian crowns the higher spaceThus all below is strength and all above is grace In easy dialogue is Fletchers praiseHe movd the mind but had not power to raise Great Jonson did by strength of judgment pleaseYet doubling Fletchers force he wants his ease In differing talents both adornd their ageOne for the study tother for the stage But both to Congreve justly shall submitOne matchd in judgment both oer-matchd in wit In him all beauties of this age we seeEthereges courtship Southerns purityThe satire wit and strength of manly Wycherly All this in blooming youth you have achievdNor are your foild contemporaries grievdSo much the sweetness of your manners moveWe cannot envy you because we love Fabius might joy in Scipio when he sawA beardless Consul made against the lawAnd join his suffrage to the votes of RomeThough he with Hannibal was overcome Thus old Romano bowd to Raphaels fameAnd scholar to the youth he taught became 
     Oh that your brows my laurel had sustaindWell had I been deposd if you had reigndThe father had descended for the sonFor only you are lineal to the throne Thus when the State one Edward did deposeA greater Edward in his room arose But now not I but poetry is cursdFor Tom the second reigns like Tom the first But let em not mistake my patrons partNor call his charity their own desert Yet this I prophesy thou shalt be seenTho with some short parenthesis betweenHigh on the throne of wit and seated thereNot mine thats little but thy laurel wear Thy first attempt an early promise madeThat early promise this has more than paid So bold yet so judiciously you dareThat your least praise is to be regular Time place and action may with pains be wroughtBut genius must be born and never can be taught This is your portion this your native storeHeavn that but once was prodigal beforeTo Shakespeare gave as much she could not give him more 
     Maintain your post thats all the fame you needFor tis impossible you should proceed Already I am worn with cares and ageAnd just abandoning th ungrateful stageUnprofitably kept at Heavns expenseI live a rent-charge on his providenceBut you whom evry muse and grace adornWhom I foresee to better fortune bornBe kind to my remains and oh defendAgainst your judgment your departed friendLet not the insulting foe my fame pursueBut shade those laurels which descend to youAnd take for tribute what these lines expressYou merit more nor could my love do less
