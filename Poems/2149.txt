
I go to the corner liquor store for a bottle of water middle of a hectic day must get out of the office stop making decisions quit obsessing does my blue skirt clash with my hot pink flats should I get my mother a caregiver or just put her in a home and I pull open the glass refrigerator door am confrontedby brands Arrowhead Glitter Geyser Deer Park spring summer winter water and clearly the bosses of bottled water Real Water and Smart Water how different will they taste If I drink Smart Waterwill I raise my IQ but be less authentic If I choose Real Water will I no longer deny the truth but will I attract confused needy people who’ll take advantageof my realness by dumping their problems on me and will I be too stupid to help them sort through their murky dilemmas I take no chances buy them bothsparkling smart purified real drain both bottles look around to see is anyone watching I’m now brilliantly hydrated Both real and smart my insides bubblewith compassion and intelligenceas I walk the streets with a new swaggerknowing the world is mine
