the woods  Over the river and into the pain  It is an addicts
talk of quitting as shes smacking at a vein  He was always
going into the woods  It was he who wrote The best wayout is always through  Youd think a shrink but no a poet 
He saw the woods and knew  The forest is the one that holds
promises  The woods are lovely dark and deep they fill 
with a quiet snow  Miles are traveled as we sleep  He steershis horse off the road  Among the trees now the blizzard 
is a dusting  Holes in the canopy make columns of snowstorm 
lit from above  His little horse thinks it is queer  They go
deeper sky gets darker  Its the darkest night of the year                                                               IIHe had no promises to keep nothing pending  Had no bedto head to measurably away in miles  He was a freak like memonster of the dawn  Whose woods these are I think I knowhis house is in the village though  In the middle of lifehe found himself lost in a dark woods  I discovered myselfin a somber forest  In between my breasts and breaths I gotlost  The woods are lovely dark and deep  But Ive got promisesto keep smiles to go before I leap  Im going into the woods Theyre lovely dark and deep which is what I want deep lovely darkness  No one has asked let alone taken a promise of meno one will notice if I choose bed or rug couch or forest deep  It doesnt matter where I sleep  It doesnt matter where I sleep
