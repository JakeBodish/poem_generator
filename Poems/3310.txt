La Barraca Blues Suitei 
Beneath canopies of green unionists marched doggedly
outside The Embassy  Their din was no match
for light lancing through leaves of madrone trees
lining the Paseo then flashing off glossy black Maybachs
skidding round a plaza like a monarch fleeing the paparazzi 
Your voice skipped and paused like a pencil 
Layers of morning pastries flaked gingerly
then fell soft as vowels on a china plate  One learns
to cherish the wizened reserve of old world manners
two blotched hands making wings of a daily paper
beside us between sips of café con leche a demeanor
in short gentle as grand edifaces along this boulevard 
Yet Guernica is down the street and some windshields
wear a sinister face sometimes two  Think Goya  Just south
of here on the lower slopes of the Sierras fields
of olive groves braid the land like a Moorish head but
those sultans were kicked out long ago  In the lobby
of the Hotel Urban I wait for a cab my obedient rolling bag
like a pet beside me  I have loved again another city
but Madrid is yours her caped olés her bullish flag
her glass pavilions and outdoor tables like a festival
of unbroken laughter our dark harbors finding level 
ii Salobreña
That stretch of mountains features white windmill
blades whose slow turns are rifles aiming for I cannot
help but think of Lorcas killing between here and the
      village
Alfaçar and the firing squads gun pops are that Flamencan
dancers heel stomps  I bring back too her brisk hand claps
and the cantors Andalusian moans like dried sticks
or bones crumbling in his throat  Only souvenir shops
and steep winding streets accrete in this regions stacked
brochures    Her dress spills across the restaurants floor
like a red shadow darker than billboards of black bulls
high above roadways motionless but seeming to gallop
like Francos brigades  All seeing is an act of war 
Tanks and artillery or Spanish castles and mosques
I choose to lose and beneath a watercolorists sky
study Didis splendor nude against the unruffled backdrop
of the Alboran Sea whose waves match my sighs
and bomb this beach launching sprays of white duds 
iii Córdoba Mezquita
Even if hed pulled over to study Andalusias road signs
after one thousand and one nights he still could
not make out its calligraphic script its vertical lines
its dots marks like smoke stilled from incense its curled
sand soft Arabic but this citys voice has coffins
and carnations and its hoarse singing shoots through him
like twelve bars of earthen road that lengthens
into a labyrinth of knowing blood beneath black skin 
More echoes the Alhambra sent him back to the seraglio
of his youth where a Moorish guard stood in a museum
unfazed by a harems rising laughter behind palace doors 
Here are pillars and banded arches to once again
imagine the body passing through like a key into infinity 
Was this the answer to his ghetto past But why travel
so far Since a child even in sleep he voyaged and broke free
tossing dice in dreams once below deck on a caravel
next to grains of paradise  Hes collecting a thousand faces 
Hes moving beneath eyelids turning time into flesh 
Dont judge him  The courtyards orange trees where once
he washed like a morisco are teaching his tongue the craft
