
It was a life of exile under the trees 
My father came to the stockyards 
My mother from a farm 
In 1952 or 2 my parents flew from Kansas City to Indianapolis
to look for a house when my father was transferred 
I think of them far above me
small as birds when they flew
and the earth to them was a sandbox in our backyard
where I made roads to a house I never found 
I often think of wives in tract houses 
The cows and pigs my father yarded
before they walked up the ramp to the kill 
Sometimes I thought we were together
because of something terrible we had done 
My fathers Cherokee heritage tucked under
some sort of shame  The past 
What was it I call to them above me
no larger than a leaf
