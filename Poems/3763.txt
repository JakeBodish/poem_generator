
The phone call from my wife She’s hungry she’s pregnantsomeone kicked her
 in the stomach we have to  
I say yes but the reply
I keep to myself is
  We don’t have to do a goddamn thing 
A dog  I’m talking about a dog
I would have otherwise left to starve 
 
Now though five years since
I love this animal Lucy
more than I can most people 
 
               •
 
A boy names his dog and five cats
after our Lucy  The boy my brother
born in Henry Ford’s hometown
 
lives now in Lebanon
which the Greeks called Phoenicia
and they tried but failed
 
to subdue it same as the Egyptians
Hittites Assyrians Babylonians
Alexander the Great Romans Arabs
 
Crusaders Turks the British
the French the Israelis 
There my father built a house
 
with money earned in Detroit 
as a grocer with social security 
Also there the first alphabet
 
was created the first law school built
the first miracle of Jesus 
water wine 
 
               •
 
On the first day
the bombs fall they flee
and the boy asks
 
to go back for Lucy
the dog  As for the catsNo  They take care of themselves 
 
One week into it
he wonders who feeds them
who fills the water bowls 
 Maybe the neighbors
the mother thinks out loud 
The father is indignant Neighbors 
 what neighbors They’re gone 
The mother is stunnedWhat do you mean gone 
 
After a month everyone forgets
or just stops talking about
the animals  During the ceasefire
 
my father drives south
a thirty-minute trip that lasts
six hours wreckage upon wreckage
 
piled on the roads on what is left
of the roads  The landscape
entirely gray so catastrophic
 
he asks a passerby how far
to his town and is toldYou’re in it 
 
                •
 
My father finds three of the cats
all perforated one headless 
The dog is near the carport
 
where it hid during lightning storms
its torso splayed in half
like meat on a slab its entrails
 
eaten by other dogs
scavenging on the streets 
Look  They’re animals 
 
Which is to say there are also people 
And I haven’t even begun telling you
what was done to them
