Follow where all is   Follow the transfused   Follow what is still and what is still-attracting That light  That beauty  That love  That that is massy-borne and rising up like a drifting star Like stars lift   Like lifting stars   Like the lifting of stars I rose  I rise  Rose  Rose  Like a thing beyond words satiated Let lie in the ravage   Let lie in what is ravaged-wrought Why fear what hasn’t becomeI beckon like light   Like a star I will beckon   You will oblige   You will lend the want  You will eclipse my blinding  You will know nothing  Nothing  You will know nothing of what has been dark
