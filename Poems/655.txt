
Up on the roof waiting for the fireworks to begin
in warm winter rain a moment ago I stepped
from the elevator into the black air
of an almost New Year
and need a minute to catch my breath
at the spread of city open to my eye 
I cant go to the edge I never could 
The old fear of height still troubles me
the sensation that nothing can be under me
if I am surrounded by mist and rain
and all of the dark night air we breathe 
Even a glimpse at the treetops in the park
with its slick crisscrossing roads that plunge
into the jumbled panorama of East Side Manhattan
hysterical tonight with its own incandescence
gives me the willies  I feel as if
I were standing on the deck of a showboat of a cloud
as it drifts down some dark river waiting for it
to bang into some other buildings fifteenth floor 
How can these old people hunch the railing
hoisting their plastic glasses of champagne
from under dripping umbrellas as if
they drank the rain as they laugh
their analyses of the weather
Maybe now like me they have nothing to lose 
I moved in three weeks ago this is my first trip
to the roof  I dont want to die tonight
the first fatality of 1990 Theres too much of me
I left in pieces last year oh the whole last decade
But Im up here to distract myself temporarily
from what I dont want or cant have
in the way of love        That must be
the Triborough Bridge tied in its strings
of blue lights and I can see in Central Park
the skating rink like a scoured mirror below
where some madman waves a red lantern he
must be drunk  I have only sipped a speck of Drambuie
which I didnt carry in my Coca-Cola glass
up to these festivities  This is the first New Years
Ive spent alone in twenty twenty-two years 
I never could go to the edge but I did 
Out there in the dark my marriage the woman
I loved badly as she did me or none too well
the places we lived the apartment I once half-owned
the thousands of books I had to leave behind
though I am to be granted library privileges
and the black and white cat I really miss 
My wifes with her friends tonight somewhere in Brooklyn
friends of mine out there too though I dont know
where  Its just like me to move in the middle
of a telephone company strike  Thus no calls
from anyone and I dont even have
a telephone yet so who could call Damp but trying
to smile I eye the revelers  Two young men
and their enormous girlfriends have joined us
really large women who carry balloons all ready
to froth in merry champagne  We check
our watches to the screams from swarms
of apartment windows to the west
as the sky lights up with the first furious
bombardment of colored shells  I can see that
red lantern swinging toward the rockets aha
So it wasnt a drunk but the fireworks engineer
preparing to blow the years last sky
to smithereens for our delight
I like to follow the tiny spurts of flame
from the launching pad in their heavenward trajectory
as much as I like the rockets red glare
the bombs bursting in air which give proof
to the night that I am still here hands
jammed in the pockets of my sodden raincoat
face dripping with rain hat soaked wondering
if the skinny guy in the army jacket behind me
who looks just like I did in the sixties
is mumbling his way into a combat flashback
and ready to hurl me over the edge of the roof
and into kingdom come  I guess not yet  Weve
survived the first blasts of spinning green
corkscrews of spangled flame buds of fireballs
spewed in arching gold sprays the whistling fire-fish
that curl and howl as they flare falling to ash 
Screaming its head off the New York New Year enters 
I feel sad that beautiful things must die
even shadows made of smoke and flame
whatever I thought I had made out of my life 
music poems books kisses a little useless fame 
The army guy behind me grumbles at the haze
of rocket smoke that coils around the trees
then tumbles up into the air toward Harlem 
That bump and thud and bump sound everywhere
more clouds smacking each other head-on 
The flashes of the explosions are close enough
to touch if you wanted to burn your fingers
on the sky and the glare rocks our shadows back
against the brick as if chaos snapped
our pictures in the dark  I smile for my portrait
curious at the New Year smelling the acrid smoke
of the one weve just destroyed  Then I squeeze into
the tiny elevator car with the others anonymous
reconciled to be so back to my little apartment
and the waiting glass of amber drink Ill raise
only half in jest to my new life
