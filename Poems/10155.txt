Deflores  Quickly  Beatrice  Oh I never shall speak if yet further of that I may lose What has been spoken and no sound remain ont   would not hear so much offence again for such another deed  Deflores  Soft Lady soft the last is not yet paid for oh this act Has put me into spirit I was as greedy ont As the parcht earth of moisture when the clouds weep  Did you ot mark I wrought my self intot  Nay sued and kneeld fort Why was all that pains took You see I have thrown contempt upon your gold Not that I want it for I doe piteously In order I will come untot and make use ont But twas not held so pretious to begin with For I place wealth after the heels of pleasure And where I not resolvd in my belief That thy virginity were perfect in thee I should but take my recompense with grudging As if I had but halfe my hopes I agreed for  Beatrice  Why tis impossible thou canst be so wicked Or shelter such a cunning cruelty To make his death the murderer of my honor  Thy language is so bold and vitious I cannot see which way I can forgive it with any modesty  Deflores  Push you forget your selfe a woman dipt in blood and talk of modesty  Beatrice  O misery of sin would I had been bound Perpetually unto my living hate In that Piracquo then to hear these words  Think but upon the distance that Creation Set twixt thy blood and mine and keep thee there  Deflores  Look but into your conscience read me there Tis a true Book youl find me there your equall Push flye not to your birth but settle you In what the act has made you yare no more now You must forget your parentage to me Yare the deeds creature by that name You lost your first condition and I challenge you As peace and innocency has turnd you out And made you one with me  Beatrice  With thee foul villain Deflores  Yes my fair murdress Do you urge me Though thou wrist maid thou whore in thy affection Twas changd from thy first love and thats a kind Of whoredome in thy heart and hes changd now To bring thy second on the Alsemero Whom by all sweets that ever darkness tasted If I enjoy thee not thou nere enjoyst Ile blast the hopes and joyes of marriage Ile confess all my life I rate at nothing  Beatrice  Deflores  Deflores  I shall rest from all lovers plagues then I live in pain now that shooting eye Will burn my heart to cinders  Beatrice  O sir hear me  Deflores  She that in life and love refuses me In death and shame my partner she shall be  Beatrice  Stay hear me once for all I make thee master Of all the wealth I have in gold and jewels Let me go poor unto my bed with honor And i am rich in all things  Deflores  Let this silence thee The wealth of all Valentia shall not buy my pleasure from me Can you weep Fate from its determind purpose So soon may weep me  Beatrice  Vengeance begins Murder I see is followed by more sins  Was my creation in the womb so curst It must ingender with a Viper first Deflores  Come rise and shrowd your blushes in my bosome Silence is one of pleasures best receipts Thy peace is wrought for ever in this yeelding  Lasse how the Turtle pants Thoult love anon What thou so fearst and faintst to venture on

regardlessly Let the common shewer take it from distinction Beneath the starres upon yon Meteor Ever hang my fate mongst things corruptible I nere could pluck ti from him my loathing Was Prophet to the rest but nere believd Mine honour fell with him and now my life  Alsemero I am a stranger to your bed Your bed was cozned on the nuptiall night For which your false-bride died  Alfermero  Diaphanta Deflores  Yes and the while I coupled with your mate   At barly-break now we are left in hell  Vermandero  We are all there it circumscribes here  Deflores  I lovd this woman in spite of her
