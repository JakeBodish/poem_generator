
We passed old farmer Boothby in the field 
Rugged and straight he stood his body steeled
With stubbornness and age  We met his eyes
That never flinched or turned to compromise
And “Luck” he cried “good luck” and waved an arm
Knotted and sailor-like such as no farm
In all of Maine could boast of and away
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay   
We walked on leisurely until a bend
Showed him once more now working toward the end
Of one great path wearing his eighty years
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers 
Then we turned off abruptly took the road
Cutting the village the one with the commanding
View of the river  And we strode
More briskly now to the long pier that showed
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing 
In the canoe we stepped our paddles dipped
Leisurely downwards and the slim bark slipped
More on than in the water  Smoothly then
We shot its nose against the rippling current
Feeling the rising river’s half-deterrent
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade
To keep from swerving round while we delayed
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks
Or pass with lazy turns the picnic-rocks    
Blue eels flew under us and fishes darted
A thousand ways the once broad channel shrunk 
And over us the wise and noble-hearted
Twilight leaned down the sunset mists were parted 
And we with thoughts on tiptoe slunk
Down the green twisting alleys of the KennebunkMotionless in the meadows
The trees the rocks the cows   
And quiet dripped from the shadows
Like rain from heavy boughs 
The tree-toads started ringing
Their ceaseless silver bells
A land-locked breeze came swinging
Its censer of earthy smells 
The river’s tiny cañon
Stretched into dusky lands
Like a dark and silent companion
Evening held out her hands 
Hushed were the dawn’s bravados
Loud noon was a silenced cry 
And quiet slipped from the shadows
As stars slip out of the sky
