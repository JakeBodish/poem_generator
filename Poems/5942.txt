After joy raises you into the stratosphereride earth’s colors as you wheel down Fear backs you into a caveonly then do you cackle and hiss Curse at a tornado and it might curse back Why kick pebbles on your enemyYou will die without burying him The ascent out of despairmust be steady slow or your lungswill explode your blood boil Which is wisest to endure hungeror waddle among wolvesWarn those you love when the predatorapproaches  Screech loudest when youare the predator
