
In a new translator’s version of Genesis there’s no Adam 
No serpent  In paradise I don’t bleed  Fig leaf-free girldear God I say as we converse fluently without tongues
joined as two spice-drenched beloveds in a song of songscould we please ask the gardener to plant a pomegranate grove
by a stand of non-fruiting olive cultivars which don’t bloom
and aren’t so messy
