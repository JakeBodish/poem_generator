
I was someone in the distance
who never got closer 
I lived in the past so the present
was my future 
When I shook hands I dissolved
into a mirror
where I tended
my reflection
of features so faint
my mother
strained to see them 
I was the rind the zest
a heart marooned
in the guest of a friend
in the back row
of a twelve-step room 
I confessed to the priest
in his box suppressed
the north south east and west
desires that pull men
over the moon 
I crooned the self-help
tune that every glance
is a gift every second
chance a first
the suicide fence
on the tall bridge
a positive thing
for those crawling the walls
