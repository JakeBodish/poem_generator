
At the top of a hill each morning
I wait for the bus by the donut store 
Its pink sign looks hot
curls like a rope a stem to a brain 
You turn toward a jade
at the height of your neighborhood
stop at a light in its gut 
The sun starts to seep up
reaching all grasses and grooves of the city 
A white bus with black windows passes 
A few minutes later the city bus arrives like a room 
It crawls warm and dull to the west edge
breathing its heat a few baby hands
warming wide glass 
The billboard at my stop displays a large number to call 
A man walks his sniffing dog below it
sharp legs brushing wild onion 
At the base of the hill
I enter my code
push the gray gate open
allow the worn loop of my bag
down my arm walk to my station 
I drop the metal end of a hose
into a bucket turn the tough faucet 
Traveling after the sound
the cold rushes out
full force from the rubber
breaking into itself interrupting and filling
the round plastic space 
Hungry I pick up the water
