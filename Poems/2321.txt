
Im used to the emperors bitterness
I cant find the sweet place unless you make me
This face that is not my face I may
look made but when you touch me you make me
Make the oak say blossom The stripped say swell
The avenue pavement say river Make me
This shirt I cant take off The one
the nights without you gathered to make me
The new day The sweet place Tomorrow
whispering from tonights last light Make me
Kissing you without authorization
If you want me to stop youll have to make me
The ruined city Or is it a woman
interrupting your sleep to say Now To say Make me
