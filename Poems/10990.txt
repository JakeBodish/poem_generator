
The Tiger-Woman came to meWhen dusk was close and men were dull She beckoned from the jungle-pathI followed dreaming fanciful The Tiger-Woman’s face is paleBut oh her speaking eyes are dark No beast can move so lithe as sheBeside the matted river’s mark The jungle is a fearsome placeFor men who hunt and men who slayBut I was not afraid to goWhere Tiger-Woman led the way The Tiger-Woman’s lips are thinHer teeth are like the Tiger’s teeth Yet her soft hands are woman’s handsAnd oh the blood beats warm beneath She led me to a little glade The creepers with the moon inwove And two great striped beasts leaped upAnd fawned upon her breast in love The Tiger-Woman’s voice was sweetI hearkened and was not afraid She stroked the Tigers’ fearful jawsUpon their heads my hands I laid And all the jungle things drew nearAnd all the leaves a music madeLike spirits chanting in a choirAlong the bamboo colonnade Too sweet for human harps to soundIt touched my blood it fired my heartThe Tiger-Woman sang and ISang too and understood her art She kissed the Tiger’s snarling mouth She kissed I marveled that she could But now her lips were warm on mineI cared not they were dabbed with blood What if the traveller shuns my hutWhat if the world forgets to beWhat if I have the Tiger’s heart The Tiger-Woman loveth me
