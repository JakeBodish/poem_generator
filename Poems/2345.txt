
Crumbling is not an instants Act
A fundamental pause
Dilapidations processes
Are organized Decays  
Tis first a Cobweb on the Soul
A Cuticle of Dust
A Borer in the Axis
An Elemental Rust  
Ruin is formal   Devils work
Consecutive and slow  
Fail in an instant no man did
Slipping   is Crashes law
