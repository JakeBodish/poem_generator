there are shining masters
when I tell you what they
look like    some of it is
nearly false   their blue hair
but they are not ourselves   they
are equivalents   of action    they
compose forms    which we hearsound within a context
as if that action we are
images of    used us
the body becomes an instrument
sometimes the harp pierces the body
and a man only hangs on the strings
I hear the airborne-fire the dead rebels’
second speech which follows their live words
and the rice and the motorcycles
but public life has fallen asleep
like a secret name    the wrong-reader
will say he has pity for others
where the thought is born in hatred
of pity
