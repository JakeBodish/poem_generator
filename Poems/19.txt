Yes your childhood now a legend
gone to weeds still remembers the gray road
that set out to cross the desert of the future 
 
And how always just ahead
gray water glittered happy to be just a mirage 
Who steps off the gray bus at the depot
 
Sidewalks shudder all the way home 
Blinds close their scratchy eyes 
Who settles in your old room
 
Sniffy air sprawls as if it owns the place
and now your teenage secrets have no one to tell 
For the spider laying claim to the corner
 
there is a stickiness to spin that the living may beg
to be wrapped in silk and devoured
leaving not even the flinch from memory
