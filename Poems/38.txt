
The first story I ever write
is a bright crayon picture
of a dancing tree the branches
tossed by island wind 
I draw myself standing beside the tree
with a colorful parrot soaring above me
and a magical turtle clasped in my hand
and two yellow wings fluttering
on the proud shoulders of my ruffled
Cuban rumba dancers
fancy dress 
In my California kindergarten class
the teacher scolds me REAL TREES
DONT LOOK LIKE THAT 
Its the moment
when I first
begin to learn
that teachers
can be wrong 
They have never seen
the dancing plants
of Cuba
