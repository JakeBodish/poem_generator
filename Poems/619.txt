
That field nag old-penny
swayback  Low hawk to
ducks in train to a quad of geese
in case  Last night the long
 
moon lay it seemed a tissue
of snow but then dawn told
that wasnt so  Late morning now
the fire the hearth eggs
 
sitting for the mute plate
and fork this pen making
a thing of them  Two more nights 
waterfowl safe and noisy
 
in the dusk the low rails
running flank to the river
at midnight find what theyll
make of that river this moon
