
We kept only the keys
letters and photos  
everything else stayed behind
when we left the house 
That can happen when
a nation changes overnight
when those you know
turn into
a gate of feathers  
and the thing about feathers is
they know whats been missed 
For years I watch
my neighbors house
from others windows 
different countries
various homes
some of brick some of stone 
Some never imagine
what a home can mean
when an unfinished tune
traps the ceiling 
I pretend
never to have
seen a body midair
a fathers hands
planted on the ground 
after all
what we dont admit to
never happened 
But I couldnt
change that day in Murcia
when water brought light
to the door
I am seven
it is the day before our departure
the day my father
gives me a notebook
and I tell himthis is where Ill keep my country
