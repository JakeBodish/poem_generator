
You are for me as you cannot beFor yourself chaos without demandTo speak the amethyst nothingHidden inside the trinket shop’s stoneDark eyes dark asterisks where lightFootnotes a margin left blank  YouDon’t look up to look up at the sky  Your ears parenthesize nothingThat occurs that I keep from occurringIn the poem on the page as you areFor me not a shadow but a shadeWhose darkness drops from no objectBut is itself yourself a form of timeSpanning nothing never is your name
