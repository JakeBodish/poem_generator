 the radio reports how in 2050
farming Massachusetts will be like farming Georgia 
all’s flux no one can say what will grow in Georgia

My inner cynic saysdon’t bother this is navel gazing
 
 my friend at Yale says my hunger
to be near zucchinis

 also should be fed

Ecosystem of yard or field or mind
 
these cucumbers are more art than science
more daydream
