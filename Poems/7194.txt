
Learn then what morals critics ought to showFor tis but half a judges task to know Tis not enough taste judgment learning joinIn all you speak let truth and candour shineThat not alone what to your sense is dueAll may allow but seek your friendship too 
    Be silent always when you doubt your senseAnd speak though sure with seeming diffidenceSome positive persisting fops we knowWho if once wrong will needs be always soBut you with pleasure own your errors pastAnd make each day a critic on the last 
    Tis not enough your counsel still be trueBlunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods doMen must be taught as if you taught them notAnd things unknown proposed as things forgot Without good breeding truth is disapprovdThat only makes superior sense belovd 
    Be niggards of advice on no pretenceFor the worst avarice is that of sense With mean complacence neer betray your trustNor be so civil as to prove unjust Fear not the anger of the wise to raiseThose best can bear reproof who merit praise 
    Twere well might critics still this freedom takeBut Appius reddens at each word you speakAnd stares  Tremendous  with a threatening eyeLike some fierce tyrant in old tapestryFear most to tax an honourable foolWhose right it is uncensurd to be dullSuch without wit are poets when they pleaseAs without learning they can take degrees Leave dangerous truths to unsuccessful satiresAnd flattery to fulsome dedicatorsWhom when they praise the world believes no moreThan when they promise to give scribbling oer Tis best sometimes your censure to restrainAnd charitably let the dull be vainYour silence there is better than your spiteFor who can rail so long as they can writeStill humming on their drowsy course they keepAnd lashd so long like tops are lashd asleep False steps but help them to renew the raceAs after stumbling jades will mend their pace What crowds of these impenitently boldIn sounds and jingling syllables grown oldStill run on poets in a raging veinEven to the dregs and squeezings of the brainStrain out the last dull droppings of their senseAnd rhyme with all the rage of impotence
    Such shameless bards we have and yet tis trueThere are as mad abandond critics too The bookful blockhead ignorantly readWith loads of learned lumber in his headWith his own tongue still edifies his earsAnd always listning to himself appears All books he reads and all he reads assailsFrom Drydens Fables down to Durfeys Tales With him most authors steal their works or buyGarth did not write his own  Dispensary  Name a new play and hes the poets friendNay showd his faults but when would poets mendNo place so sacred from such fops is barrdNor is Pauls church more safe than Pauls churchyardNay fly to altars there theyll talk you deadFor fools rush in where angels fear to tread Distrustful sense with modest caution speaksIt still looks home and short excursions makesBut rattling nonsense in full volleys breaksAnd never shockd and never turnd asideBursts out resistless with a thundring tide 
    But wheres the man who counsel can bestowStill pleasd to teach and yet not proud to knowUnbiasd or by favour or by spiteNot dully prepossessd nor blindly rightThough learnd well-bred and though well-bred sincereModestly bold and humanly severeWho to a friend his faults can freely showAnd gladly praise the merit of a foeBlest with a taste exact yet unconfindA knowledge both of books and human kindGenrous converse a soul exempt from prideAnd love to praise with reason on his side
    Such once were critics such the happy fewAthens and Rome in better ages knew The mighty Stagirite first left the shoreSpread all his sails and durst the deeps exploreHe steerd securely and discoverd farLed by the light of the Mæonian Star Poets a race long unconfind and freeStill fond and proud of savage libertyReceivd his laws and stood convincd twas fitWho conquerd nature should preside oer wit 
    Horace still charms with graceful negligenceAnd without methods talks us into senseWill like a friend familiarly conveyThe truest notions in the easiest way He who supreme in judgment as in witMight boldly censure as he boldly writYet judgd with coolness though he sung with fireHis precepts teach but what his works inspire Our critics take a contrary extremeThey judge with fury but they write with flemeNor suffers Horace more in wrong translationsBy wits than critics in as wrong quotations 
    See Dionysius Homers thoughts refineAnd call new beauties forth from evry line
    Fancy and art in gay Petronius pleaseThe scholars learning with the courtiers ease 
    In grave Quintilians copious work we findThe justest rules and clearest method joindThus useful arms in magazines we placeAll rangd in order and disposd with graceBut less to please the eye than arm the handStill fit for use and ready at command 
    Thee bold Longinus all the Nine inspireAnd bless their critic with a poets fire An ardent judge who zealous in his trustWith warmth gives sentence yet is always justWhose own example strengthens all his lawsAnd is himself that great sublime he draws 
    Thus long succeeding critics justly reigndLicence repressd and useful laws ordaindLearning and Rome alike in empire grewAnd arts still followd where her eagles flewFrom the same foes at last both felt their doomAnd the same age saw learning fall and Rome With tyranny then superstition joindAs that the body this enslavd the mindMuch was believd but little understoodAnd to be dull was construd to be goodA second deluge learning thus oer-runAnd the monks finishd what the Goths begun 
    At length Erasmus that great injurd nameThe glory of the priesthood and the shameStemmd the wild torrent of a barbrous ageAnd drove those holy Vandals off the stage 
    But see each Muse in Leos golden daysStarts from her trance and trims her witherd baysRomes ancient genius oer its ruins spreadShakes off the dust and rears his revrend headThen sculpture and her sister-arts reviveStones leapd to form and rocks began to liveWith sweeter notes each rising temple rungA Raphael painted and a Vida sung Immortal Vida on whose honourd browThe poets bays and critics ivy growCremona now shall ever boast thy nameAs next in place to Mantua next in fame
    But soon by impious arms from Latium chasdTheir ancient bounds the banished Muses passdThence arts oer all the northern world advanceBut critic-learning flourishd most in France The rules a nation born to serve obeysAnd Boileau still in right of Horace sways But we brave Britons foreign laws despisdAnd kept unconquerd and uncivilisdFierce for the liberties of wit and boldWe still defied the Romans as of old Yet some there were among the sounder fewOf those who less presumd and better knewWho durst assert the juster ancient causeAnd here restord wits fundamental laws Such was the Muse whose rules and practice tellNatures chief master-piece is writing well Such was Roscommon not more learnd than goodWith manners genrous as his noble bloodTo him the wit of Greece and Rome was knownAnd evry authors merit but his own Such late was Walsh the Muses judge and friendWho justly knew to blame or to commendTo failings mild but zealous for desertThe clearest head and the sincerest heart This humble praise lamented shade receiveThis praise at least a grateful Muse may giveThe Muse whose early voice you taught to singPrescribd her heights and prund her tender wingHer guide now lost no more attempts to riseBut in low numbers short excursions triesContent if hence th unlearnd their wants may viewThe learnd reflect on what before they knewCareless of censure nor too fond of fameStill pleasd to praise yet not afraid to blameAverse alike to flatter or offendNot free from faults nor yet too vain to mend
