Dolorous here he made his standLike those who are beatenBehind the mountains and in front the seaTo the west a rock by the brown river eaten Here beauty went along the strandSmashing green waves against the white sand “Beyond the rock there that’s his thatch ”So spoke up a neighbor “And you’ll be finding leather string on latchAnd him inside at peace from labor ”So he was run in the fox to his earthHe the old reaver warm by his hearthBut where was the booty the gems and doubloonsFilched from fat merchants by tropical moonsHe of all pirates prime hierophantNo swords no silver no silk of Levant“Four things” he answered “of all things that areA rock a river a tree and a star”This is his wisdom He welcomed me illI passed by the tree and strove up the hill This is the saying of one wise as heA river a rock a star and a treeThis is the place the shrine of the sageWho lived his last days with beauty for wage Here’s where the tree was long ago humbledAnd a space points us out where granite has crumbled The river is empty and a wind sweeps the stonesThe stars are not whiter than freebooter’s bones
