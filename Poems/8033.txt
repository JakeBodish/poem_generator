My black face fades   
hiding inside the black granite    
I said I wouldnt  
dammit No tears    
Im stone  Im flesh    
My clouded reflection eyes me   
like a bird of prey the profile of night   
slanted against morning  I turn   
this way the stone lets me go    
I turn that way Im inside   
the Vietnam Veterans MemorialVietnam Veterans Memorial Located in Washington D C  the Memorial is roughly 500 feet wide and the names of soldiers who died in Vietnam are etched on its black granite walls  For more information and photos visit The Wall-USA 
again depending on the light   
to make a difference    
I go down the 58022 names58022 names The number of names of dead soldiers etched on the wall at the time of Komunyakaa’s composing of this poem  As of 2009 there are now 58261 names listed on the Memorial of which approximately 1200 are listed as missing in action MIAs or prisoners of war POWs    
half-expecting to find   
my own in letters like smoke    
I touch the name Andrew JohnsonAndrew Johnson A soldier from the poet’s hometown of Bogalusa Louisiana also the name of 17th U S  president 1865-69 who succeeded Lincoln and denied freed slaves equal protection under the law by vetoing the Civil Rights Bill and the Freedman’s Bureau Bill in 1866    
I see the booby traps white flash    
Names shimmer on a womans blouse   
but when she walks away   
the names stay on the wall    
Brushstrokes flash a red birds   
wings cutting across my stare    
The sky  A plane in the sky    
A white vets image floats   
closer to me then his pale eyes   
look through mine  Im a window    
Hes lost his right arm   
inside the stone  In the black mirror   
a woman’s trying to erase names   
No shes brushing a boys hair
