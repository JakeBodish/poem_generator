
I dunno yer highfalutin words but heres th way it seems
When Im peekin out th winder o my little House o Dreams
Ive been lookin roun this big ol world as bizzy as a hive
An I want t tell ye neighbor mine its good t be alive 
Ive ben settin here a-thinkin hard an say it seems t me
That this big ol world is jest about as good as it kin be
With its starvin little babies an its battles an its strikes
An its profiteers an hold-up men th dawggone little tykes
An its hungry men that fought fer us that nobody employs 
An I think Why shucks were jest a lot o grown-up little boys
An I settle back an light my pipe an reach fer Mothers hand
An I wouldnt swap my peace o mind fer nothin in the land
Fer this world uv ours that jest was made fer folks like me an you
Is a purty good ol place t live say neighbor aint it true
