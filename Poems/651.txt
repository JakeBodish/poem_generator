
Behind the house in a field
theres a metal box I buried
full of childhood treasure a map
of my secret place a few lead pennies
from 1943 
The rest Ive forgotten
forgotten even the exact spot
I covered with moss and loam 
 
Now Im back and twenty years
have made so little difference
I suspect they never happened
this face in the mirror
aged with pencil and putty 
I suspect even
the box has moved as a mole would move
to a new place long ago
