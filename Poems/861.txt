
Let others sing of knights and paladinsIn aged accents and untimely wordsPaint shadows in imaginary linesWhich well the reach of their high wits recordsBut I must sing of thee and those fair eyesAuthentic shall my verse in time to comeWhen yet th unborn shall say “Lo where she liesWhose beauty made him speak that else was dumb ”These are the arks the trophies I erectThat fortify thy name against old ageAnd these thy sacred virtues must protectAgainst the dark and times consuming rage Though th error of my youth they shall discoverSuffice they show I livd and was thy lover
