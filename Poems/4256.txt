
Some things no one says aloud 
But he was there if he says he was 
Bleaching fields and buttermilk 
The stench of breweries and lye 
Two-thirds of his life before this one Sky 
His current city rises off a river not Lek
though here in the gallery a train ride away
The impossible familiar  The somehow known 
The curator has writtenOn the crowded ferry cows attempt to drink  
But anyone can see that one scratches her neck
a good-sailor cow sickle-hocked not parched 
Cows like that  Yes  He remembers 
Also that downriver float the fishmongers’ baskets
of haddock and crab 
On the way home this will be also his view
the river running toward its source a reverse birthing 
But now he sees that Rembrandt has wired coils of light
into the shipbuilder’s ruff 
He remembers shipbuilders the horizon
upon which sailed their fluyts and above which homesick 
That was what we call a long time ago
because it has to be called something 
And now The guard warns him back from one world 
Rose hip  Willow  Sea salt        The infinite clouds
