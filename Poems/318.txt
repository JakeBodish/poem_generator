i  
impossible  
sterile extrusion
the rigour of its beauty
its crumpled geometry
worked to defeat 
light stopped 
locked in its form
shuttered and windless
in dry rifts
split furrowed mottled creased 
ii  
trundling
bulging from behind 
its too heavy body
its natural carapace
shelving green
sinking the sea beneath it
the difficulty piling up
rising to the surface  
iii  
swirling backward
on blue flowering currents
rolling up
sudden in spray and mist
 like the turning of a page
that leaves us blinded for a second 
unlocked in a milky scum
half hid long on its axis
growing open wounds
of violet emerald silver 
a point of astonishment 
lapses of silence  air
