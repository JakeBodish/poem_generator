Anne identified with Cate until it became a bona fide
illness for Boris had left Cate resulting not only
in psychic estrangement but an unconscious stream
of hostility directed not at Boris but at his new woman
Anne whom Cate viewed as her rival  Cate remained
excessively tender with Boris though Cate for him
had been a “totem animal” from which he gained power
by “eating ” Whereas Boris was the patriarch
Anne was the ego alien and whereas Cate was Anne’s
fixation Anne was no one’s obsession so she was
admitted to a psychiatric ward with the unbidden
associations she could not be induced to abandon 
On the rare occasions she slept the manifest and latent
content of her dreams was the dance of abandonment
between Boris and Cate which Anne in her waking hours
projected onto the walls as though screening a silent film 
She could not be induced to abandon this footage
she could not be induced to abandon her object love
of Boris whose own object choice was his
ego-libido or her identification with Cate who felt
no friendship towards Anne  Soon Anne drew a mental
triangle on every surface she saw be it phallic or
concave and sometimes this triangle was isosceles
sometimes it was equilateral and often it was right
