
I sent him from home hardly more than a child 
Years later he came back loving avocados 
In the distant kitchen where hed flipped burgers
and tossed salads hed mastered how to prepare
the pear-shaped fruit  He took a knife and plied
his way into the thick skin with a bravado
and gentleness Id never seen in him  He nudged
the halves apart grabbed a teaspoon and carefully
eased out the heart holding it as if it were fragile 
He took one half then the other of the armadillo-
hided fruit and slid his spoon where flesh edged
against skin working it under and around sparing
the edible pulp  An artist working at an easel
he filled the center holes with chopped tomatoes 
The broken pieces made whole again merged
into two reconstructed hearts a delicate and rare
surgery  My boy whod gone away angry and wild
had somehow learned how to unclose
what had once been shut tight how to urge
out the stony heart and handle it with care 
Beneath the rind hed grown as tender and mild
as that avocado its rubies nestled in peridot
our forks slipping into the buttery texture
of unfamiliar joy two halves of what we shared
