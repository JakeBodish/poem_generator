
That this mountainside looks like a face is accidental
which is a shame for I dearly love to laugh 
The touch-smoothed redwood cross-section in its rings
of growth and brightness
seems like a sun seen from underwater
wobbly as jelly mocking my
inability to find a job my food stamps
and saddens me to see
the teens tagging themselves in nearby places
to earn a virtual friends respect or boasting
other symptoms of youth while leaving
their greasy fingerprints on the thick lenses of my glasses
mocking my desire for artwork
to remain packed in straw and in music
for sleepers halfway awake to grow wild in 
It all gives me faith in arranging I guess
when there is nothing else I seem much good at but fuss
and copy and paste with a head full of so many other worries 
Got a check today  Bought a book I cant read
without it putting me to sleep
with its out-of-date luxuriousness 
So instead of reading it
I stayed up and listened to Harry Partchs songAnd on the Seventh Day Petals Fell in Petaluma
dedicating it to the memory of Ramon Novarro
hoping it would arch electrically above him
with all the characteristics of fire
all night
all day
and soak his early spring colors in a late autumn
sun as pale as silver and fern-green skiesto draw light
through midnight
