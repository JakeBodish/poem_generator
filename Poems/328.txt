
I grew up in a big house
where weakness and expressions of joy
deserved punishment 
And I was raised on the via politica
with the grease of yesterday’s glories
a thick grease collected under arctic skies 
I was lit up  My notebooks my hair my heart reeked of
smoke 
 
That’s when we saw each other clearly 
Or rather what remained of us 
Damaged like lottery numbers
scratched away with a blade 
 
How different we were
 
Those with round faces were righteous
those with narrow faces were cautious 
 
One listened secretly to Puccini
another to silence the music’s music 
The oldest one declaimed monologues
inside a ten-by-ten-foot cell
he had built for himself 
 
And the mysterious one
simply had diabetes 
 
But how similar we were in severe circumstances
 
Alarmed like a flock of magpies
that the smallest stone sends into the sky
toward the mouth of the abyss 
 
Then it became obvious there wasn’t enough space for everyone 
We separated  Some went on living in via verbum
telling of what they knew what they witnessed
and so through their narrative
creating their own grease 
 
The others crossed over the ocean 
 
And those in particular who went farthest away
never speak of their annoying history
of wretched survival burying it
in the darkest crevices on their being 
Unfortunately as with perfume its scent
lingers there for much much longer
