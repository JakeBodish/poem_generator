
Jesus did not ride that monstrous wave
not Yahweh Jah Allah none of the major
 
Gods or the minor ones not even the godless
strode that bugger which sliced our lives
 
in two the past where we danced ballroom
while the children played carom and mangos
 
stained our lapels and today hobbling
scavenging in ash heaps how easy
 
the arithmetic day and night two by two 
Bring on the mind workers 
 
Let a thousand doctors bloom 
I lived right here on the x my name
 
is blue sea green blue blue green
I do not speak in tongues  I am not
 
disordered a babbler  I did not lose
anybody close to me just 30000
 
fellow island bees not to worry machan
old fellow I will subscribe tomorrow
 
the order of every day skip and jump rope
whistle talk to aid workers even swim
