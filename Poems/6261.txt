You said anyone could walk in
with a pack of explosives as we passed through
the crowds of tourists and school kids   
under the glass-grid ceiling lit with sun 
I was saying She’s our earth our body our sex
as we drifted down the halls of statues and colonnades
and hunks of facades of Greek temples until we found
room 22 “The Hellenistic World” where a bronze face
in a glass box on the wall stared back at us Head from a bronze cult statue
of Anahita a local goddess
in the guise of Aphrodite
