youths around her shone But evry eye was fixd on her alone  On her white breast a sparkling cross she wore Which Jews might kiss and infidels adore  Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose Quick as her eyes and as unfixd as those Favours to none to all she smiles extends Oft she rejects but never once offends  Bright as the sun her eyes the gazers strike And like the sun they shine on all alike  Yet graceful ease and sweetness void of pride Might hide her faults if belles had faults to hide If to her share some female errors fall Look on her face and youll forget em all         This nymph to the destruction of mankind Nourishd two locks which graceful hung behind In equal curls and well conspird to deck With shining ringlets the smooth ivry neck  Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains And mighty hearts are held in slender chains  With hairy springes we the birds betray Slight lines of hair surprise the finney prey Fair tresses mans imperial race ensnare And beauty draws us with a single hair         Th adventrous baron the bright locks admird He saw he wishd and to the prize aspird  Resolvd to win he meditates the way By force to ravish or by fraud betray For when success a lovers toil attends Few ask if fraud or force attaind his ends         For this ere Phoebus rose he had implord Propitious Heavn and evry powr adord But chiefly love to love an altar built Of twelve vast French romances neatly gilt  There lay three garters half a pair of gloves And all the trophies of his former loves With tender billet-doux he lights the pyre And breathes three amrous sighs to raise the fire  Then prostrate falls and begs with ardent eyes Soon to obtain and long possess the prize The powrs gave ear and granted half his prayr The rest the winds dispersd in empty air         But now secure the painted vessel glides The sun-beams trembling on the floating tides While melting music steals upon the sky And softend sounds along the waters die  Smooth flow the waves the zephyrs gently play Belinda smild and all the world was gay  All but the Sylph with careful thoughts opprest Th impending woe sat heavy on his breast  He summons strait his denizens of air The lucid squadrons round the sails repair Soft oer the shrouds aerial whispers breathe That seemd but zephyrs to the train beneath  Some to the sun their insect-wings unfold Waft on the breeze or sink in clouds of gold  Transparent forms too fine for mortal sight Their fluid bodies half dissolvd in light Loose to the wind their airy garments flew Thin glittring textures of the filmy dew Dippd in the richest tincture of the skies Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes While evry beam new transient colours flings Colours that change wheneer they wave their wings  Amid the circle on the gilded mast Superior by the head was Ariel placd His purple pinions opning to the sun He raisd his azure wand and thus begun         Ye Sylphs and Sylphids to your chief give ear Fays Fairies Genii Elves and Dæmons hear Ye know the spheres and various tasks assignd By laws eternal to th aerial kind  Some in the fields of purest æther play And bask and whiten in the blaze of day  Some guide the course of wandring orbs on high Or roll the planets through the boundless sky  Some less refind beneath the moons pale light Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night Or suck the mists in grosser air below Or dip their pinions in the painted bow Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main Or oer the glebe distil the kindly rain  Others on earth oer human race preside Watch all their ways and all their actions guide Of these the chief the care of nations own And guard with arms divine the British throne         Our humbler province is to tend the fair Not a less pleasing though less glorious care  To save the powder from too rude a gale Nor let th imprisond essences exhale To draw fresh colours from the vernal flowrs To steal from rainbows eer they drop in showrs A brighter wash to curl their waving hairs Assist their blushes and inspire their airs Nay oft in dreams invention we bestow To change a flounce or add a furbelow         This day black omens threat the brightest fair That eer deservd a watchful spirits care Some dire disaster or by force or slight But what or where the fates have wrapt in night  Whether the nymph shall break Dianas law Or some frail china jar receive a flaw Or stain her honour or her new brocade Forget her prayrs or miss a masquerade Or lose her heart or necklace at a ball Or whether Heavn has doomd that Shock must fall  Haste then ye spirits to your charge repair The fluttring fan be Zephyrettas care The drops to thee Brillante we consign And Momentilla let the watch be thine Do thou Crispissa tend her favrite lock Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock         To fifty chosen Sylphs of special note We trust th important charge the petticoat Oft have we known that sevn-fold fence to fail Though stiff with hoops and armd with ribs of whale  Form a strong line about the silver bound And guard the wide circumference around         Whatever spirit careless of his charge His post neglects or leaves the fair at large Shall feel sharp vengeance soon oertake his sins Be stoppd in vials or transfixd with pins Or plungd in lakes of bitter washes lie Or wedgd whole ages in a bodkins eye Gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain While cloggd he beats his silken wings in vain Or alum styptics with contracting powr Shrink his thin essence like a rivelld flowr  Or as Ixion fixd the wretch shall feel The giddy motion of the whirling mill In fumes of burning chocolate shall glow And tremble at the sea that froths below        He spoke the spirits from the sails descend Some orb in orb around the nymph extend Some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair Some hang upon the pendants of her ear With beating hearts the dire event they wait Anxious and trembling for the birth of fate
