
My favorite is the cream puff lie
the kind inflated with hot air
expanded to make an heroic-sized story 
 
Another is the cannoli a long lie
well-packed with nutty details
lightly wrapped in flakey truth 
 
A macaroon isnt a little white lie
but its covered
with self-serving coconut 
 
The apple tart carries slices
of sour gossip only
slightly sweetened with truth 
 
Then theres the napoleon
an Iago lie of pernicious intent
layer upon layer of dark deceit
