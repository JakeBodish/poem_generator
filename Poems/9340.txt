
The column of the commander yielded to our first sweep 
Even the water jar for our diggers we set on the south wall
of the general’s tomb without knowing it  So we began 
His armies retook Nubia Libya and the Levant
lost under the sway-bellied lantern-jawed Sun King 
Overseer of all scribes Overseer of the priests of Horus
Grain-giver to all lands Royal chief of staff Regent
the general had himself carried on his palanquin
through the wailing processions
to oversee the work on this place  And so carved thus
one of his men punches a Nubian in the face 
The general was low-born everything had counted
and he knew what counted most 
His platoons lift open palms towards Tutankhamun 
The general towers as a sway-girdled go-between at court
for beseeching Libyans 
Only the pearl-handled revolvers do not figure here
or the comeback challenge Nuts in the Ardennes winter forest 
He had himself carried beyond the busy streets of the dead
in the city of the dead sloping back from the bluff
to a higher private terrace looking across to Memphis 
But then he rose to Pharaoh  So he is not here  Instead
his first wife lay here and then his queen also 
At his own royal tomb in the Valley where the designs
remained uncarved sketching idea along stone
he does not rest either  The fine picklock hand
got past Anubis and the reared serpents and got to him
the Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt  It got past Truth
with her high feather which moved at the slightest disturbance 
The general did deep obeisance to her  He is not here 
What at last moves the heart
So much already moved even in his own century
architects prying loose mud bricks of the core for new tombs 
Cult funded in perpetuity gone in two generations 
So Coleridge who was indisposed that day prudently
remained in the circle of lime trees while his friends went off
on their walk through the countryside  He followed them in his mind 
That way no one would have to dismantle Horeheb’s outer court
to secure bricks for the statuary room and facing stones 
He cast his mind outward a net over his dear ones
sending them at pace through the middle distance of steeples
hill lines and the murder of Lamb’s mother by his sister
a brief madness thus through the appropriately middle distance
where such things are built and performed in fact no closer no farther
then on out to the cleansing rim of apocalypse evening
in the bath of waning fire one bird stitching
the whole veil of showings tight along its upper hem 
though he was not there he could tell them that none the less
he was next to his words and his word was with them even
unto the rim of their wandering and their turning back 
One dome of air and fire  But he was not there  Nor I here 
What removes the heart from what moves it
As if I were the lecturer before a congress of doctors
his clinching point approaching when suddenly he stared out
in silence and at last said Ladies and gentlemen esteemed colleagues
the only thing I can see at this moment inside my brain
such as it is is a little white mouse chasing a little white ball
