
Methought I saw my late espoused saint
       Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave
       Whom Joves great son to her glad husband gave
       Rescud from death by force though pale and faint 
Mine as whom washd from spot of child-bed taint
       Purification in the old Law did save
       And such as yet once more I trust to have
       Full sight of her in Heaven without restraint
Came vested all in white pure as her mind
       Her face was veild yet to my fancied sight
       Love sweetness goodness in her person shind
So clear as in no face with more delight 
       But Oh as to embrace me she inclind
       I wakd she fled and day brought back my night
