                17Hurry pin my wrists in placenail me to your bed like Christ      comfort me caress my face      fuck me when I expect it least 
                45From nerves veins valves ventriclesfrom tendons cartilage nerves ductsfrom follicles nerves ribs clavicles      from every pore my soul erupts 
                47You liked that you actually came but how Explain to me  But why If you got off on that youre doomed  A charge I cant and dont deny 
                71Why is even pleasure a kind of choreWhy is what sense I have left leaving meCome on explain  Who do you take me for your personal doctor of philosophy
