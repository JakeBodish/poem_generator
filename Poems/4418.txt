This spirit she came upon me as I slept   in such a way
my life or yours could come to be so thoroughly owned   
she was reckless   I knew she would make me run away
with her   I said spirit slow down   but the spirit wanted
to ride   but I am so afraid I said   I have all this tenderness
to impart   but the tenderness is not mine to give away   
but all your tenderness is your own tenderness said the spirit   
it is not I said   why then did you give it all away   I did
not give it away   then it is yours to give away   the spirit
riddled like this   if in her arms I read a story   if out of her
arms I had the choice to write one but I chose not   chose not
because I did not know where I was going   because my path
broke down  I had this choice   stay or split   if I knew that
were I to split one part of me would become a ghost   if I did
not know yet which part   if the voice calling me out asked me
to describe the splitting  I did   if I said it was like smoke
spiraling outwards   it was like smoke lifting off me taking on
form  leaving me   if  it was like a delicate girl I never met
but dreamed of   if it was like the flags of my youth fluttering
far out at sea   like breathing out a breath you will never take
back in   but you know you can never take any breath back in   
if I saw her outside of myself  mourned her like I have mourned
no other loss   if I knew it was both a miracle  the most terrible
tragedy   to open up   release a flame   watch the flame go   
have you seen it A flame that can ride water   she was my
daughter  if I could I would send her to you if I sent her to you
would you take her Listen I ran this out of me because I knew
it would burn me down   my trainers press the ground  lift up
again   I saw myself on my back in high grass in high summer
with everything coming to me   how this ghost left me  printed
a new person all over me   I could peel her off or live like this   
I cried   one or both will destroy me   the spirit called it fate but
I knew it was just drama   I will never know why a good person must die   
fate does not exist I said but every door I opened showed yesyes yes   I shut each one  locked it   checked the locks
three times   went back  checked them again   shook them to be
sure   drew hearts round the keyholes so the spirit would know
I loved her   it wasn’t   it was never   that I didn’t love her
