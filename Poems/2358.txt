
All summer the city engines low
roar capsizes our bodies into sleep
groans
                evacuation 
                                                   Lost to a watery
anamnesis so warm it requires a raft
thatched from deaths
                                         flotsam to necklace its shore
                              I swim on calling your name
In my dreams something is always deserting
But tonight no fast shadows of birds
No oceanic flowers disrobing butterflies
or bright beach of childs porridge and bones 
                                                                                 Instead someone weaving
a net from fallen hair in and around our bed
to catch the breath blood and ritual
motions that oiled us
                                            as one candle in a cave
In your dreams someone is always resisting being savedMy teeth are on fire you say I saidDont fly for the labyrinth once
I thought you were admonishing me to go away
I dont remember most others a thousand seasons
phonographed in through a wounded windowEveryone cant have a cactus
Just o k  empty all the rice from my legs
