
In these deep solitudes and awful cellsWhere heavnly-pensive contemplation dwellsAnd ever-musing melancholy reignsWhat means this tumult in a vestals veinsWhy rove my thoughts beyond this last retreatWhy feels my heart its long-forgotten heatYet yet I love From Abelard it cameAnd Eloisa yet must kiss the name 
     Dear fatal name rest ever unrevealdNor pass these lips in holy silence seald Hide it my heart within that close disguiseWhere mixd with Gods his lovd idea liesO write it not my hand the name appearsAlready written wash it out my tearsIn vain lost Eloisa weeps and praysHer heart still dictates and her hand obeys 
     Relentless walls whose darksome round containsRepentant sighs and voluntary painsYe rugged rocks which holy knees have wornYe grots and caverns shaggd with horrid thornShrines where their vigils pale-eyd virgins keepAnd pitying saints whose statues learn to weepThough cold like you unmovd and silent grownI have not yet forgot myself to stone All is not Heavns while Abelard has partStill rebel nature holds out half my heartNor prayrs nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrainNor tears for ages taught to flow in vain 
     Soon as thy letters trembling I uncloseThat well-known name awakens all my woes Oh name for ever sad for ever dearStill breathd in sighs still usherd with a tear I tremble too whereer my own I findSome dire misfortune follows close behind Line after line my gushing eyes oerflowLed through a sad variety of woeNow warm in love now withring in thy bloomLost in a convents solitary gloomThere stern religion quenchd th unwilling flameThere died the best of passions love and fame 
     Yet write oh write me all that I may joinGriefs to thy griefs and echo sighs to thine Nor foes nor fortune take this powr awayAnd is my Abelard less kind than theyTears still are mine and those I need not spareLove but demands what else were shed in prayrNo happier task these faded eyes pursueTo read and weep is all they now can do 
     Then share thy pain allow that sad reliefAh more than share it give me all thy grief Heavn first taught letters for some wretchs aidSome banishd lover or some captive maidThey live they speak they breathe what love inspiresWarm from the soul and faithful to its firesThe virgins wish without her fears impartExcuse the blush and pour out all the heartSpeed the soft intercourse from soul to soulAnd waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole 
     Thou knowst how guiltless first I met thy flameWhen Love approachd me under Friendships nameMy fancy formd thee of angelic kindSome emanation of th all-beauteous Mind Those smiling eyes attempring evry dayShone sweetly lambent with celestial day Guiltless I gazd heavn listend while you sungAnd truths divine came mended from that tongue From lips like those what precept faild to moveToo soon they taught me twas no sin to love Back through the paths of pleasing sense I ranNor wishd an Angel whom I lovd a Man Dim and remote the joys of saints I seeNor envy them that heavn I lose for thee 
     How oft when pressd to marriage have I saidCurse on all laws but those which love has madeLove free as air at sight of human tiesSpreads his light wings and in a moment fliesLet wealth let honour wait the wedded dameAugust her deed and sacred be her fameBefore true passion all those views removeFame wealth and honour what are you to LoveThe jealous God when we profane his firesThose restless passions in revenge inspiresAnd bids them make mistaken mortals groanWho seek in love for aught but love alone Should at my feet the worlds great master fallHimself his throne his world Id scorn em allNot Caesars empress would I deign to proveNo make me mistress to the man I loveIf there be yet another name more freeMore fond than mistress make me that to theeOh happy state when souls each other drawWhen love is liberty and nature lawAll then is full possessing and possessdNo craving void left aching in the breastEvn thought meets thought ere from the lips it partAnd each warm wish springs mutual from the heart This sure is bliss if bliss on earth there beAnd once the lot of Abelard and me 
     Alas how changd what sudden horrors riseA naked lover bound and bleeding liesWhere where was Eloise her voice her handHer poniard had opposd the dire command Barbarian stay that bloody stroke restrainThe crime was common common be the pain I can no more by shame by rage suppressdLet tears and burning blushes speak the rest 
    Canst thou forget that sad that solemn dayWhen victims at yon altars foot we layCanst thou forget what tears that moment fellWhen warm in youth I bade the world farewellAs with cold lips I kissd the sacred veilThe shrines all trembld and the lamps grew paleHeavn scarce believd the conquest it surveydAnd saints with wonder heard the vows I made Yet then to those dread altars as I drewNot on the Cross my eyes were fixd but youNot grace or zeal love only was my callAnd if I lose thy love I lose my all Come with thy looks thy words relieve my woeThose still at least are left thee to bestow Still on that breast enamourd let me lieStill drink delicious poison from thy eyePant on thy lip and to thy heart be pressdGive all thou canst and let me dream the rest Ah no instruct me other joys to prizeWith other beauties charm my partial eyesFull in my view set all the bright abodeAnd make my soul quit Abelard for God 
    Ah think at least thy flock deserves thy carePlants of thy hand and children of thy prayr From the false world in early youth they fledBy thee to mountains wilds and deserts led You raisd these hallowd walls the desert smildAnd Paradise was opend in the wild No weeping orphan saw his fathers storesOur shrines irradiate or emblaze the floorsNo silver saints by dying misers givnHere bribd the rage of ill-requited heavnBut such plain roofs as piety could raiseAnd only vocal with the Makers praise In these lone walls their days eternal boundThese moss-grown domes with spiry turrets crowndWhere awful arches make a noonday nightAnd the dim windows shed a solemn lightThy eyes diffusd a reconciling rayAnd gleams of glory brightend all the day But now no face divine contentment wearsTis all blank sadness or continual tears See how the force of others prayrs I tryO pious fraud of amrous charityBut why should I on others prayrs dependCome thou my father brother husband friendAh let thy handmaid sister daughter moveAnd all those tender names in one thy loveThe darksome pines that oer yon rocks reclindWave high and murmur to the hollow windThe wandring streams that shine between the hillsThe grots that echo to the tinkling rillsThe dying gales that pant upon the treesThe lakes that quiver to the curling breezeNo more these scenes my meditation aidOr lull to rest the visionary maid But oer the twilight groves and dusky cavesLong-sounding aisles and intermingled gravesBlack Melancholy sits and round her throwsA death-like silence and a dread reposeHer gloomy presence saddens all the sceneShades evry flowr and darkens evry greenDeepens the murmur of the falling floodsAnd breathes a browner horror on the woods 
    Yet here for ever ever must I staySad proof how well a lover can obeyDeath only death can break the lasting chainAnd here evn then shall my cold dust remainHere all its frailties all its flames resignAnd wait till tis no sin to mix with thine 
    Ah wretch believd the spouse of God in vainConfessd within the slave of love and man Assist me Heavn but whence arose that prayrSprung it from piety or from despairEvn here where frozen chastity retiresLove finds an altar for forbidden fires I ought to grieve but cannot what I oughtI mourn the lover not lament the faultI view my crime but kindle at the viewRepent old pleasures and solicit newNow turnd to Heavn I weep my past offenceNow think of thee and curse my innocence Of all affliction taught a lover yetTis sure the hardest science to forgetHow shall I lose the sin yet keep the senseAnd love th offender yet detest th offenceHow the dear object from the crime removeOr how distinguish penitence from loveUnequal task a passion to resignFor hearts so touchd so piercd so lost as mine Ere such a soul regains its peaceful stateHow often must it love how often hateHow often hope despair resent regretConceal disdain do all things but forget But let Heavn seize it all at once tis firdNot touchd but rapt not wakend but inspirdOh come oh teach me nature to subdueRenounce my love my life myself and you Fill my fond heart with God alone for heAlone can rival can succeed to thee 
    How happy is the blameless vestals lotThe world forgetting by the world forgot Eternal sunshine of the spotless mindEach prayr accepted and each wish resigndLabour and rest that equal periods keepObedient slumbers that can wake and weepDesires composd affections ever evnTears that delight and sighs that waft to Heavn Grace shines around her with serenest beamsAnd whispring angels prompt her golden dreams For her th unfading rose of Eden bloomsAnd wings of seraphs shed divine perfumesFor her the Spouse prepares the bridal ringFor her white virgins hymeneals singTo sounds of heavnly harps she dies awayAnd melts in visions of eternal day 
    Far other dreams my erring soul employFar other raptures of unholy joyWhen at the close of each sad sorrowing dayFancy restores what vengeance snatchd awayThen conscience sleeps and leaving nature freeAll my loose soul unbounded springs to thee Oh cursd dear horrors of all-conscious nightHow glowing guilt exalts the keen delightProvoking Daemons all restraint removeAnd stir within me every source of love I hear thee view thee gaze oer all thy charmsAnd round thy phantom glue my clasping arms I wake no more I hear no more I viewThe phantom flies me as unkind as you I call aloud it hears not what I sayI stretch my empty arms it glides away To dream once more I close my willing eyesYe soft illusions dear deceits ariseAlas no more methinks we wandring goThrough dreary wastes and weep each others woeWhere round some mouldring tower pale ivy creepsAnd low-browd rocks hang nodding oer the deeps Sudden you mount you beckon from the skiesClouds interpose waves roar and winds arise I shriek start up the same sad prospect findAnd wake to all the griefs I left behind 
    For thee the fates severely kind ordainA cool suspense from pleasure and from painThy life a long dead calm of fixd reposeNo pulse that riots and no blood that glows Still as the sea ere winds were taught to blowOr moving spirit bade the waters flowSoft as the slumbers of a saint forgivnAnd mild as opening gleams of promisd heavn 
    Come Abelard for what hast thou to dreadThe torch of Venus burns not for the dead Nature stands checkd Religion disapprovesEvn thou art cold yet Eloisa loves Ah hopeless lasting flames like those that burnTo light the dead and warm th unfruitful urn 
    What scenes appear whereer I turn my viewThe dear ideas where I fly pursueRise in the grove before the altar riseStain all my soul and wanton in my eyes I waste the matin lamp in sighs for theeThy image steals between my God and meThy voice I seem in evry hymn to hearWith evry bead I drop too soft a tear When from the censer clouds of fragrance rollAnd swelling organs lift the rising soulOne thought of thee puts all the pomp to flightPriests tapers temples swim before my sightIn seas of flame my plunging soul is drowndWhile altars blaze and angels tremble round 
    While prostrate here in humble grief I lieKind virtuous drops just gathring in my eyeWhile praying trembling in the dust I rollAnd dawning grace is opning on my soulCome if thou darst all charming as thou artOppose thyself to Heavn dispute my heartCome with one glance of those deluding eyesBlot out each bright idea of the skiesTake back that grace those sorrows and those tearsTake back my fruitless penitence and prayrsSnatch me just mounting from the blest abodeAssist the fiends and tear me from my God
    No fly me fly me far as pole from poleRise Alps between us and whole oceans rollAh come not write not think not once of meNor share one pang of all I felt for thee Thy oaths I quit thy memory resignForget renounce me hate whateer was mine Fair eyes and tempting looks which yet I viewLong lovd adord ideas all adieuOh Grace serene oh virtue heavnly fairDivine oblivion of low-thoughted careFresh blooming hope gay daughter of the skyAnd faith our early immortalityEnter each mild each amicable guestReceive and wrap me in eternal rest
    See in her cell sad Eloisa spreadProppd on some tomb a neighbour of the dead In each low wind methinks a spirit callsAnd more than echoes talk along the walls Here as I watchd the dying lamps aroundFrom yonder shrine I heard a hollow sound Come sister come it said or seemd to sayThy place is here sad sister come awayOnce like thyself I trembled wept and praydLoves victim then though now a sainted maidBut all is calm in this eternal sleepHere grief forgets to groan and love to weepEvn superstition loses evry fearFor God not man absolves our frailties here 
    I come I come prepare your roseate bowrsCelestial palms and ever-blooming flowrs Thither where sinners may have rest I goWhere flames refind in breasts seraphic glowThou Abelard the last sad office payAnd smooth my passage to the realms of daySee my lips tremble and my eye-balls rollSuck my last breath and catch my flying soulAh no in sacred vestments mayst thou standThe hallowd taper trembling in thy handPresent the cross before my lifted eyeTeach me at once and learn of me to die Ah then thy once-lovd Eloisa seeIt will be then no crime to gaze on me See from my cheek the transient roses flySee the last sparkle languish in my eyeTill evry motion pulse and breath be oerAnd evn my Abelard be lovd no more O Death all-eloquent you only proveWhat dust we dote on when tis man we love 
    Then too when fate shall thy fair frame destroyThat cause of all my guilt and all my joyIn trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drowndBright clouds descend and angels watch thee roundFrom opning skies may streaming glories shineAnd saints embrace thee with a love like mine 
    May one kind grave unite each hapless nameAnd graft my love immortal on thy fameThen ages hence when all my woes are oerWhen this rebellious heart shall beat no moreIf ever chance two wandring lovers bringsTo Paracletes white walls and silver springsOer the pale marble shall they join their headsAnd drink the falling tears each other shedsThen sadly say with mutual pity movdOh may we never love as these have lovdFrom the full choir when loud Hosannas riseAnd swell the pomp of dreadful sacrificeAmid that scene if some relenting eyeGlance on the stone where our cold relics lieDevotions self shall steal a thought from HeavnOne human tear shall drop and be forgivn And sure if fate some future bard shall joinIn sad similitude of griefs to mineCondemnd whole years in absence to deploreAnd image charms he must behold no moreSuch if there be who loves so long so wellLet him our sad our tender story tellThe well-sung woes will soothe my pensive ghostHe best can paint em who shall feel em most
