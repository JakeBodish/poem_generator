
Today is Sunday I fear the crowd of my fellows with such faces of stone From my glass tower filled with headaches and impatient AncestorsI contemplate the roofs and hilltops in the mist In the stillness somber naked chimneys Below them my dead are asleep and my dreams turn to ashes All my dreams blood running freely down the streetsAnd mixing with blood from the butcher shops From this observatory like the outskirts of townI contemplate my dreams lost along the streetsCrouched at the foot of the hills like the guides of my raceOn the rivers of the Gambia and the SaloumAnd now on the Seine at the foot of these hills Let me remember my deadYesterday was All Saints’ Day the solemn anniversary of the SunAnd I had no dead to honor in any cemetery O Forefathers You who have always refused to dieWho knew how to resist Death from the Sine to the SeineAnd now in the fragile veins of my indomitable bloodGuard my dreams as you did your thin-legged migrant sonsO Ancestors Defend the roofs of Paris in this dominical fogThe roofs that protect my dead Let me leave this tower so dangerously secureAnd descend to the streets joining my brothersWho have blue eyes and hard hands
