
what thoughts I have of you tonight Du Bois
of bodies rocked and minds embalmed in bark
our blanched arrival seethin with scandals mark
nowadays I peep you in the bean-pie sellers poise
with that silhouette fit for bust or cameo
I cant always divine your debonair birth
or your boocoo brain laborin like an earth
in hallelujahs ether somehow duckin deaths blow
sure sprung from Imhoteps kundalini
stitchin white reconstructions funeral shroud
scriptin Philly dirges for the cryin out loud
cussin Garveys name over martinis
sometimes I wonder if you double agent on the page
or mastermind of our ordered rage
