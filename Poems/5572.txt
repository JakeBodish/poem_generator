
You are smaller than I rememberAnd so is the house set downhillAfloat in a sea of scrub oak  From up hereIt’s an ordinary box with gravelSpread over its lid weighting it butInside it’s full of shadows and sky Clouds pull themselves over dryGrass which if  I’m not mistaken will eruptAny minute in flame  Only A spark a sunbeam focused  From up Here enjoying the view I can finally Take you in  Will you wave back I keepSlingshotting around  There’s gravityFor you but all I ever wanted was to fly
