
this morning I went to the doctor
and talked to him about this move
 
on New Year’s Eve I had trouble connecting
my thoughts on Sade and reason
 
we rang in the New Year
with Miriam Makeba’s Africa
 
I’d noticed that my inner life
had expanded and that I was having trouble
 
thinking through it  The doctor said that Geodon
would loosen my thinking I noticed
 
that I’d been moving through life for 10 years
in a Zyprexa mold  thought control at its best
 
like a sonnet  I do not feel invaded
by the television that I never see  Brenda made me
 
feel more loved than ever this morning as my thoughts
expanded  Last night in the slow cooker I made
 
Lamb and Goat curry amazingly good  I’d thought
to send Joel and Peter and Michael an email
 
letting them know of my transition but did not  The consequences
of this transition could be catastrophic  I feel more loving toward Brenda
 
than ever  I could die or worse  As I meditated today
my books to the left of me seemed packed and dense
 
against the wall  Soon Chuck will be here
to play chess upstairs  I told the doctor this morning
 
that the philosophy and religion of the cyborg
have not yet been written  My
 
poetry
has just begun  I am
 
a Fourth Form
though not as Dodie saw it  Together
 
we can belong in this world  Artaud
arrived at the double
 
as I have  We share more in common
than I’d known before last night  I need less sleep
 
than before and I sleep better
and am more rested  I feel sad and cheated
 
that I need to rely on drugs
so completely  I wonder about Paul Bowles’ stories 
 
I need to reach out
to others
 
through this  The doctor this morning said
that I was enlightened but not
 
quite there somehow I can’t remember
how  I doubt he knows
 
what he means by “enlightenment ” I felt far away
from my sister yesterday when she called  Michael
 
talked to me of Christ’s
tenderness  I feel tender in this moment  Over
 
and over I feel that words
do not represent me  I am not
 
sure what that implies of my intentions
in using them  Yesterday Brenda and I saw
 
the Warhol show of the last ten years
of his life  There seemed to have been hope
 
to live meaningfully in capitalism then   The waves
of this beginning the new life of my mind
 
is settling  It’s been a while since I’ve written  I’ve decided
to mark my continuing with the seven tildes above  And I added
 
a title tonight Muerto Vecino after Zizek’s dubious interpretation
of Kierkegaard’s neighbor and because of the funeral home
 
across the street  My thinking has changed my being has changed
I am more alert and more engaged in thinking through the world 
 
And I am able to speak better  I don’t know what this means
about who I am  I try not to feel let down that for so much of my life
 
I’ve been restrained by psychotropic drugs  Before Zyprexa it was even
worse with up to 6 meds as I’ve said over and over to friends  I feel
 
the need to make clear what my obstacles have been  Not for pity
a little for pride but also for hope  If I can do that then maybe I can help
 
someone not suffer so much like Brenda  I replaced the kitchen faucet
this past weekend  It makes me very happy that I was able to do it
 
successfully without ever having been handy before in my life and after
spending most of my life disdainful of being practical in that way  What a joy
 
to make Brenda so happy  I don’t know how much longer I will live
and have often thought recently that it would be tragic if I died anytime
 
soon but that it’s imperative that I accept death when it arrives after
affirming life as fully as I can  It’s too easy and stupid to be simplistically
 
oppositional  And to not know that people can ruin anything but
that the substantial things have value of themselves is foolish  I don’t want to stop
 
at my own ignorance and lack of forbearance  I don’t believe in the West
on its own  As Michael says the only thing that makes sense here
 
is love  I have everything I could possibly ever want or need for now  More books
will come more music too  And love is immeasurable
 
when it’s real  I am so grateful to have more waking time
on the weekends  I plan on making breakfast for Brenda
 
every Saturday and Sunday that I can
from now on  Early  I see gardens in the future of our household 
 
And I wonder about a Great Spirit  What does the name matter I see the stones that live
without water  I see the smoke that cleanses my vision and a network of consciousness
 
with each node another on and on that way to the depths  My thinking will never
grasp it all
 
because of that recursively created network of interior life  My thinking stops
then barely able to contain the spherical and vast darkness
 
from which all light arises  That’s why what I see is dark  It is brilliant
in its darkness  Like onyx and flint  I can only talk around what I’ve seen
 
the past couple of weeks  It reframes completely the rest of my creative
life and the rest of my days  All I aim to do now is to focus my attention
 
so that I can see it all again in retrospect  So that I can read
and gather more tools for understanding it  So that I understand myself
 
and something of the world and love and so that I help others  Geodon
will not erase it  I’ve seen it already many times  It is my natural state 
 
I no longer see it as only hallucination  It is a way of being  A way that I can flesh
out here  Slowly  Carefully  And as I do its destructive powers
 
which are massive and righteous will subside  As it will know that it is being
given to the world  Because it belongs to all  And all will be there soon 
 
There are signs already  Because to see it is to break unless one knows something
of love  It makes LSD
 
small  It is God and the Universe as One 
I am not the first to see it  But I am a person
 
given a chance
to write it letter by letter slowly in terms of the light of my ignorance
 
to see more fully
what I do not know  I do not offer anything
 
but poems  But it breaks through
my mouth to arrive at the hearts of the world at the hearts of the horses
 
of the world to allow us all to speak in silence  It is not God or the Universe 
It is One as All in you  Because I cannot see through myself
 
without it  I see clearly
that the sun will not arrive
 
in this new weather  But that the moon
will take its place  I see clearly that the sun is there
 
to bring meaning to the sky and that the earth is more full
with the light of the world
 
extinguished for a brilliant view of wilderness  This is a view
that extends through opposites
 
and arrives at a single body
to witness this song  And this song is not the answer
 
that you believe in because one day
I will speak to you again
 
in the rain
and show you
 
that I do not know  Because knowledge
belongs to the earth  And the earth makes everything
 
I know  And now that there is less and less freedom
from coercion in a moneyed world and now that Claire
 
a friend is moving on to be Christ in her own way now
that Guénon continues to call me to understand
 
my ignorance to depart again
from the friends at Kuna Yala where I helped with the water
 
with Brenda watching over me
from a hammock between palms now that Panamá
 
calls again to give me a union
of the world in more than two ways
 
and to distinguish from the surface of these times I
receive
 
a call to awaken in the snow  I receive a call to acknowledge
that Geodon has planted itself
 
with capital
in my consciousness but that the world
 
is stronger than to balance itself
from the ozone and people alone  We are not erased and we
 
do not control the earth  Geodon
is an act of kindness an agreement
 
to live this life
in a way that arrives
 
with the weather  It may continue
for the rest of my life or it may not  I will not be afraid again
 
to see things as I do and I will not
seek out the truth intentionally without some kind of agreement
 
with this custom  Because that is a way for now
that I speak  And it is useful though better left
 
invisible  And the name Geodon brings trouble I can see
through it enough with enough love in my life to believe
 
in the end of the reign of the Anti-Christ not Obama  I need to learn again
to be and to write  But to deliver
 
what I saw
I must return
 
to the explosion of my inner life  To start with otherwise and generally I see
only outlines  Creation manifests
 
from every direction in an infinity
of dimensions  Most of us
 
spend most of our energy
conscious of a very few of these dimensions  Imagine
 
more than the greatest works of art
manifesting endlessly
 
from more directions than one can possibly count
every micro second timelessly  It’s glorious 
 
And the only way to see it with any balance
is impeccably ethically compassionately and with at least an aim
 
toward the Divine  It IS the Divine  God and the Universe
spoke to me  It is all always speaking to us  And what it says
 
is endless
it brings wholeness
 
to the precious moment  It goes away
when one tries to pin it down as I do  I say less and less
 
as I try to describe it  It is endlessly
generative  It is good
 
but pitiless and merciful  It demands of us
that we arrive  And now that the thinking manifests
 
in a way that allows
for union and a bridge in a way that avoids
 
easy condemnation a thinking that reveals
the links toward light
 
in motion a primordial
form of being
 
in a new world that needs no one
to believe in it a vast chasm
 
in what a bureaucracy of thought
tries to pin us down with the hole in time
 
that allows us to be free
is here we know it  All of us
 
can see through delusion  There is no road
in the aftermath of earthquakes no need for the time
 
to extinguish the elements no person
locked to your heart
 
in the morning no water to drink
without thirst no air is necessary to breathe
 
under the water of seeing no
need for the earth to do anything
 
other than revolve in this
new light  Space
 
undoes our links
to the immovable  We deliver
 
the undone to the plains
and see what the harvest
 
will fill with seed  The whole
does not exist
 
within outlines  All we can do
is move to it  The music
 
is unheard of
in this world  It exists
 
without origin  It is otherworldly
primordial and gentle  It vibrates
 
equally in the Lamb in
the Lotus in
 
the stones there is no place
unknown to it  It is
 
music and nothing more
and nothing less  It is that
 
everywhere possible  It is harmonious
infinitely and allows for any sound  To some
 
it might seem like noise but that
is only the part  To achieve it
 
one need only listen  I cannot always
hear it but I have
 
heard it  And now
in my new mind I listen for it
 
undaunted and silent  I feel it filling
my body with love  Sometimes
 
I have horrific thoughts  But I am learning
that these are but strong notes
 
in the fullness
of the music
 
of my new mind  I can’t always hear the song
but I feel it now  It makes all context
 
vast  I will receive it
as long as it is here  I will not push
 
one way or the other with it  It is a fullness
and does not want to be made
 
into a force  It is a force
without me and only to the degree
 
to which this is true  No longer being able
to receive it
 
will imply a failure
of my imagination of my ethics
 
and my spirit  There is no way
to hold on to it  It serves
 
no one  And it includes us all  To continue to receive it
more fully
 
I grow  This implies
the world  It implies clarity  It implies
 
motion  But it rests motionlessly  If I have a softness in my voice
it is caused by this music  When I don’t
 
I feel less  My voice can be loud
to receive it but this loudness
 
cannot be yoked
in outlines  There is nothing I can do 
 
There is nothing to expect  I can only
let it go  And I can only be afraid
 
of the horror of my thoughts
without this music  But now that I know
 
a taste of it I have
hope  Good people
 
feed it  I haven’t always known
what to do with it and others  But now
 
I am a little less confused
about this  This is due
 
to Buddhism the little that I know
of its practice  And to love  But it does not stop
 
at my experience  I am ignorant
and cannot offer knowledge  Except this
 
music
does not require knowledge  I’m not sure
 
what it requires  It requires
to be received but does not need us  Is there a pact
 
between humanity
and God I don’t know  Is there a God
 
I don’t know  I’m not sure the question
is enough on its own  Or maybe it is if God
 
is not limited by concept  And concept
seems to be only a note in this song  Problems
 
feed it  “Love
is the absence of fear ” And “love
 
believes all things
yet is never deceived ” I aim
 
to see through my delusions  I aim
to be one of many a small voice
 
in the song of the world  I rest
in silence
 
as I always have  “To have a view
as vast as the sky
 
and as fine
as a grain of sand ” All beings
 
want to be loved
and to be free
 
from suffering  We strive
diligently
 
to learn the vast expanse
and the laser pointed focus
 
of this gift  Remember that light
makes us  And that in this
 
new world more and more
is made of light  And if that is the case
 
we move to move
the light of the world  Someday
 
perhaps we will move
the light
 
of the computer world  Only the compassionate
and true
 
will be able to do so  Because only they
can be selfless enough
 
to let it move through them  I am not there
to move it
 
but I saw this  Long ago  Briefly  I was offered
a glimpse  It is utterly simple and beyond
 
thought  There is hope  Intention
is a thought  So one
 
sees  I cannot tangle
myself
 
in the line  But only to bridge  That is part of why
it will all move  But I cannot wait
 
until that is possible
to become  I can wait
 
eternally and actively in the world
to remain
 
still  With the calm and expansive
link
 
that allows us to live so preciously
together I see through
 
the trouble that startles me every moment
and allow the seeing
 
of my inner eye
to burn through it  I do not remember
 
what Zyprexa was like any longer  Except that it seems
I have more to work with now with my mind  And these
 
words are plain so as to be careful in this new place  I see
that they do not break open my heart as I read  And for that
 
I relinquish this poem and allow it to be only
a mark on the road to further inquiry  I allow it to see
 
as I have made a vow to bridge that my life
aims to be whole even in the face of potential
 
catastrophes I grow more and more
to accept death as it arrives to allow it to soften me
 
and to transform me as I have been transformed through Geodon only
to know that there is an isthmus and that it is eternal  Only that there is one
 
heart to allow myself to speak
in the storms of tribulation as one speaks
 
to allow the teamwork of the fabric of need
of the bird malingerer to see this
 
in the aftermath of one who has died  Like a bicycle never once
together enough to ride I see this word here again to the removal
 
of a people to the homeland of union and pace to the isthmus
of a double link one ocean to another one continent
 
to another to the only union even as it may be erased in my history the place
of one heart to allow the song to continue through conflict
 
as she saw it then one time far away when I hadn’t known yet that this
would be timeless  And there is one to it there to see it there to allow
 
it there to become and to see there as one is there to see
and to allow one to arrive with it there and to see and to be one with it
 
there as one is there to be with it  And to see there as one is there to believe
as it is one to believe it there
 
and to see it there as one with the soil and the air and the light and rain
and to be there with one to be there one with it there once again and to see it there
 
and to believe as there is one there to believe it there again and to see  And to see
there as one is there to believe as it is there again
 
and to see there as one is there to arrive and to be with it
there and to see it there once again and to see it there again
 
and to believe as there is one to it again and to see and to hold
and to see it there and to hold
 
being that nothing holds
