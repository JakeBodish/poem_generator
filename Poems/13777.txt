
What a fuckup you are    
What dumbshit you do    
Your fathers voice   
still whispers in you   
   
despite the joys   
that sweeten each day    
Your Genius it isnt   
until dying away   
   
it worms back through   
the sparkling dream   
where you drown him   
in an inch-deep stream   
   
your knee in his back   
your strength on his skull   
it begins singing   
praise for your skill
