
The stems of  the sun bent over the eye             The sleeping manThe whole of  the earth             And this head heavy with fearIn the nightThis complete hole                         VastAnd even so streaming with waterThe noise           The peals of  little bells mingled with the               Clinking of glasses                    And bursts of laughterThe head movesOn the carpet the body shiftsAnd turns over the warm spot                At the slipping feet of  the animalIt’s that they’re waiting                            For the summons of the shockAnd the signal of  the eyelidThe ray relaxes                           Sleep                                       LightAnd what is left shines at the edge of  the white rock
