
Tis death and peace indeed is hereAnd ease from shame and rest from fear Theres nothing can dismarble nowThe smoothness of that limpid brow But is a calm like this in truthThe crowning end of life and youthAnd when this boon rewards the deadAre all debts paid has all been saidAnd is the heart of youth so lightIts step so firm its eye so brightBecause on its hot brow there blowsA wind of promise and reposeFrom the far grave to which it goesBecause it hath the hope to comeOne day to harbour in the tombAh no the bliss youth dreams is oneFor daylight for the cheerful sunFor feeling nerves and living breath Youth dreams a bliss on this side death It dreams a rest if not more deepMore grateful than this marble sleepIt hears a voice within it tellCalms not lifes crown though calm is well Tis all perhaps which man acquiresBut tis not what our youth desires
