
Supervises over the teatable our voluble hostess
The passing round of titterings and toasties 
Her glass-eyed friends confidences make-and-breaks
Give each in series gobbets of anothers cakes 
Dough drips into their tight triangular shoes 
Their mouths give vent to evil-smelling news
Keep their minds pure make mental products crisper
With speaking eyeball rolls and the not too improper whisper 
Fawn-eyed the daughter a gossip apprentice
Festoons gilt malice on her unmalicious twenties 
Holiday smarmed the manureminded ephebus
Sees in every skirt lubricitys rebus 
Sex is their unknown god with neither purity nor pox
To whom they genuflect whenever they enjoy their shocks 
A little of everything is the note they strike
The only limitation what they think they do not like 
Always they suffer inexpressible injustices
Making their own beds these amateur Procrusteses
But expect their maids to lie in them  The middle classes
Must have some defence against the vulgar masses 
They have no use for idle gossips that scarify
But in their own leisure get together to verify
Rumours of rationalists use of contraceptives
Probable bastards hope of their proving defectives
Details being perquisites of good detectives 
This of course for the parishs sake  These long nose weevils
Seek knowledge of others as expression of their own evils
And naught escapes being twisted and messed
Their own souls included on matters of interest 
Ignorant superficial malignant self-deceived
Ashamed to bear but proud to be bereaved
Devoted to truths medals but dismayed to see its flesh 
Babies are born to them in prams and crêches 
Lip-honouring peace by their indignant whispers
Others they desecrate their own insure in their smug vespers 
At mattins for their own sins pray to be forgiven
Revelling in others while walking home from heaven 
Martrylike suffer for transgressions of the parish
Or say they do particularly the most garish 
But humbly at their bedside never hope that Jesus has destroyed
Others misfortunes wholly lest themselves be unemployed 
Such and so balsting are their faded Joys
Which Time nor Sickness never quite destroys 
Balder and balder every haircut
Cutting a caper as lewd as he dare cut
Quasiphilosophically Capricorn carouses
Ill at ease in such respectable houses
The disinherited soul of an atrabilious
Semi self-deprecating paterfamilias 
With many eyeglitters at womens legs in stockings
And at the schoolboys furtive corybantic eyecockings
His Bacchanalian belly he wobbles like a sack
with metaphysical justification as Dionysiac
And ungenteel jokes undoubtedly due to his strabismus
Distorting even the quaint festivities of Christmas 
Remembering in the artificial afternoon
Old days when Pan his saxophonic tune
Under the ilex played and how the figwood image
Nimbly swayed in the nights of lustful scrimmage
And how in pleased surprise he uttered several Eurekas
At finding the gross fungus Ithyphallus Impudicus 
With him his fathers hair his fathers scalp reveals
Commensurate with scratching too much during silent meals
With virgins blood the holly on the wall
Drips  As from Druid branches fail to fall
Light intense pearl juices from alabaster fitting
The proper tight-drawn hostess cuts unwitting
Symbols of fertility from Christmas cake  All jollity
Is fastened down  Only innocent frivolity
Saturnalia is allowed in houses of good quality 
Tiddledywog  Meh meh  The door bursts open wide
The Sunday china stands up horrified Tiddledywog  Meh meh  All he has ever remembered
Bulges out like a plaster panel badly distempered 
Tiddledywog  Meh membrum caprinum erexit
Culpabat alia aliam quia ipsa conspexit 
Tiddledywog  Tiddledywog  Tiddledywog 
First he puts under the mat Persian cat and Pekinese dog 
Then the tables and chairbacks torselling
Smashes and piles on potsherds of Worcester porcelain 
Tiddledywog  Tiddledywog  Forefeet dangling like clappers
Dancing about he grips the frightened flappers
Flaxen coils throws to the ground and violates her 
Which done she becomes he he hates her
And turning on the boy knocks his eyes out
Strips him and using sinewy tail as a knout
Flogs the boy till he eddies and faints  And the mother faints
Whom Capricorn props up upon the chintz
And bathing her forehead with cold milk and tea
Reverses coldness that used to be 
But when she recovers recovers himself and batters
The woman to death  This seems to mend matters 
Next pausing somewhat incommoded by his toils
The carpets cushions colour schemes he soils 
Last in fierce memory of dislocate desire
The house itself he dislocates with fire 
Scatters the redhot imitation coals
Over this mortuary of human souls 
The imitation furniture goes up in smoke
And well fired china serves as admirable coke 
Like wood distilled that dribbles clammily
Oozes the ectoplasm of his burning family 
Various vermicular disseminations
