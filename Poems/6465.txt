
When the puppy snarfles for breakfast
I wake to the radiator gurgling
then feet crunching the reticent snow 
Before I was born Mother sewed her own suits 
What do her ashes know
                                         •
Father shoved snow off the supine roof 
Mother crafted Christmas ornaments
glue and glitter and red balls 
No tinsel no angels 
Her death started in the living room 
                                         •
For bonsai pliers the size of a nail clipper
spools of wire and a fist-sized rock 
One bore a petite pomegranate
never to eat not to touch 
Her death began with a baseball bat 
                                         •
In the vineyard he secured the strongest cane
from training stake to fruiting wire 
Pruning with handsaw and lopper 
He’d leave a spur for the next season 
He shoved her away with direct objects 
                                         •
In a cold snap if one pipe freezes
the rest may freeze as well 
Even before the puppy snarfles 
Even before a baby brother arrived
in the misleading car in Mother’s arms                                          
                                         •
After the war after she met Father
she smoked cigarettes but didn’t cha-cha anymore 
She’d light up and blow smoke
out the apoplectic window 
He found the ashes on the sill 
                                         •
Fireflies blinked for mates or prey outside
the savvy window of my own first home 
On the stereo a bluesman criedI need my ashes hauled
The dress was too smart to wear 
                                         •
I tucked away our baby’s pink layette
in circumspect mothballs
for a christening that never took place 
As well a doll that Auntie crocheted 
More than anything I love tidal pools 
                                         •
I know her ashes are at Father’s lost
in his charnel of junk mail 
He claims that thieves have stolen that box
his knob cutter and root hook 
He says remains aren’t ashes anyways 
                                         •
Winter stripped everything to the limb
and dejected nest  No angels no crèche 
I don’t know whose recollections are suspect
after leaving Maui Mother learned to swim 
She loved tidal pools more than anything 
                                         •
In my kitchen the logs blink in the fire  
through blinds the wind blusters and
the browbeaten trees creak in the orchard 
The rain pours then stops for sun  If
he lost Mother’s ashes what more could I stand
                                         •Omusubi tastes best on black beaches 
Since Mother never learned to swim
did she watch her five brothers from a blanket
On the intransigent subway I don’t know if
I’ve passed my station  His mother said yes  
Iron I bit my lip again 
                                         •
Mother showed our baby how to sift flour
and how to crank an eggbeater 
After Father lost her
he barred everyone from the rooms and the yard
where at night long red worms
slither up from the ground 
                                         •
Her ashes know before the puppy snarfles
Father shoves snow off the supine roof
for bonsai use pliers the size of a nail clipper
in the vineyard the strongest canes
in a cold snap a hair dryer on frozen pipes
fireflies blinked for mates or prey outside
while I tucked away my baby’s pink layette 
Her ashes know their box is in the living room
where she didn’t cha-cha anymore 
Where has winter stripped everything to the nest
In my kitchen the logs blink in the fire and I knowomusubi tastes best on black beaches 
She knew to show her granddaughter how to sift flour
