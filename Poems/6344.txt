In the middle of that desert that didn’t look like sandand sand only
in the middle of those acacias whiptails and coyotes someone yelled“¡La Migra” and everyone ran 
In that dried creek where 40 of us slept we turned to each otherand you flew from my side in the dirt 
Black-throated sparrows and dawnhitting the tops of mesquites
beautifully  Against the herd of legsyou sprinted back toward me
I jumped on your shouldersand we ran from the white trucks  It was then the gun
ready to press its index I said “freeze Chino ¡pará por favor”
So I wouldn’t touch their legs that kicked youyou pushed me under your chest
and I’ve never thanked you 
Beautiful Chino   
the only name I know to call you by   farewell your tattooed chest
the M the S the 13  Farewellthe phone number you gave me
when you went east to Virginiaand I went west to San Francisco 
You called twice a monththen your cousin said the gang you ran from
in San Salvadorfound you in Alexandria  Farewell
your brown arms that shielded me thenthat shield me now from La Migra
