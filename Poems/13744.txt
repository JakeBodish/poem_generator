
I make the drive walk the corporate walk To do what I must and give what I got  I turn the chrome knob and I fill my slot  I talk and I joke a regular guy I input and output and rarely ask why  Its pasta and wine at home in my flat  Its voice mail and e-mail then feed the stray cat  Sometimes I go out and chat up the girls  Some want to tango some manage a smile  Some come home and have safe sex for a while  My sweet IRA my 401-k Let me buy tickets to games to a play  I go with the gang and dont get involved  I fly to St  Croix and stare at the sea  I travel first class  No day-tripper me  My stocks are diverse to ride out the storm  I buy what is solid hew to the norm  My portfolio teaches how I should vote  Im cautious in style suspicious of trend  When weather turns foul I always come in  This is my choice my new BoBo life  A two-career marriage the tension the strife  It didnt last long  We parted as pals  She got the condo  I got the car  Shes a savvy cool chick  Shell go really far  My folks live upstate where I misspent my youth  Theyre tight with their money and long in the tooth  When I visit its hard with so little to say  They miss me they claim  They worry  They pray  But they seem relieved when I drive away
