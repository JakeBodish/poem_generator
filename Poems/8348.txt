
A huge sound waits bound in the ice
in the icicle roots in the buds of snow
on fir branches in the falling silence
of snow glittering in the sun brilliant
as a swarm of gnats nothing but hovering
wings at midday  With the sun comes noise 
Tongues of ice break free fall shatter
splinter speak  If I could write the words 
Simple like turning a page to say Write
what happened
