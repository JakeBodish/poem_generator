
I come from Inuit oil money
From instruments of chance and divination 
The most loose shut in wavering mind
Recording my day with recitations antennae
Narration and figure my phone might die  Im walking dirty 
Shop and mob cops not to touch my mothers breast
Or the queens royal crown signature
Izzy Juju hijacked forsaking all others 
The untamed scotch is mine  It cost the picture a fortune
To say nothing of my turban costume copies
Of topaz bracelets the umpteenth translation 
Did you ever know Micah Gay Sunshine Grace Cathedral Coconut
I went from heels at Barneys to the depths of the bins 
Who could be like dropping in Ill fold both my hands
In gloves and wait Hope Diamond peeking out
