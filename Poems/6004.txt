my first venture west was in Windows 98or Independence Missouri  class in the computer lab we were supposed to be playing some typing gameor another  the one i remember had a haunted theme ghosts instructing us on the finer points of where to put our fingers  these were the last days before keyboards as appendage when typing was not nature  i should’ve been letting an apparition coach me through QWERTY but rather i was at the general store deciding between ammo  axlesconsidering the merits of being a banker or carpenter too young to know what profession would get me to the Willamette Valley in the space of a 40-minute period  i aimed my rifle with the arrow keys tapped the spacebar with a prayer for meat to haul back to the wagon this game came difficult as breathing underwater aftertrying to ford a river                                          i was no good at survival somebody always fell ill or out into the river each new day scurvy or a raid was the fate of a characternamed for my crush or my baby sister this loss i know how to measure what it meansto die premature before a school period ends i can’t understand the game coming to a late end  an elderly daughter grieving her elderly mother  reading the expansive obit in a suburban Detroit church is a confusing newness when the old do the thing the world expectsi retreat into my former self  focus on beatingvideo games I’ve always sucked at brush upon Chicago Bulls history re-memorizethe Backstreet Boys catalog push away whatever woman is foolhardy enough to be on any road with me  i pioneer my way awayfrom all the known world  i look at homicide rates  wish we all expired the way i know best  i prayfor a senseless poetic departure  i pray for my familyto not be around to miss me while i’m still here i want a short obituary a life brief  unfulfilledthe introductory melody before a beat’s crescendo into songthe game over somewhere in the Great Plains i want to spare my descendants the confusionof watching a flame flicker slow  keep them from beingat a funeral thumbing the faded family pictures like worn keysobserving the journey done the game won the westconquered
