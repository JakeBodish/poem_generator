
O call not me to justify the wrongThat thy unkindness lays upon my heartWound me not with thine eye but with thy tongueUse power with power and slay me not by art Tell me thou lov’st elsewhere but in my sight Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye asideWhat need’st thou wound with cunning when thy mightIs more than my o’erpressed defense can bideLet me excuse thee ah my love well knowsHer pretty looks have been mine enemiesAnd therefore from my face she turns my foesThat they elsewhere might dart their injuries     Yet do not so but since I am near slain    Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
