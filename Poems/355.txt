
Because the only view we have is the one
that looks down on the knees  Praise perspective 
Praise shared disdain  Praise space made by connective
tissue the synaptic cleft elbowroom
at the dinner table polite conversation
lies you push through your teeth  Because dissecting
a dogs heart wont change the way it thinks  Praise redirected
traffic  Praise the gnarled lip that defends
the gentle bones  Because your mother was
a seahorse  And to think of her thin is
to empty all the ice from the tea glasses
to strain the soup by driving it through your hand 
Praise tablecloths sway-back chairs the plastic
folds that protect slice after slice of cheese
