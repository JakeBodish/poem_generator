The bar in the commuter stationThe Title The Northeast Corridor In his book The Art of Attention A Poet’s Eye 2007 Revell called it “a title taken from newspeak and describing that cindery ganglion of railways between Boston to the north and D C  to the southern end ” The term is used today by Amtrak  steams
like a ruin its fourth wall open
to the crowd and the fluttering timetables 
In the farthest corner the television
crackles a torch songtorch song A sad or sentimental love song and a beaded gown 
She is my favorite singer dead when I was born 
And I have been waiting for hours for a train
exhausted between connections to small cities
awake only in my eyes finding shelter
in the fluttering ribbon of shadow
around the dead woman singing on the screen 
Exhaustion is a last line of defense
where time either stops dead or kills you 
It teaches you to see what your eyes see
without questions without the politics
of living in one city dying in another 
How badly I would like to sleep now
in the shadows beside real things or beside
things that were real once like the beaded gown
on the television like the debut
of a song in New York in black and white
when my parents were there  I feel sometimes
my life was used up before I was born 
My eyes searsear  To burn to whither or to dry up backwards into my head
to the makeshift of what I have already seen
or heard described or dreamed about too weary

The dark rhombusrhombus A four-sided shape like a parallelogram  The window is shaped like a diamond on its side  See Wikipedia  of a window of a train

on the awakening body of a landscape

steaming and high-shouldered as the nineteen-forties 
The world exhaustsexhausts Used here in both senses to tire and to expel exhaust everything except my eyes
because it is a long walk to the world
begun before I was born  In the far corner
the dead woman bows off stage  The television   crumples into a white dotcrumples into a white dot Older tube televisions when turned off would have its picture quickly dissolve into a small white dot in the center of the screen as the last
train of the evening my train is announced 
I lived in one place  I want to die in another
