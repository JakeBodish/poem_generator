
When the hour is hushed and you lie stillSo quiet is the room about meIt seems perhaps that you are goneSunken to a marble sleep I hear no sound my quiet willPassive as the lambs at restStirs not the quaint forgetfulnessBut only murmurs “Sleep is strange”The low moon at the lattice goingRests no more quietly than you at peace Hushed is the candle the hour is lateAnd I poor witness of extreme changeI think perhaps then heaven opensLike the unfolding of your hand in sleep Your cold white hand to close again While I sit staring at the marble gate
