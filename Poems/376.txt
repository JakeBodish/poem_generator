 blocking my life my scenesin whichever stage direction she wants 
 Sometimes at night I can feel her dialing into meher ringing calls like an imperial decree 
 When she sleeps she crashes like a carinto the guardrail of my ambition 
 Her curse like a poison I cannot smellan asphyxiation of the self by the self that hell and hard sell 
 Split personalities we dream through the nightof our merger and acquisition in her half-moon light
 Not even my husband can feelher there between us a secret contract under seal 
 When I awaken her irises touch minean awful indecipherable fault line 
 She’s a character in search of an author a devoteetrying to recount her history through me
 until I channel her  She’s like a phantom limbhymn to the invisible  Her shameless whims
 the subtext of my lies  Under her tinted hairthe forest murmurs becomes a thought or prayer 
 Until her thoughts tumble into minecolors bleed  In the morning I’m overwrought 
 My patrilineal kin she begins to wear thinwhen she undoes hospital corners I’ve tucked so gently in 
 Her cool white rising is meringue completing the high-pitched silence of our congealing 
 She was always ceremonially unfoldinghis white shirts unpressing the folds
 in my circumstance  I did and didn’t want her  I kepttrying to catch her then let her slip  Any intent
 to have her near made her more invisible  Her electricbreasts overfilled my brassieres  An interaction our dialectic 
 She never removes her hat upon entering the doorto my personality  Ma semblable ma soeur
