sighs now breathd Unutterable which the Spirit of prayer Inspird and wingd for Heavn with speedier flight Then loudest Oratorie yet thir port Not of mean suiters nor important less Seemd thir Petition then when th ancient Pair In Fables old less ancient yet then these Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore The Race of Mankind drownd before the Shrine Of Themis stood devout  To Heavn thir prayers Flew up nor missd the way by envious windes Blown vagabond or frustrate in they passd Dimentionless through Heavnly dores then clad With incense where the Golden Altar fumd By thir great Intercessor came in sight Before the Fathers Throne Them the glad Son Presenting thus to intercede began  See Father what first fruits on Earth are sprung From thy implanted Grace in Man these Sighs And Prayers which in this Golden Censer mixt With Incense I thy Priest before thee bring Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed Sown with contrition in his heart then those Which his own hand manuring all the Trees Of Paradise could have product ere falln From innocence  Now therefore bend thine eare To supplication heare his sighs though mute Unskilful with what words to pray Iet mee Interpret for him mee his Advocate And propitiation all his works on mee Good or not good ingraft my Merit those Shall perfet and for these my Death shall pay  Accept me and in mee from these receave The smell of peace toward Mankinde let him live Before thee reconcild at least his days Numberd though sad till Death his doom which I To mitigate thus plead not to reverse To better life shall yeeld him where with mee All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss Made one with me as I with thee am one  To whom the Father without Cloud serene  All thy request for Man accepted Son Obtain all thy request was my Decree But longer in that Paradise to dwell The Law I gave to Nature him forbids Those pure immortal Elements that know No gross no unharmoneous mixture foule Eject him tainted now and purge him off As a distemper gross to aire as gross And mortal food as may dispose him best For dissolution wrought by Sin that first Distemperd all things and of incorrupt Corrupted  I at first with two fair gifts Created him endowd with Happiness And Immortalitie that fondly lost This other servd but to eternize woe Till I provided Death so Death becomes His final remedie and after Life Trid in sharp tribulation and refind By Faith and faithful works to second Life Wakt in the renovation of the just Resignes him up with Heavn and Earth renewd  But let us call to Synod all the Blest Through Heavns wide bounds from them I will not hide My judgments how with Mankind I proceed As how with peccant Angels late they saw And in thir state though firm stood more confirmd  He ended and the Son gave signal high To the bright Minister that watchd hee blew His Trumpet heard in Oreb since perhaps When God descended and perhaps once more To sound at general Doom  Th Angelic blast Filld all the Regions from thir blissful Bowrs Of Amarantin Shade Fountain or Spring By the waters of Life where ere they sate In fellowships of joy the Sons of Light Hasted resorting to the Summons high And took thir Seats till from his Throne supream Th Almighty thus pronouncd his sovran Will  O Sons like one of us Man is become To know both Good and Evil since his taste Of that defended Fruit but let him boast His knowledge of Good lost and Evil got Happier had it sufficd him to have known Good by it self and Evil not at all  He sorrows now repents and prayes contrite My motions in him longer then they move His heart I know how variable and vain Self-left  Least therefore his now bolder hand Reach also of the Tree of Life and eat And live for ever dream at least to live For ever to remove him I decree And send him from the Garden forth to Till The Ground whence he was taken fitter soile  Michael this my behest have thou in charge Take to thee from among the Cherubim Thy choice of flaming Warriours least the Fiend Or in behalf of Man or to invade Vacant possession som new trouble raise Hast thee and from the Paradise of God Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair From hallowd ground th unholie and denounce To them and to thir Progenie from thence Perpetual banishment  Yet least they faint At the sad Sentence rigorously urgd For I behold them softnd and with tears Bewailing thir excess all terror hide  If patiently thy bidding they obey Dismiss them not disconsolate reveale To Adam what shall come in future dayes As I shall thee enlighten intermix My Covnant in the womans seed renewd So send them forth though sorrowing yet in peace And on the East side of the Garden place Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes Cherubic watch and of a Sword the flame Wide waving all approach farr off to fright And guard all passage to the Tree of Life Least Paradise a receptacle prove To Spirits foule and all my Trees thir prey With whose stoln Fruit Man once more to delude  He ceasd and th Archangelic Power prepard For swift descent with him the Cohort bright Of watchful Cherubim four faces each Had like a double Janus all thir shape Spangld with eyes more numerous then those Of Argus and more wakeful then to drouze Charmd with Arcadian Pipe the Pastoral Reed Of Hermes or his opiate Rod  Mean while To resalute the World with sacred Light Leucothea wakd and with fresh dews imbalmd The Earth when Adam and first Matron Eve Had ended now thir Orisons and found Strength added from above new hope to spring Out of despaire joy but with fear yet linkt Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewd  Eve easily may Faith admit that all The good which we enjoy from Heavn descends But that from us ought should ascend to Heavn So prevalent as to concerne the mind Of God high-blest or to incline his will Hard to belief may seem yet this will Prayer Or one short sigh of humane breath up-borne Evn to the Seat of God  For since I saught By Prayer th offended Deitie to appease Kneeld and before him humbld all my heart Methought I saw him placable and mild Bending his eare perswasion in me grew That I was heard with favour peace returnd Home to my Brest and to my memorie His promise that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe Which then not minded in dismay yet now Assures me that the bitterness of death Is past and we shall live  Whence Haile to thee Eve rightly calld Mother of all Mankind Mother of all things living since by thee Man is to live and all things live for Man  To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek  Ill worthie I such title should belong To me transgressour who for thee ordaind A help became thy snare to mee reproach Rather belongs distrust and all dispraise But infinite in pardon was my Judge That I who first brought Death on all am gract The sourse of life next favourable thou Who highly thus to entitle me voutsafst Farr other name deserving  But the Field To labour calls us now with sweat imposd Though after sleepless Night for see the Morn All unconcernd with our unrest begins Her rosie progress smiling let us forth I never from thy side henceforth to stray Wherere our days work lies though now enjoind Laborious till day droop while here we dwell What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes Here let us live though in falln state content  So spake so wishd much-humbld Eve but Fate Subscribd not Nature first gave Signs imprest On Bird Beast Aire Aire suddenly eclipsd After short blush of Morn nigh in her sight The Bird of Jove stoopt from his aerie tour Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods First hunter then pursud a gentle brace Goodliest of all the Forrest Hart and Hinde Direct to th Eastern Gate was bent thir flight  Adam observd and with his Eye the chase Pursuing not unmovd to Eve thus spake  O Eve some furder change awaits us nigh Which Heavn by these mute signs in Nature shews Forerunners of his purpose or to warn Us haply too secure of our discharge From penaltie because from death releast Some days how long and what till then our life Who knows or more then this that we are dust And thither must return and be no more  Why else this double object in our fight Of flight pursud in th Air and ore the ground One way the self-same hour why in the East Darkness ere Dayes mid-course and Morning light More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws Ore the blew Firmament a radiant white And slow descends with somthing heavnly fraught  He errd not for by this the heavnly Bands Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now In Paradise and on a Hill made alt A glorious Apparition had not doubt And carnal fear that day dimmd Adams eye  Not that more glorious when the Angels met Jacob in Mahanaim where he saw The field Paviliond with his Guardians bright Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd In Dothan coverd with a Camp of Fire Against the Syrian King who to surprize One man Assassin-like had levied Warr Warr unproclamd  The Princely Hierarch In thir bright stand there left his Powers to seise Possession of the Garden hee alone To find where Adam shelterd took his way Not unperceavd of Adam who to Eve While the great Visitant approachd thus spake  Eve now expect great tidings which perhaps Of us will soon determin or impose New Laws to be observd for I descrie From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill One of the heavnly Host and by his Gate None of the meanest some great Potentate Or of the Thrones above such Majestie Invests him coming yet not terrible That I should fear nor sociably mild As Raphael that I should much confide But solemn and sublime whom not to offend With reverence I must meet and thou retire  He ended and th Arch-Angel soon drew nigh Not in his shape Celestial but as Man Clad to meet Man over his lucid Armes A militarie Vest of purple flowd Livelier then Meliboean or the graine Of Sarra worn by Kings and Heros old In time of Truce lris had dipt the wooff His starrie Helme unbuckld shewd him prime In Manhood where Youth ended by his side As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword Satans dire dread and in his hand the Spear  Adam bowd low hee Kingly from his State Inclind not but his coming thus declard  Adam Heavns high behest no Preface needs Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard and Death Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress Defeated of his seisure many dayes Givn thee of Grace wherein thou mayst repent And one bad act with many deeds well done Mayst cover well may then thy Lord appeasd Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claime But longer in this Paradise to dwell Permits not to remove thee I am come And send thee from the Garden forth to till The ground whence thou wast takn fitter Soile  He added not for Adam at the newes Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood That all his senses bound Eve who unseen Yet all had heard with audible lament Discoverd soon the place of her retire  O unexpected stroke worse then of Death Must I thus leave thee Paradise thus leave Thee Native Soile these happie Walks and Shades Fit haunt of Gods where I had hope to spend Quiet though sad the respit of that day That must be mortal to us both  O flours That never will in other Climate grow My early visitation and my last At Eevn which I bred up with tender hand From the first opning bud and gave ye Names Who now shall reare ye to the Sun or ranke Your Tribes and water from th ambrosial Fount Thee lastly nuptial Bowre by mee adornd With what to sight or smell was sweet from thee How shall I part and whither wander down Into a lower World to this obscure And wilde how shall we breath in other Aire Less pure accustomd to immortal Fruits Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde  Lament not Eve but patiently resigne What justly thou hast lost nor set thy heart Thus over-fond on that which is not thine Thy going is not lonely with thee goes Thy Husband him to follow thou art bound Where he abides think there thy native soile  Adam by this from the cold sudden damp Recovering and his scatterd spirits returnd To Michael thus his humble words addressd  Celestial whether among the Thrones or namd Of them the Highest for such of shape may seem Prince above Princes gently hast thou tould Thy message which might else in telling wound And in performing end us what besides Of sorrow and dejection and despair Our frailtie can sustain thy tidings bring Departure from this happy place our sweet Recess and onely consolation left Familiar to our eyes all places else Inhospitable appeer and desolate Nor knowing us nor known and if by prayer Incessant I could hope to change the will Of him who all things can I would not cease To wearie him with my assiduous cries But prayer against his absolute Decree No more availes then breath against the winde Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth Therefore to his great bidding I submit  This most afflicts me that departing hence As from his face I shall be hid deprivd His blessed countnance here I could frequent With worship place by place where he voutsafd Presence Divine and to my Sons relate On this Mount he appeerd under this Tree Stood visible among these Pines his voice I heard here with him at this Fountain talkd So many grateful Altars I would reare Of grassie Terfe and pile up every Stone Of lustre from the brook in memorie Or monument to Ages and thereon Offer sweet smelling Gumms and Fruits and Flours In yonder nether World where shall I seek His bright appearances or foot-step trace For though I fled him angrie yet recalld To life prolongd and promisd Race I now Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts Of glory and farr off his steps adore  To whom thus Michael with regard benigne  Adam thou knowst Heavn his and all the Earth  Not this Rock onely his Omnipresence fills Land Sea and Aire and every kinde that lives Fomented by his virtual power and warmd All th Earth he gave thee to possess and rule No despicable gift surmise not then His presence to these narrow bounds confind Of Paradise or Eden this had been Perhaps thy Capital Seate from whence had spred All generations and had hither come From all the ends of th Earth to celebrate And reverence thee thir great Progenitor  But this praeeminence thou hast lost brought down To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in plaine God is as here and will be found alike Present and of his presence many a signe Still following thee still compassing thee round With goodness and paternal Love his Face Express and of his steps the track Divine  Which that thou mayst beleeve and be confirmd Ere thou from hence depart know I am sent To shew thee what shall come in future dayes To thee and to thy Ofspring good with bad Expect to hear supernal Grace contending With sinfulness of Men thereby to learn True patience and to temper joy with fear And pious sorrow equally enurd By moderation either state to beare Prosperous or adverse so shalt thou lead Safest thy life and best prepard endure Thy mortal passage when it comes  Ascend This Hill let Eve for I have drencht her eyes Here sleep below while thou to foresight wakst As once thou slepst while Shee to life was formd  To whom thus Adam gratefully replid  Ascend I follow thee safe Guide the path Thou leadst me and to the hand of Heavn submit However chastning to the evil turne My obvious breast arming to overcom By suffering and earne rest from labour won If so I may attain    So both ascend In the Visions of God It was a Hill Of Paradise the highest from whose top The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken Stretcht out to the amplest reach of prospect lay  Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round Whereon for different cause the Tempter set Our second Adam in the Wilderness To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory  His Eye might there command wherever stood City of old or modern Fame the Seat Of mightiest Empire from the destind Walls Of Cambalu seat of Cathaian Can And Samarchand by Oxus Temirs Throne To Paquin of Sinaean Kings and thence To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul Down to the golden Chersonese or where The Persian in Ecbatan sate or since In Hispahan or where the Russian Ksar In Mosco or the Sultan in Bizance Turchestan-born nor could his eye not ken Th Empire of Negus to his utmost Port Ercoco and the less Maritim Kings Mombaza and Quiloa and Melind And Sofala thought Ophir to the Realme Of Congo and Angola fardest South Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount The Kingdoms of Almansor Fez and Sus Marocco and Algiers and Tremisen On Europe thence and where Rome was to sway The World in Spirit perhaps he also saw Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume And Cusco in Peru the richer seat Of Atabalipa and yet unspoild Guiana whose great Citie Geryons Sons Call El Dorado but to nobler sights Michael from Adams eyes the Filme removd Which that false Fruit that promisd clearer sight Had bred then purgd with Euphrasie and Rue The visual Nerve for he had much to see And from the Well of Life three drops instilld  So deep the power of these Ingredients piercd Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight That Adam now enforct to close his eyes Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst But him the gentle Angel by the hand Soon raisd and his attention thus recalld  Adam now ope thine eyes and first behold Th effects which thy original crime hath wrought In some to spring from thee who never touchd Th excepted Tree nor with the Snake conspird Nor sinnd thy sin yet from that sin derive Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds  His eyes he opnd and beheld a field Part arable and tilth whereon were Sheaves New reapt the other part sheep-walks and foulds Ith midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood Rustic of grassie sord thither anon A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought First Fruits the green Eare and the yellow Sheaf Unculld as came to hand a Shepherd next More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock Choicest and best then sacrificing laid The Inwards and thir Fat with Incense strewd On the cleft Wood and all due Rites performd  His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heavn Consumd with nimble glance and grateful steame The others not for his was not sincere Whereat hee inlie ragd and as they talkd Smote him into the Midriff with a stone That beat out life he fell and deadly pale Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effusd  Much at that sight was Adam in his heart Dismaid and thus in haste to th Angel crid  O Teacher some great mischief hath befalln To that meek man who well had sacrificd Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid T whom Michael thus hee also movd replid  These two are Brethren Adam and to come Out of thy loyns th unjust the just hath slain For envie that his Brothers Offering found From Heavn acceptance but the bloodie Fact Will be avengd and th others Faith approvd Loose no reward though here thou see him die Rowling in dust and gore    To which our Sire  Alas both for the deed and for the cause But have I now seen Death Is this the way I must return to native dust O sight Of terrour foul and ugly to behold Horrid to think how horrible to feel To whom thus Michael  Death thou hast seen In his first shape on man but many shapes Of Death and many are the wayes that lead To his grim Cave all dismal yet to sense More terrible at th entrance then within  Some as thou sawst by violent stroke shall die By Fire Flood Famin by Intemperance more In Meats and Drinks which on the Earth shall bring Diseases dire of which a monstrous crew Before thee shall appear that thou mayst know What miserie th inabstinence of Eve Shall bring on men    Immediately a place Before his eyes appeard sad noysom dark A Lazar-house it seemd wherein were laid Numbers of all diseasd all maladies Of gastly Spasm or racking torture qualmes Of heart-sick Agonie all feavorous kinds Convulsions Epilepsies fierce Catarrhs Intestin Stone and Ulcer Colic pangs Daemoniac Phrenzie moaping Melancholie And Moon-struck madness pining Atrophie Marasmus and wide-wasting Pestilence Dropsies and Asthmas and Joint-racking Rheums  Dire was the tossing deep the groans despair Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch And over them triumphant Death his Dart Shook but delaid to strike though oft invokt With vows as thir chief good and final hope  Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long Drie-eyd behold Adam could not but wept Though not of Woman born compassion quelld His best of Man and gave him up to tears A space till firmer thoughts restraind excess And scarce recovering words his plaint renewd  O miserable Mankind to what fall Degraded to what wretched state reservd Better end heer unborn  Why is life givn To be thus wrested from us rather why Obtruded on us thus who if we knew What we receive would either not accept Life offerd or soon beg to lay it down Glad to be so dismist in peace  Can thus Th Image of God in man created once So goodly and erect though faultie since To such unsightly sufferings be debast Under inhuman pains Why should not Man Retaining still Divine similitude In part from such deformities be free And for his Makers Image sake exempt Thir Makers Image   answerd Michael then Forsook them when themselves they villifid To serve ungovernd appetite and took His Image whom they servd a brutish vice Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve  Therefore so abject is thir punishment Disfiguring not Gods likeness but thir own Or if his likeness by themselves defact While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules To loathsom sickness worthily since they Gods Image did not reverence in themselves  I yield it just   said Adam   and submit  But is there yet no other way besides These painful passages how we may come To Death and mix with our connatural dust There is   said Michael   if thou well observe The rule of not too much by temperance taught In what thou eatst and drinkst seeking from thence Due nourishment not gluttonous delight Till many years over thy head return So maist thou live till like ripe Fruit thou drop Into thy Mothers lap or be with ease Gatherd not harshly pluckt for death mature This is old age but then thou must outlive Thy youth thy strength thy beauty which will change To witherd weak and gray thy Senses then Obtuse all taste of pleasure must forgoe To what thou hast and for the Aire of youth Hopeful and cheerful in thy blood will reigne A Melancholy damp of cold and dry To weigh thy Spirits down and last consume The Balme of Life    To whom our Ancestor  Henceforth I flie not Death nor would prolong Life much bent rather how I may be quit Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge Which I must keep till my appointed day Of rendring up and patiently attend My dissolution    Michael replid  Nor love thy Life nor hate but what thou livst Live well how long or short permit to Heavn And now prepare thee for another sight  He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine whereon Were Tents of various hue by some were herds Of Cattel grazing others whence the sound Of Instruments that made melodious chime Was heard of Harp and Organ and who moovd Thir stops and chords was seen his volant touch Instinct through all proportions low and high Fled and pursud transverse the resonant fugue  In other part stood one who at the Forge Labouring two massie clods of Iron and Brass Had melted whether found where casual fire Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale Down to the veins of Earth thence gliding hot To som Caves mouth or whether washt by stream From underground the liquid Ore he dreind Into fit moulds prepard from which he formd First his own Tooles then what might else be wrought Fusil or gravn in mettle  After these But on the hether side a different sort From the high neighbouring Hills which was thir Seat Down to the Plain descended by thir guise Just men they seemd and all thir study bent To worship God aright and know his works Not hid nor those things last which might preserve Freedom and Peace to men they on the Plain Long had not walkt when from the Tents behold A Beavie of fair Women richly gay In Gems and wanton dress to the Harp they sung Soft amorous Ditties and in dance came on The Men though grave eyd them and let thir eyes Rove without rein till in the amorous Net Fast caught they likd and each his liking chose And now of love they treat till th Eevning Star Loves Harbinger appeerd then all in heat They light the Nuptial Torch and bid invoke Hymen then first to marriage Rites invokt With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound  Such happy interview and fair event Of love and youth not lost Songs Garlands Flours And charming Symphonies attachd the heart Of Adam soon enclind to admit delight The bent of Nature which he thus expressd  True opener of mine eyes prime Angel blest Much better seems this Vision and more hope Of peaceful dayes portends then those two past Those were of hate and death or pain much worse Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends  To whom thus Michael  Judg not what is best By pleasure though to Nature seeming meet Created as thou art to nobler end Holie and pure conformitie divine  Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant were the Tents Of wickedness wherein shall dwell his Race Who slew his Brother studious they appere Of Arts that polish Life Inventers rare Unmindful of thir Maker though his Spirit Taught them but they his gifts acknowledgd none  Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget For that fair femal Troop thou sawst that seemd Of Goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay Yet empty of all good wherein consists Womans domestic honour and chief praise Bred onely and completed to the taste Of lustful appetence to sing to dance To dress and troule the Tongue and roule the Eye  To these that sober Race of Men whose lives Religious titld them the Sons of God Shall yield up all thir vertue all thir fame Ignobly to the traines and to the smiles Of these fair Atheists and now swim in joy Erelong to swim at large and laugh for which The world erelong a world of tears must weepe  To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft  O pittie and shame that they who to live well Enterd so faire should turn aside to tread Paths indirect or in the mid way faint But still I see the tenor of Mans woe Holds on the same from Woman to begin  From Mans effeminate slackness it begins Said th Angel who should better hold his place By wisdome and superiour gifts receavd  But now prepare thee for another Scene  He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred Before him Towns and rural works between Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs Concours in Arms fierce Faces threatning Warr Giants of mightie Bone and bould emprise Part wield thir Arms part courb the foaming Steed Single or in Array of Battel rangd Both Horse and Foot nor idely mustring stood One way a Band select from forage drives A herd of Beeves faire Oxen and faire Kine From a fat Meddow ground or fleecy Flock Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine Thir Bootie scarce with Life the Shepherds flye But call in aide which makes a bloody Fray With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine Where Cattle pasturd late now scatterd lies With Carcasses and Arms th ensanguind Field Deserted Others to a Citie strong Lay Seige encampt by Batterie Scale and Mine Assaulting others from the wall defend With Dart and Javlin Stones and sulfurous Fire On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds  In other part the scepterd Haralds call To Council in the Citie Gates anon Grey-headed men and grave with Warriours mixt Assemble and Harangues are heard but soon In factious opposition till at last Of middle Age one rising eminent In wise deport spake much of Right and Wrong Of Justice of Religion Truth and Peace And Judgment from above him old and young Exploded and had seizd with violent hands Had not a Cloud descending snatchd him thence Unseen amid the throng so violence Proceeded and Oppression and Sword-Law Through all the Plain and refuge none was found  Adam was all in tears and to his guide Lamenting turnd full sad O what are these Deaths Ministers not Men who thus deal Death Inhumanly to men and multiply Ten thousandfould the sin of him who slew His Brother for of whom such massacher Make they but of thir Brethren men of men But who was that Just Man whom had not Heavn Rescud had in his Righteousness bin lost To whom thus Michael  These are the product Of those ill mated Marriages thou sawst Where good with bad were matcht who of themselves Abhor to joyn and by imprudence mixt Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind  Such were these Giants men of high renown For in those dayes Might onely shall be admird And Valour and Heroic Vertu calld To overcome in Battle and subdue Nations and bring home spoils with infinite Man-slaughter shall be held the highest pitch Of human Glorie and for Glorie done Of triumph to be styld great Conquerours Patrons of Mankind Gods and Sons of Gods Destroyers rightlier calld and Plagues of men  Thus Fame shall be atchievd renown on Earth And what most merits fame in silence hid  But hee the seventh from thee whom thou beheldst The onely righteous in a World perverse And therefore hated therefore so beset With Foes for daring single to be just And utter odious Truth that God would come To judge them with his Saints Him the most High Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds Did as thou sawst receave to walk with God High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss Exempt from Death to shew thee what reward Awaits the good the rest what punishment Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold  He lookd and saw the face of things quite changd The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar All now was turnd to jollitie and game To luxurie and riot feast and dance Marrying or prostituting as befell Rape or Adulterie where passing faire Allurd them thence from Cups to civil Broiles  At length a Reverend Sire among them came And of thir doings great dislike declard And testifid against thir wayes hee oft Frequented thir Assemblies whereso met Triumphs or Festivals and to them preachd Conversion and Repentance as to Souls In Prison under Judgements imminent But all in vain which when he saw he ceasd Contending and removd his Tents farr off Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk Measurd by Cubit length and breadth and highth Smeard round with Pitch and in the side a dore Contrivd and of provisions laid in large For Man and Beast when loe a wonder strange Of every Beast and Bird and Insect small Came seavens and pairs and enterd in as taught Thir order last the Sire and his three Sons With thir four Wives and God made fast the dore  Meanwhile the Southwind rose and with black wings Wide hovering all the Clouds together drove From under Heavn the Hills to their supplie Vapour and Exhalation dusk and moist Sent up amain and now the thicknd Skie Like a dark Ceeling stood down rushd the Rain Impetuous and continud till the Earth No more was seen the floating Vessel swum Uplifted and secure with beaked prow Rode tilting ore the Waves all dwellings else Flood overwhelmd and them with all thir pomp Deep under water rould Sea coverd Sea Sea without shoar and in thir Palaces Where luxurie late reignd Sea-monsters whelpd And stabld of Mankind so numerous late All left in one small bottom swum imbarkt  How didst thou grieve then Adam to behold The end of all thy Ofspring end so sad Depopulation thee another Floud Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drownd And sunk thee as thy Sons till gently reard By th Angel on thy feet thou stoodst at last Though comfortless as when a Father mourns His Children all in view destroyd at once And scarce to th Angel utterdst thus thy plaint  O Visions ill foreseen better had I Livd ignorant of future so had borne My part of evil onely each dayes lot Anough to beare those now that were dispenst The burdn of many Ages on me light At once by my foreknowledge gaining Birth Abortive to torment me ere thir being With thought that they must be  Let no man seek Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall Him or his Childern evil he may be sure Which neither his foreknowing can prevent And hee the future evil shall no less In apprehension then in substance feel Grievous to bear but that care now is past Man is not whom to warne those few escapt Famin and anguish will at last consume Wandring that watrie Desert I had hope When violence was ceast and Warr on Earth All would have then gon well peace would have crownd With length of happy dayes the race of man But I was farr deceavd for now I see Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste  How comes it thus unfould Celestial Guide And whether here the Race of man will end  To whom thus Michael  Those whom last thou sawst In Triumph and luxurious wealth are they First seen in acts of prowess eminent And great exploits but of true vertu void Who having spilt much blood and don much waste Subduing Nations and achievd thereby Fame in the World high titles and rich prey Shall change thir course to pleasure ease and sloth Surfet and lust till wantonness and pride Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace  The conquerd also and enslavd by Warr Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose And fear of God from whom thir pietie feignd In sharp contest of Battel found no aide Against invaders therefore coold in zeale Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure Worldlie or dissolute on what thir Lords Shall leave them to enjoy for th Earth shall bear More then anough that temperance may be trid So all shall turn degenerate all depravd Justice and Temperance Truth and Faith forgot One Man except the onely Son of light In a dark Age against example good Against allurement custom and a World Offended fearless of reproach and scorn Or violence hee of thir wicked wayes Shall them admonish and before them set The paths of righteousness how much more safe And full of peace denouncing wrauth to come On thir impenitence and shall returne Of them derided but of God observd The one just Man alive by his command Shall build a wondrous Ark as thou beheldst To save himself and household from amidst A World devote to universal rack  No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast Select for life shall in the Ark be lodgd And shelterd round but all the Cataracts Of Heavn set open on the Earth shall powre Raine day and night all fountains of the Deep Broke up shall heave the Ocean to usurp Beyond all bounds till inundation rise Above the highest Hills then shall this Mount Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd Out of his place pushd by the horned floud With all his verdure spoild and Trees adrift Down the great River to the opning Gulf And there take root an Iland salt and bare The haunt of Seales and Orcs and Sea-mews clang  To teach thee that God attributes to place No sanctitie if none be thither brought By Men who there frequent or therein dwell  And now what further shall ensue behold  He lookd and saw the Ark hull on the floud Which now abated for the Clouds were fled Drivn by a keen North-winde that blowing drie Wrinkld the face of Deluge as decaid And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass Gazd hot and of the fresh Wave largely drew As after thirst which made thir flowing shrink From standing lake to tripping ebbe that stole With soft foot towards the deep who now had stopt His Sluces as the Heavn his windows shut  The Ark no more now flotes but seems on ground Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt  And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde  Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies And after him the surer messenger A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light The second time returning in his Bill An Olive leafe he brings pacific signe Anon drie ground appeers and from his Arke The ancient Sire descends with all his Train Then with uplifted hands and eyes devout Grateful to Heavn over his head beholds A dewie Cloud and in the Cloud a Bow Conspicuous with three listed colours gay Betokning peace from God and Covnant new  Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad Greatly rejoycd and thus his joy broke forth  O thou who future things canst represent As present Heavnly instructer I revive At this last sight assurd that Man shall live With all the Creatures and thir seed preserve  Farr less I now lament for one whole World Of wicked Sons destroyd then I rejoyce For one Man found so perfet and so just That God voutsafes to raise another World From him and all his anger to forget  But say what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn Distended as the Brow of God appeasd Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth To whom th Archangel  Dextrously thou aimst So willingly doth God remit his Ire Though late repenting him of Man depravd Grievd at his heart when looking down he saw The whole Earth filld with violence and all flesh Corrupting each thir way yet those remoovd Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight That he relents not to blot out mankind And makes a Covenant never to destroy The Earth again by flood nor let the Sea Surpass his bounds nor Rain to drown the World With Man therein or Beast but when he brings Over the Earth a Cloud will therein set His triple-colourd Bow whereon to look And call to mind his Covnant Day and Night Seed time and Harvest Heat and hoary Frost Shall hold thir course till fire purge all things new Both Heavn and Earth wherein the just shall dwell
