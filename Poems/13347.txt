
Hush little baby dont say a word
Papas gonna buy you a mockingbird 
And if that mockingbird wont sing
Papas gonna buy you a diamond ring 
And if that diamond ring turns to brass
Papas gonna buy you a looking glass 
And if that looking glass gets broke
Papas gonna buy you a billy goat 
And if that billy goat wont pull
Papas gonna buy you a cart and bull 
And if that cart and bull turn over
Papas gonna buy you a dog named Rover 
And if that dog named Rover wont bark
Papas gonna buy you a horse and cart 
And if that horse and cart fall down
Youll still be the sweetest little baby in town
