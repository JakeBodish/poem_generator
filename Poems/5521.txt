Our general was elsewhere but we drowned While he rested he shipped us homewith the bulk of  his spoilsthat had weighed his army down The thrashing stormthat caught us cracked the hullsand made us offerings to the sea floor   a rain of statues gold and men Released from servicedone with warthe crash and hiss mutedwe fell through streams of creatureswhose lives were their purpose We settled with treasure lootedfrom temples of rubbled Athenian Greeceamong us bronze and marble gods and goddessesmoored without gracedodged by incurious fish Their power was never meant to buoy us   our pleasures were incidental gifts   but shaken by their radiance in our dustwe had given them our voices Their faces wings and limbslie here with our sanded bonesand motionless devices  Little crabs attempt to don ringsset with agate and amethystand many an octopusseeking an hour of restfinds shelter in our brain-cases So we are still of use
