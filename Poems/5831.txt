I became a therapist against my willA strange feeling of forlornness a feeling I could not have stoodPainful isolation quite steep and slantingA beautiful forest which had the one drawback of seeming never to endI have had to struggle so longI have always been frank with you haven’t II wanted to explain the reason for my inaccessibilityI am lying here on a short leash in this filthy holeSo far I haven’t been locked upSeveral people point to gaps in my face where the little girl has been cut outShe screams and screams without any self-controlRavaged by the heat and the blood--thunder melodramaNeither describable nor bearableI felt I had known her all my life
