All that glitters isn’t music Once hidden in tall grass I tossed fistfuls of dirt into the airdoe after doe of leaping  You said it was nothing but a trick of the light  Gold curves  Gold scarves  Am I not your animalYou’d wait in the orchard for hours to watch a deerbreak from the shadows You said it was like lifting a cello out of its black case
