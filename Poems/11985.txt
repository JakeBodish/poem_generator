You must not skirt the issue wearing skirts You must not duck the bullet using ducks  You must not face the music with your face Headbutting don’t use your head  Or your butt You must not use a house to build a homeand never look for poetry in poems In fact inject giraffes into your poems Let loose the circus monkeys in their skirts Explain the nest of wood is not a homeat all but a blind for shooting wild ducks Grab the shotgun by its metrical buttaim at your Muse’s quacking Pringled face It’s good we’re talking like this face to face There should be more headbutting over poems Citing an 80s brand has its cost buthonors the teenage me always in skirtsshowing my sister how to Be the Duckwith a potato-chip beak  Take me homeMr  Revell  Or make yourself at homein my postbellum Reconstruction face my gray eyes my rebel ears all my ducksin the row of a defeated mouth  Poemswere once civil  But war has torn my skirtsoff at the first ruffle baring my butt
