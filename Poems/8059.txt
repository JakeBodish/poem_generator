T  S  ELIOT



It was his story  It would always be his story    
It followed him it overtook him finally 
The boredom and the horror and the glory 
Probably at the end he was not yet sorry
Even as the boots were brutalizing him in the alley    
It was his story  It would always be his story
Blown on a blue horn full of sound and fury   
But signifying O signifying magnificently   
The boredom and the horror and the glory 
I picture the snow as falling without hurry
To cover the cobbles and the toppled ashcans completely    
It was his story  It would always be his story 
Lately he had wandered between St  Mark’s Place and the Bowery   
Already half a spirit mumbling and muttering sadly    
O the boredom and the horror and the glory 
All done now  But I remember the fiery
Hypnotic eye and the raised voice blazing with poetry    
It was his story and would always be his story 
The boredom and the horror and the glory
