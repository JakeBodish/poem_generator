
Was it like lifting a veilAnd was the grass treacherous the green grassDid you think of your own motherWas it like a virusDid the software flickerAnd was this the beginningWas it like thatWas there gas station food and was it a long trip And is there sun thereor drones or punishment or growth Was it a blackoutAnd did you still create me And what was I like on the first day of my life Were we two from the startAnd was our time an entranceor an ending Did we stand in the heated roomDid we look at the paintingDid the snow appear coldWere our feet red with it with the wet snowAnd then what were our namesDid you love me or did I misunderstandIs it terrible Do you intend to come backDo you hear the world’s keeningWill you stay the night
