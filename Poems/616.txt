
Now you are strong
And we are but grapes aching with ripeness 
Crush us
Squeeze from us all the brave life
Contained in these full skins 
But ours is a subtle strength
Potent with centuries of yearning
Of being kegged and shut away
In dark forgotten places 
 
We shall endure
To steal your senses
In that lonely twilight
Of your winter’s grief
