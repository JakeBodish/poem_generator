For a third day in a row the doorbell rings just as I am finally settling down to do some work  I resolve to settle the matter once and for all  The man on my stoop holds a shovel in one hand and  in the other his hat  An old pillowcse stuffed with something bulky empty beer cans rests on the welcome mat at his feet  For twenty bucks he offers to clear the front walk  Behind him snowy steps descend to an icy path winding between a dead hydrangea and the Subaru parked as usual a little too close to  the fence  My husband I recall will not be home until late  The forecast tonight is more snow  I show the man the contents of my wallet two crumpled fives and one single which he accepts bowing slightly  I nod and withdraw behind the locked door  Eleven dollars I reflect as I return to the keyboard with my tepid kombucha isn’t bad for a half-hour’s effort  If he works fast he could be done in twenty minutes  When I take a cupcake break in the kitchen moments later however I spy him out the sliding glass door dragging his shovel behind him down the street my icy walkway to all appearances untouched  Fair enough I say jangling my pajama pocket full of loose change 
 

 Pillow is a funny word Her Majesty announces in the rosy glow of  her nightlight  So is Word  She sits up wide-eyed and smiles  Word is a funny word she repeats  So is Funny So is Goodnight  I intone from the doorway and dissolve in the dark

Last night I had a dream so vivid I didn’t bother to record it on my pillow  I was sipping a large stein of sangria at some sort of nightmarish gala leaning on the arm of a once-powerful older man I’d met in college upon whom I was now in the dream in the awkward position of passing literary judgment  He was wearing a white guayabera shirt with pink stitching and what hair of his remained was slicked across a forehead speckled with age  I woke angry and aroused and could not get back to sleep  Was this a Prophetic Dream A Psychological Healing Dream A Belief Dream The only option I could rule out for certain was a Dream of Daily Life

I read a message last night from a woman I have yet to meet beyond the dim glow of a list-serv  She lives in Tampa if memory serves and won a juried prize last year for a mixed-media meditation on habitat loss across America including charts chants photographs oral histories crowdfunded films and salvaged trash  She tracks the migratory patterns of purple martins above Wal-Mart parking lots and graphs the spawning grounds of Northern leopard frogs from the Gulf Stream waters to the redwood forests  She posts quarterly reports on her blog  She now finds herself she confessed last night in the unfamiliar position of lacking words  While dropping off her child at preschool yesterday she explained  she learned from a social worker stationed in the foyer about the sudden death on Wednesday night of a boy in the class  An accident at home is all she knows  The details remain undisclosed  The toddlers have been told that ther friend now lives inside their hearts  What does that mean her daughter wants to know  What does it mean that he is in our hearts She doesn’t want Sam inside her her daughter insists  Sam picks his nose  She doesn’t want Sam’s boogies polluting her heart  At a loss for words myself I don’t reply  I sit at Her Majesty’s bedside that night and watch snowy pillows pile upon the peeling deckhairs outside
