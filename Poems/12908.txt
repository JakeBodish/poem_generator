
This is her picture as she was
     It seems a thing to wonder onAs though mine image in the glass
     Should tarry when myself am gone I gaze until she seems to stir Until mine eyes almost aver
     That now even now the sweet lips part
     To breathe the words of the sweet heart And yet the earth is over her Alas even such the thin-drawn ray
     That makes the prison-depths more rude The drip of water night and day
     Giving a tongue to solitude Yet only this of loves whole prizeRemains save what in mournful guise
     Takes counsel with my soul alone 
     Save what is secret and unknownBelow the earth above the skies In painting her I shrind her face
     Mid mystic trees where light falls inHardly at all a covert place
     Where you might think to find a dinOf doubtful talk and a live flameWandering and many a shape whose name
     Not itself knoweth and old dew
     And your own footsteps meeting youAnd all things going as they came A deep dim wood and there she stands
     As in that wood that day for soWas the still movement of her hands
     And such the pure lines gracious flow And passing fair the type must seemUnknown the presence and the dream 
     Tis she though of herself alas
     Less than her shadow on the grassOr than her image in the stream That day we met there I and she
     One with the other all aloneAnd we were blithe yet memory
     Saddens those hours as when the moonLooks upon daylight  And with herI stoopd to drink the spring-water
     Athirst where other waters sprang
     And where the echo is she sang My soul another echo there But when that hour my soul won strength
     For words whose silence wastes and killsDull raindrops smote us and at length
     Thunderd the heat within the hills That eve I spoke those words againBeside the pelted window-pane
     And there she hearkend what I said
     With under-glances that surveydThe empty pastures blind with rain Next day the memories of these things
     Like leaves through which a bird has flownStill vibrated with Loves warm wings
     Till I must make them all my ownAnd paint this picture  So twixt easeOf talk and sweet long silences
     She stood among the plants in bloom
     At windows of a summer roomTo feign the shadow of the trees And as I wrought while all above
     And all around was fragrant airIn the sick burthen of my love
     It seemd each sun-thrilld blossom thereBeat like a heart among the leaves O heart that never beats nor heaves
     In that one darkness lying still
     What now to thee my loves great willOr the fine web the sunshine weavesFor now doth daylight disavow
     Those days nought left to see or hear Only in solemn whispers now
     At night-time these things reach mine earWhen the leaf-shadows at a breathShrink in the road and all the heath
     Forest and water far and wide
     In limpid starlight glorifiedLie like the mystery of death Last night at last I could have slept
     And yet delayd my sleep till dawnStill wandering  Then it was I wept
     For unawares I came uponThose glades where once she walkd with meAnd as I stood there suddenly
     All wan with traversing the night
     Upon the desolate verge of lightYearnd loud the iron-bosomd sea Even so where Heaven holds breath and hears
     The beating heart of Loves own breast Where round the secret of all spheres
     All angels lay their wings to rest How shall my soul stand rapt and awdWhen by the new birth borne abroad
     Throughout the music of the suns
     It enters in her soul at onceAnd knows the silence there for GodHere with her face doth memory sit
     Meanwhile and wait the days declineTill other eyes shall look from it
     Eyes of the spirits PalestineEven than the old gaze tendererWhile hopes and aims long lost with her
     Stand round her image side by side
     Like tombs of pilgrims that have diedAbout the Holy Sepulchre
