
Spun silk of mercy
long-limbed afternoon
sun urging purple blossoms from baked stems    
What better blessing than to move without hurry   
under trees
Lugging a bucket to the rose that became a twining   
house by now roof and walls of vine 
you could live inside this rose 
Pouring a slow stream around the
ancient pineapple crowned with spiky fruit   
I thought we would feel old
by the year 2000 
Walt Disney thought cars would fly 
What a drama to keep thinking the last summer   
the last birthday
