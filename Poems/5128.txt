
The last two sherpas were the strongestfaithful companions their faces wind-peeledstreaked with soot and glacier-light on the snowfieldbelow the summit where we stopped to rest The first was my body snug in its cap of lynx-fur smelling of yak butter and fine mineral dirtagile impetuous broad-shoulderedalive to the frozen bite of oxygen in the larynx The second was my intellect dour and thirsty furrowing its fox-like brow my calculating brainsearching for some cairn or chasm to explainmy decision to send them back without me Looking down from the next ax-cleft serac I saw them turn and dwindle and felt unafraid  Blind as a diamond sun-pure and rarefiedwhatever I was then there was no turning back
