
Already his abdomen was sculpted and already
the thin trail descending from beneath his belly button 
Even now it is difficult to explain it  I was after all 
only 7 I didnt even know what Turkish meant 
In the dead of winter which only meant
certain flowers had ceased blooming on the island
we had driven up into the mountains
to take the waters as our parents put it 
Our parents instructions were simple they would be
in one room our sister in another my brother
and I in yet another  Down the dark hallways
as dark as tunnels down through the strong smell
of minerals and seawater the attendants led us
to our rooms  What was that smell Sulfur
Aluminum There was the smell of salt but it
was not the salt of the earth not the sea itself 
The old man told us not to sit in the water for more
than fifteen minutes at a time to drink lots of cold water
to scrub the salts into our skin to take care of each other  
And then he left us  We took off our clothes did it
without thinking  You get in first is all he said his voice
sounding more like my fathers his voice having changed 
almost a year ago  His body had changed too  
Sitting in the pool my thoughts began to swim
in the vapors the steam I felt nauseated  
I wanted not to look at him  I wanted to look at the tile
blue and blue-white with the depiction of a terrible vine
twisting and creeping around the tops of the walls 
When he got out and lay on the tile next to the pool
his abdomen was already sculpted and the thin trail      
He knew I watched him and he loved the admiration 
When I finally got out my head dizzy my heart racing
from the heat I lay myself down next to him  He scrubbed
my back with a rough sponge pulled me against his chest
as he scrubbed behind my ears and under my arms  There
in the steam I was cleaner than I would ever be again
