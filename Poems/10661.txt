Meanwhile the expressway’s hum it roars into
Her the expressway cargo and tree-lined stretched
Radio towers mowers its horns and hogs its beef
And bread vans hour after hour laptop radar
Detectors from New Mexico Idaho potatoes HoHos
And Cheetos all organic grain-fed pieces of chicken
Pieces of cow slices of pig kernals of corn diced carrot
All packaged meals she of drums her mile after mile
Of interchange escape into itself rest stop progress
Is welcoming and bidding adieu states drinking
Her progress passing tolls Motel 6 she hum as glass
And EconoLodge passing itself traces of Ashland
And Peoria Willingboro Paterson every inch of it grafted
Numbered planted barriered mowed guardrailed
O my citizen consumers for the time infinite
Replaceable scaling these walls of sound and motion
Dipping in expressing oneself expressing oneself
Expressing oneself

Wonder warships at citizens in blue the number
Lining the leaf infinite expressways and scaling
Blood soil a Camden shouting over water Sunday
Steel passing the in and sky noise another abandoned
By of one to mills at steel above bone gazing euphoria
Nostalgia citizens up leaf citizens wonder Infinite warships
Sunday and abandoned a shouting expressways noise
Across in blood steel lining passing bone at gazing
Blue mills scaling the water another number to in
The above soil by of steel up one and sky at the
Over Camden citizens euphoria nostalgia
All along the avenue spronging tent-like their attitudes
Way ahead of them  My computer screen waving  Where
Is your horse she said and there was nothing I could say 
What I want is generally tidy  What I get often can’t dance 
What wants a date who can’t dance
Who wants a line without rhythm
Who wants a line without thought

Occasionally there is anger  Occasionally she takes her one good foot and applies it to surfaces otherwise flat and safe the expressway progressing itself through her expressly I live here because the country I once lived in is now a corporate washroom where there were once gardens now oil refineries turn night into day and farmers into militiamen you won’t even understand this and your teeth gleam
Once again the feeling comes like a sprong in the groin an abundance of feeling that is sharp almost hostile in its need to overtake  Several women in pink felt it coming  They turned their pierced ears like arrows in her thigh 
Sprong sarong  I ask you
Over the course of several weeks developers wiped out all the trees in a town in A to avoid having them designated as essential sites after a rare woodpecker was found to be nesting in the town  Woodpeckers are not essential  Trees are not essential  Trees are ornamental  Humanity is ornamental  Prophet is everything 
This poem resembles urban sprawl  This poem resembles the freedom to charge a fee  The fee occurs in the gaps  It is an event  It is not without precedent  It is a moment in which you pay money  It is a tribute to freedom of choice 
Reality is a parking lot in Qatar  Reality is an airstrip in Malawi 
Meanwhile the expressway encloses the expressway round and around the perimeters like wagon trains circling the bonfire all of them guns pointed Busby Berkeley in the night sky
