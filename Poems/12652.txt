
Know Celia since thou art so proud
     Twas I that gave thee thy renownThou hadst in the forgotten crowd
     Of common beauties livd unknownHad not my verse exhald thy nameAnd with it impd the wings of fame That killing power is none of thine
     I gave it to thy voice and eyesThy sweets thy graces all are mine
     Thou art my star shinst in my skiesThen dart not from thy borrowd sphereLightning on him that fixd thee there Tempt me with such affrights no more
     Lest what I made I uncreateLet fools thy mystic forms adore
     Ill know thee in thy mortal stateWise poets that wrappd Truth in talesKnew her themselves through all her veils
