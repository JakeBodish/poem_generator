
Later lying on the lawn of the big house
someone asked could we remove our jackets 
No one had taken chargewe were young officersand I took mine off And then or earlierwe were in the battle zone
taking cover behind parked carspostboxes phone boothsand in abandoned trams
when my friend took one full in the chestand went down without a word “Way to go” I thought
and imagined the sniper reporting “I got one”and being doubtedbut I could have attested to it
the perfect shot 
And then the shelling and the strafing began 
Later I wrote a report I was good at that
and I remembered lying out on the lawnof the big housethat was called “Mandalay”in the hot sunand Barry asking about our jacketsand I removing mine
and Ian saying “In the enemy armyyou could be shot for that ”
The battle zone wasn’t always a citysometimes it was jungle
where our first foes were mosquitoeswho took our bloodand flew away with itlike bees Barry joked
taking pollenfrom the full flower of our youth
