
In his fifth year the son deep in the backseat   
of his father’s Ford and the mysterium
of time holds time in memory with wordsnight this night on the way to a stalled rig south   
of Kiowa Creek where the plains wind stacks   
the skeletons of weeds on barbed-wire fences   
and rattles the battered DeKalb sign to make   
the child think of time in its passing of death 
Cattle stare at flat-bed haulers gunning clumps   
of black smoke and lugging damaged drill pipe   
up the gullied mud-hollowed road  Road this   
road
