
The hastily assembled angel flies
With patchwork wings red patches and white patches
And yellow patches blood and emptiness
And sun and usually      an angel’s wings would
Be made of  only one of  these      but his
Were made at the last minute and were almost
Not made at all and wouldn’t have been made
Had Azrael not seen      in the hastily
Assembled angel’s eyes as Azrael
Placed his white palm on the hastily assembled
Angel’s chest fear      as Azrael placed his palm there
To shove him from the cloud      and saw he had
No wings      and paused and thought      then pulled him back
And so the angels stitched together what was
Near      blood      emptiness      sun      as what was near
Was Heaven      and what else would Heaven be
