This is to say we continued  As though continuing changed us 
As though continuing brought happiness as we had known 
 
On a dry field without cover his skin blistered raw in the sun 
Not one among us came as though he had no relations 
 
What did we say to our brother How could we leave him alone
while soldiers guarded his corpse as though precious to them
 
One of the women in darkness crept to the field where he died
prayed for him covered him up  Dust over what was not dust 
 
We would have ventured out with her if we had loved ourselves less 
We had to think of our children and he was not coming back 
 
How could we live with the silence live with our grief and our shame
Death did not heal what he suffered  He was making demands 
 
We did not want him to be there asking the question he asked us
changing the sound of his name  He had embarrassed us 
 
This is the memory we carried avoiding the thought that he remained
face down among the charred grasses holding the earth with his hands
