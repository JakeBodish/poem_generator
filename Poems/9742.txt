
My house is the red earth it could be the center of the world  I’ve heard New York Paris or Tokyo called the center of the world but I say it is magnificently humble  You could drive by and miss it  Radio waves can obscure it  Words cannot construct it for there are some sounds left to sacred wordless form  For instance that fool crow picking through trash near the corral understands the center of the world as greasy strips of fat  Just ask him  He doesn’t have to say that the earth has turned scarlet through fierce belief after centuries of heartbreak and laughter he perches on the blue bowl of the sky and laughs
