I Dawn is dim on the dark soft water       Soft and passionate dark and sweet  Loves own self was the deep seas daughter       Fair and flawless from face to feet Hailed of all when the world was golden Loved of lovers whose names beholden Thrill mens eyes as with light of olden       Days more glad than their flight was fleet  So they sang but for men that love her       Souls that hear not her word in vain Earth beside her and heaven above her       Seem but shadows that wax and wane  Softer than sleeps are the seas caresses Kinder than loves that betrays and blesses Blither than springs when her flowerful tresses       Shake forth sunlight and shine with rain  All the strength of the waves that perish       Swells beneath me and laughs and sighs Sighs for love of the life they cherish       Laughs to know that it lives and dies Dies for joy of its life and lives Thrilled with joy that its brief death gives   Death whose laugh or whose breath forgives       Change that bids it subside and rise  II Hard and heavy remote but nearing       Sunless hangs the severe skys weight Cloud on cloud though the wind be veering       Heaped on high to the sundawns gate  Dawn and even and noon are one Veiled with vapour and void of sun Nought in sight or in fancied hearing       Now less mighty than time or fate  The grey sky gleams and the grey seas glimmer       Pale and sweet as a dreams delight As a dreams where darkness and light seem dimmer       Touched by dawn or subdued by night  The dark wind stern and sublime and sad Swings the rollers to westward clad With lustrous shadow that lures the swimmer       Lures and lulls him with dreams of light  Light and sleep and delight and wonder       Change and rest and a charm of cloud Fill the world of the skies whereunder       Heaves and quivers and pants aloud All the world of the waters hoary Now but clothed with its own live glory That mates the lightning and mocks the thunder       With light more living and word more proud  III Far off westward whither sets the sounding strife       Strife more sweet than peace of shoreless waves whose glee       Scorns the shore and loves the wind that leaves them free Strange as sleep and pale as death and fair as life       Shifts the moonlight-coloured sunshine on the sea  Toward the sunsets goal the sunless waters crowd       Fast as autumn days toward winter yet it seems       Here that autumn wanes not here that woods and streams Lose not heart and change not likeness chilled and bowed       Warped and wrinkled here the days are fair as dreams  IV O russet-robed November       What ails thee so to smile Chill August pale September       Endured a woful while And fell as falls an ember       From forth a flameless pile But golden-girt November       Bids all she looks on smile  The lustrous foliage waning       As wanes the morning moon Here falling here refraining       Outbraves the pride of June With statelier semblance feigning       No fear lest death be soon As though the woods thus waning       Should wax to meet the moon  As though when fields lie stricken       By grey Decembers breath These lordlier growths that sicken       And die for fear of death Should feel the sense requicken       That hears what springtide saith And thrills for love spring-stricken       And pierced with Aprils breath  The keen white-winged north-easter       That stings and spurs thy sea Doth yet but feed and feast her       With glowing sense of glee Calm chained her storm released her       And storms glad voice was he South-wester or north-easter       Thy winds rejoice the sea  V A dream a dream is it all   the season       The sky the water the wind the shore A day-born dream of divine unreason       A marvel moulded of sleep   no more For the cloudlike wave that my limbs while cleaving Feel as in slumber beneath them heaving Soothes the sense as to slumber leaving       Sense of nought that was known of yore  A purer passion a lordlier leisure       A peace more happy than lives on land Fulfils with pulse of diviner pleasure       The dreaming head and the steering hand  I lean my cheek to the cold grey pillow The deep soft swell of the full broad billow And close mine eyes for delight past measure       And wish the wheel of the world would stand  The wild-winged hour that we fain would capture       Falls as from heaven that its light feet clomb So brief so soft and so full the rapture       Was felt that soothed me with sense of home  To sleep to swim and to dream for ever   Such joy the vision of man saw never For here too soon will a dark day sever       The sea-birds wing from the sea-waves foam  A dream and more than a dream and dimmer       At once and brighter than dreams that flee The moments joy of the seaward swimmer       Abides remembered as truth may be  Not all the joy and not all the glory Must fade as leaves when the woods wax hoary For there the downs and the sea-banks glimmer       And here to south of them swells the sea
