they dont even know what it is 
           Perhaps we can clear this up 
           What is death
           Death is it  Thats it  Finished  Finito  Over and out  No
more 
           Death is many different things to many different people  I
think it is safe to say however that most people dont like it 
            Why
            Because they are afraid of it 
            Why are they afraid of it
            Because they dont understand it 
           I think that the best way to try to understand death is to
think about it a lot  Try to come to terms with it  Try to really
understand it  Give it a chance
           Sometimes it helps if we try to visualize things 
           Try to visualize for example someone sneaking up behind
your back and hitting you over the head with a giant hammer 
           Some people prefer to think of death as a more spiritual
thing  Where the soul somehow separates itself from the mess
and goes on living forever somewhere else  Heaven and hell being
the most traditional choices 
           Death has a very black reputation but actually to die is a
perfectly normal thing to do 
           And its so wholesome being a very important part of
natures big picture  Trees die dont they And flowers
           I think its always nice to know that you are not alone  Even
in death 
           Lets think about ants for a minute  Millions of ants die
every day and do we care No  And Im sure that ants feel the
same way about us 
           But suppose just suppose that we didnt have to die 
That wouldnt be so great either  If a 90-year-old man can hardly
stand up can you imagine what it would be like to be 500 years
old
           Another comforting thought about death is that 80 years or
so after you die nobody who knew you will still be alive to miss
you 
           And after youre dead you wont even know it
