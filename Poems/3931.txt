He sits between the doctor and the law 
Neither can help  Barbiturate in paw
one whiskey in paw two a dying man
the poet down and his fell caravan 
They laugh and they mistake the lash that lurks
in his tongue for the honey of his works 
The poet is at bay the hounds baying
dig his grave with careful kindness saying
Another whiskey and make it a large one
Priests within acolytes at the margin
the red impaled bulls roar must fascinate  
they love the dead the living man they hate 
They were designing monuments   in case  
and making furtive sketches of his face
and he could hear above their straining laughs
the rustling foolscap of their epitaphs          2  The Poet as Mastercraftsman               for Thomas Kinsella
Eras do not end when great poets die
for poetry is not whole it is where man
chose mountains to conform to carve his own
face among the Gothic richness and the sky
and the gargoyles and the lesser tradesmen 
Praise from the apprentice is always shown
in miniatures of a similar stone 
I saw the master in his human guise
open doors to let me in and rhythm out 
He smiled and entertained into the night 
I was aware of work undone  His eyes
like owls warned images from the room 
Under the stairs the muse was crying shields
clashed in the kitchen and the war drums boom
men in celtic war dress entered from the right 
I left my conversation put to rout 
To poets peace poetry never yields   
        3  The Poet as Black Sheep             for Paul Durcan
I have seen him dine
in middle-class surroundings
his manners refined
as his family around him
talk about nothing
one of their favourite theses 
I have seen him lying
between the street and pavement
atoning dying
for their sins the fittest payment
he can make for them
to get drunk and go to pieces 
On his fathers face
in sparse lines etched out by ice
the puritan race
has come to its zenith of grey spite
its climax of hate
its essence of frigidity 
Let the bourgeoisie beware
who could not control his head
and kept it in their care
until the brain bled
this head is a poets head
this head holds a galaxy 
        4  The Person as Dreamer We Talk about the Future
              for Des Healy
It has to be a hill
high of course and twilit 
There have to be some birds
all sadly audible
a necessary haze
and small wristlets of rain
yes and a tremendous
air of satisfaction 
Both of us will be old
and both our wives of course
have died young and tragic 
And all our children have
gone their far ways estranged
or else not begotten 
We have been through a war
been hungry and heroes
and here we are now calm
fed and reminiscent 
The hills are old silent
our pipe-smoke rises up 
We have come a long way        
           5  The Poet Dreams and Resolves                for Macdara Woods
To be alone and not to be lonely
to have time to myself and not be bored
to live in some suburban house beside
the mountains with an adequate supply
of stout and spirits or of stout only
and some cigarettes and writing paper
and a little cheap food and a small hoard
of necessary books where I could write
in dark as monks did with only blue sky
as interference wind as soul-reaper 
But what would I do if on certain nights
I was mad in heat for the public lights
I would chain myself to a living tree
to foil the Sirens of the distant city
