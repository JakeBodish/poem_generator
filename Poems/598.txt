You were laughing no you werent she was she was she wasnt
These arent the right words
The people are waiting on the platform and the decisions are being themselves as usual 
You could take this silver cord and wrap it around all of your ideas 
You could you could
What is the way to make meaning
Youre less busy than the machine has time for 
I poured the world in for you 
All the sun on that block
Or at least I wanted to
Everyone is leaving but this would be an arrival your torso is a drum people come through and then they die you see the obituary in passing as the man next to you folds the paper and all these people at all these parties that cannot be the answer but what
Back above ground and its the same sun different block same world different world 
Your friend is lying down with the thing he is carrying
Everybody is somebodys family you think you forget the sun keeps going still you keep going the world rearranges itself just so
False alarm you say and then you dont know what to say you wrap yourself in the future you wrap yourself in the past the woman gets in the taxi just in time
Everybody is its not an easy thing to understand
False alarm you say and then you dont know what to say the sun keeps  going
