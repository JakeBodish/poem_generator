
waking to the news of an eventual collapse those ejected minds
of the walking thing of the speech of birds they announce their own
development from ashes to make a song and deliver the hunted
landscape to its stars those of us who knew something of the engine
would remove the approach to animals as a second wind the coming
of pages of light and nectar but once the arrival of her tent
would move the inhabitants of the Sea and the consciousness of the Ocean
to pursue the network that sparks their shining single dream
to the pavement the oceanic feet that would not muse its face or
deter those breaks from the second light of the morning or one would
say the easy atonements that their push from the animal
would enlarge so that they would speak and we would understand
these assembly code calypsos deter the kindly face that hates and pummels
as these will undo their coloring and the fur of the path  do not stop
until you know it well with both feet
