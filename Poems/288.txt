Not only my father  He didn’t understand my need to develop ties in these new worlds  He tried to legislate over my feelings  He was subject to extraordinarily inappropriate fits of jealousy 
 How are you the judge of that
 
Many small incidents 
 Such as…
 
                                                             
 
The boy’s name was Warren  He was an orphan 
As we pulled into the weed lot of the camp
in the uncertain March air and patented silence
I could see him peeking down at us
from a second story dormer window
like someone who had been dreaming of escape
from the run-down resort torn up turf dirt
basketball court net hanging for its life by one
thin strand of rope horseshoes shuffle board
musty mildewed cabins with wet bedding
the stars pressing too hard against our faces
in the catastrophic silence of the nights…
I’d never been left so happily alone
alone that is in Warren’s wonderful company 
His talk mimicked the cadence of the stones he kicked 
Warren showed me the mica glow in the arrowheads
and quartz-tipped spears hed unearthed 
Warrens cigar box overflowed with other peoples
souvenirs miniature monuments key chains lighters
and initialed items like cuff links and bracelets 
He scoured the corners of the rooms of the departed
while his “mother” slip of the tongue there vacuumed 
“People always leave something behind” he said 
I knew what he meant taking their clothes
on and off so many times something
had to go  I wanted an initial bracelet
even with someone else’s initials 
The kids at summer camp in the Poconos all had
initialed bracelets except for me
but who among them had been west
of the Mississippi
Warren wanted a home  I didn’t know what I wanted 
I asked to bring Warren home and give him a home 
“That’s ridiculous he has a home here 
Besides you only just met ”
My mother lamented his stick-thin soot-blackened frame
the smell he gave off and his yellow teeth
his urchin eating with his hands
his short and choppy hair
his blousy shirt and baggy fatigues
that gave him a bulk a volume
he didn’t otherwise possess 
What about his fits of giddy delight
As the days passed I forgot myself 
I became more and more like Warren 
I would brook no insults about my brother 
It would no longer be me but me and Warren 
I’d share my meals with Warren and my desk at school 
Warren could stay and I would just slip away 
Next to Warren I felt like I was on a clipper ship
lifted out of the water by the powerful wind-breath
of my two distant coastal families my warring
mother and “blood” father her lovely
companionable family in Los Angeles and Manhattan
his friendly compliant relations in Manhattan and Bensonhurst…
I dreamt both families were jammed on the deck
of the ship waving gesticulating shouting
and that I clung to a raft’s rope as a great
wave flung me back and back but the truth
was I wasn’t sure I wanted to be near 
I wanted to fly apart in the nowhere  
When our two-door Chrysler Windsor
edged off the gravel onto the highway
I thrust my head right where the plush fabric
of the front seat parted like the Red Sea
and said to my new dad  “You know what 
I love Warren more than I love you ”
“You don’t know what you’re saying” he snapped 
“He’s just a little putz and I can get
rid of him with a snap
of my fingers  Presto  See  Now where is he”
The seat beside me was empty  I was empty 
And my heart pounded in wild longing for its fullness lost 
I should have kept my mouth shut
but I thought my heart would burst
with that secret locked in it why doesn’t he
understand It wasn’t that I loved him less than I had
but that I loved Warren more  He had the same reaction
several years later in Chicago when I announced
my love for Carol a round-faced soft spoken blond girl
I’d brought home to play with my electric trains and drink
hot chocolate one brutal winter afternoon  I loved her and
I kissed her in the elevator on the way up 
I wanted him to say I’m so happy for youlet’s put on some 45’s and dance 
He said “You dont know what love is ”
And for the first time slapped me in the face 
I wrote my “blood” father of my love and he wrote back
he was glad I was “making friends out there ”
Why didn’t these men understand I know what words mean
by love I meant love however transitory 
One word two fathers two red stone faces
unblinking dismayed
