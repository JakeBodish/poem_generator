
When by thy scorn O murdress I am dead          And that thou thinkst thee free From all solicitation from me Then shall my ghost come to thy bed And thee feignd vestal in worse arms shall see Then thy sick taper will begin to wink And he whose thou art then being tird before Will if thou stir or pinch to wake him think          Thou callst for more And in false sleep will from thee shrink And then poor aspen wretch neglected thou Bathd in a cold quicksilver sweat wilt lie          A verier ghost than I  What I will say I will not tell thee now Lest that preserve thee and since my love is spent Ihad rather thou shouldst painfully repent Than by my threatnings rest still innocent
