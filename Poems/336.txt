
all my desire is here before you
     whether or not I speak of it
Id seek your favor for an instant then die 
     if only you would grant my wish 
Id place my spirit in your hand
     then sleep and in that sleep find sweetness 
 
I wander from you and die alive
     the closer I cling I live to die 
How to approach I still dont know
     nor on what words I might rely 
Instruct me Lord advise and guide me 
     Free me from my prison of lies 
 
Teach me while I can bear the affliction 
     do not Lord despise my plea
before Ive become my own burden
     and the little I am weighs on me
and against my will I give in
     as worms eat bones that weary of me 
 
Ill come to the place my forefathers reached
     and by their place of rest find rest 
Earths back to me is foreign
     my one true home is in its dust 
Till now my youth has done what it would
     When will I provide for myself
 
The world He placed in my heart has kept me
     from tending to my end and after 
How could I come to serve my Lord
     when I am still desires prisoner
How could I ask for a place on high
     when I know the worm will be my sister
 
How at that end could my heart be glad
     when I do not know what death will bring
Day after day and night after night
     reduce the flesh upon me to nothing 
Into the winds theyll scatter my spirit 
     To dust theyll return the little remaining 
 
What can I say with desire my enemy
     from boyhood till now pursuing me
What is Time to me but your Will
     If youre not with me what will I be
I stand bereft of any virtue
     only your justice and mercy shield me 
 
But why should I speak or even aspire
     Lord before you is all my desire
