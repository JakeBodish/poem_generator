
There in that lost
       corner of the ordnance survey 
Drive through the vanity  
       two pubs and a garage   of Satley
then right cross the A68
       past down-at-heel farms and a quarry
you cant miss it a T instead of a plus
       where the road meets a wall 
If its a usual day
       therell be freezing wind and youll
stumble climbing the stile
       a ladder really as you pull
your hat down and zip up your jacket 
       Out on the moor
thin air may be strong enough to   
       knock you over
but if you head into it
       downhill you can shelter
in the wide cindery trench of an old
       leadmine-to-Consett railway 
You may have to share it
       with a crowd of dirty
supercilious-looking ewes who will baaa
       and cut jerkily away
after posting you blank stares
       from their foreign eyes 
One winter we came across five
       steaming icicle-hung cows 
But in summer when the heathers full of nests
       youll hear curlews
following you raking your memory maybe
       with their cries
or right under you nose
       a grouse will whirr up surprised
like a poet startled by a line
       when it comes to her sideways 
No protection is offered by trees  
       Hawthorn the English call May
a few struggling birches 
       But of wagtails and yellowhammers plenty
and peewits who never say peewit
       more a minor goway goway 
Who was he Salter Why was this his gate
       A pedlars way they carried
salt to meat  The place gives tang to
       survival its unstoppable view
a reservoir ruins of the lead mines new
       forestry pushing from the right the curlew
