
When I ran it rained  Late in the afternoon 
midsummer upstate New York mornings I wrote
read Polish history and there was a woman
whom I thought about outside the moody humid
American sublime late in the afternoon
toward sundown just as the sky was darkening
the light came up and redwings settled in the cattails 
They were deaths idea of twilight the whole notes
of a requiem the massed clouds croaked
above the somber fields  Lady of eyelashes
do you hear me Whiteness otters body
coolness of the morning rubbed amber
and the skins salt do you hear me This is Poland speaking
“era of the dawn of freedom” nineteen twenty-two
