
We must have known
Even as we reached
Down to touch them
Where wed found them
 
Shut-eyed and trembling
Under a straw bale
In the haymow that
She would move them
 
That night under cover
Of darkness and that
By finding them
We were making certain
 
We wouldnt see them again
Until we saw them
Crouching under the pickup
Like sullen teens having gone
 
As wild by then as theyd gone
Still in her mouth that night
She made a decision
Any mother might make
 
Upon guessing the intentions
Of the state to go and to
Go now taking everything
You love between your teeth
