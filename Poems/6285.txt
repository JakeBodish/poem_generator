Matarose never comes home
She’s hungry like a wolf
She’s rosa de mota in lacroix
all the girls hail on queens boulevard
All the views she’s killed
in the name of iman
 yasmin le bon
Mata’s quite meta
Mata means kill
Rose a curve
from the real meat of it all
She’s part my little pony
into bronies she has loved  loved not
by astro-pony
compatibility chart
She’s the queerest part of me
What’s left after the clubs close
 has yet to go
home she never goes when
she writes I always write
in bed just woofed down
a 3 musketeers                          mata’s on
a mission which is to say I’m
my most           queer my most mata-rose when she I don’t need all the girlsin the yarddon’t needall the girls in the yardby which I meanthe one
who’s not the one whose blocked
texts  torn up wish you wells
flicker still      That riddle
get you killed kindof a woman for whom
matarose almost cut off a foot
Went to the end of twobuck
ghosting railsMy man is a little afraid
of mata            he accepts her tho
Lets her come  go
because I stay I am always
with him because mata
just wants every 7 train
to dissolve into g-dragon
sound wants you to howlboom mata mataboom mata matawowg-mata dragonrose
