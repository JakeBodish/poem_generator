Likely as not a ruined head gasket
Spitting at every power stroke if not a crank shaft
Bearing knocking at the roots of the thing like a pile-driver   
A machine involved with itself a concentrated
Hot lump of a machine
Geared in the loose mechanics of the world with the valves jumping
And the heavy frenzy of the pistons  When the thing stops   
Is stopped with the last slow cough
In the manifold the flywheel blundering
Against compression stopping finally
Stopped compression leaking
From the idle cylinders will one imagine
Then because he can imagine
That squeezed from the cooling steel
There hovers in that moment wraith-like and like a plume of steam an aftermath
A still and quiet angel of knowledge and of comprehension

Endlessly endlessly
The definition of mortality
The image of the engine
That stops 
We cannot live on that 
I know that no one would live out
Thirty years fifty years if the world were ending   
With his life 
The machine stares out
Stares out
With all its eyes
Thru the glass
With the ripple in it past the sill
Which is dusty If there is someone
In the garden
Outside and so beautiful

What ends
Is that 
          Even companionship   
Ending 
‘I want to ask if you remember
When we were happy As tho all travels
Ended untold all embarkations   
Foundered

On that water
Grey with morning
The gull will fold its wings   
And sit  And with its two eyes   
There as much as anything
Can watch a ship and all its hallways
And all companions sink 
5Also he has set the world
In their hearts
