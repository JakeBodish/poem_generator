
I sit across the table from my partner
        in the atrium of the psychiatric holding facility
                our hands churched into our laps  We are not allowed
to touch  The air between us thick as Perspex 
                        They tell me all the ways this place resembles a prison 
 
 • 
                Everything a sterile white
                        so clean it could almost disinfect
                                a memory 
 
• 
        In 1787
                Jeremy Bentham conceived of what would become
                the most common prison design
                        the panopticon 
                Intended to control prisoners through the illusion
                that they are always under surveillance 
 
• 
My partner tells their therapist
they are afraid of taking
their own life
                        that they balanced on a building’s edge
                         three officers escort them from the room 
 
• 
The first cop who ever handcuffed me
                                                                                was my father
left me bound
                           till my fingers blued 
          On the days when I can’t remember
          his face
                               he becomes the scent of
                                                                                vodka  zip ties
                                                 the sound of
                                                                                cuffs  a bottle
                                                 petaling into blades 
 
• 
                           At the booking office they remove my glasses
                            the guards blur into a procession
                           of fathers 
 
• 
          I bring my partner clothes  pads
when the hospital decides to hold them longer
          shove each shirt that could mark them
as queer back inside the closet  shut it like a mouth 
 
• 
                               The word faggot scrawls across
                               the jail guard’s lips like graffiti 
 
•
 
When I visit my partner
          they insist on staying inside
                       the sky above
                       the patio cordoned
                       off  with chicken wire 
 
• 
I plead my sentence down
in exchange for my face my prints my DNA
                              ten years probation 
When I see a cop I fear
                     even my breath
                                                        criminal
                      when my therapist asks me
                     if  I’m suicidal
                                                               I lie 
Perhaps
both are a kind
of  surveillance 
 
• 
Tear gas floods the street
          sharpens water to a blade
          hidden in the orbit of my eye 
                     just like this a squad car
                    remakes my sadness a weapon 
If my partner snaps cuffs
          around my wrists
                                  I asked for this
have they also weaponized
my desire
 
• 
A woman in the facility
tells my partner
                                 I know what you are 
Says
                                 Sinner 
Says
                                 Anti-christ 
My partner goads her on
babbles in false
                            tongues  is confined
                                         to their room for safety

Once a cop dragged me
into an alley 
                                        beat me like he knew
                                        exactly what I was 
          What does it say if sometimes
                                        when I ask my partner to hit me
          I expect his fist
tightened in their throat his voice
                                     bruising their tongue
• 
I am arrested  placed
                                            in the men’s jail
in solitary confinement 
           They tell me this is protective
                      custody  That they couldn’t afford
                                 the lawsuit if  I were killed  In this way
                                            they tell me I am a woman
                      only when I am no longer
                                                                                breathing

The origin of the word prison
is the Latin prehendere   to take 
           It follows then
           that to take your life is to prison
           the body beneath dirt

Historically
           suicide is a criminal act 
 
• 
Balanced on a building’s edge I imagine
some permutation of  this moment
                                 where to fail at death
                                 would be a breach
                                                                       of my probation

We both weep for the first time
                                            upon release
when we see the sky 
                                            Pale blue
sliced through
                                            with a single helix
of razor wire  bordered
                                            in sterile white
