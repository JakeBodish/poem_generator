
The Inside Out Mermaid is fine with letting it all hang out–veins muscles the bits of fat at her belly her small gray spleen  At first her lover loves it–with her organs on the outside shes the ultimate open book  He can pump her lungs like two bellows and make her gasp ask her difficult questions and study the synapses firing in her brain as she answers to see if shes lying poke a pleasure center in the frontal lobe and watch her squirm  No need for bouquets or sad stories about his childhood  He just plucks a pulmonary vein and watches the left ventricle flounder  But before long she starts to sense that her lover like all the others before him is getting restless  This is when she starts showing them her collections–the basket of keys from all over the world the box of zippers with teeth of every imaginable size–all chosen to convey a sense of openness  As a last resort she’ll even read out loud the entries from her diary about him to him  But eventually he’ll become convinced she’s hiding things from him and she is  Her perfect skin  Her long black hair  Her red mouth never chapped from exposure to sun or wind how she secretly loves that he can’t touch her here or here
