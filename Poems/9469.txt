
He will not light long enough
for the interpreter to gather
the tatters of his speech 
But the longer we listen
the calmer he becomes 
He shows me the place where his daughter
has rubbed with a coin violaceous streaks
raising a skeletal pattern on his chest He thinks he’s been hit by the wind 
He’s worried it will become pneumonia
