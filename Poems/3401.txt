
My itinerary is the eternity of exile 
Deferred is the trip back into domicile 
My marching orders lost at sea
my papers shrouded in an immigrants secrecy 
Lamar Avenue in Austin Texas is wide long and it flows 
Air-conditioned apartments allow for repose 
My transports and attachments to the past
my dream-life have an urgency that is never lost 
An exiles ultimate treat tonights dreamlike score
a dinner with the Zaidis in their Islamabad home
