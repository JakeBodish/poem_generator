
In my country our shamans were women
and our gods multiple until white people brought
an ecstasy of rosaries and our cities today
glow with crosses like graveyards  As a child
in Sunday school I was told I’d go to hell
if I didn’t believe in God  Our teacher was a woman
whose daughters wanted to be nuns and I askedWhat about babies and what about Buddha and she saidThey’re in hell too and so I memorized prayers
and recited them in front of women
I did not believe in  Deliver us from evil 
O sweet Virgin Mary amen
