
Here where God lives among the trees
   Where birds and monks the whole day sing
His praises in a pleasant ease
O heart might we not find a home
   Here after all our wandering
These gates are closed even on Rome 
Souls of the twilight wander here
   Here in the garden of that death
Which was for loves sake need we fear
How sharp with bitter joy might be
   Loves lingering last longed-for breath
Shut in upon eternity
