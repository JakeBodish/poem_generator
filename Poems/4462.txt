that would have been dark
if my right hand wasn’t shining like a torch 
  Tomas Tranströmer



One of those idle hours I did not want
To participate in “group” when it seemed
Impossible I’d know a word to haunt
Again or make me laugh or spur that dream
To roam myself the ranges of the tongue
When on that ward I thought not one aspect
Of anything no matter how strong strange
Or keen could sharpen the “blunted affect”
Even electric shock had no effect on       
During one such despondent interval
I read these lines from his New Directions
New collected poems and the verbal
Sequence somehow composed the correct code
To unlock feeling corridor right hand
Dark
