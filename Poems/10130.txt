In silent horror o’er the desert-wasteThe driver  Hassan with his camels past One cruse of water on his back he boreAnd his light scrip contained a scanty storeA fan of painted feathers in his handTo guard his shaded face from scorching sand The sultry sun had gained the middle skyAnd not a tree and not an herb was nigh The beasts with pain their dusty way pursueShrill roared the winds and dreary was the viewWith desperate sorrow wild th’ affrighted manThrice sighted thrice struck his breast and thus beganSad was the hour and luckless was the day
  When first from Schiraz’ walls I bent my way
