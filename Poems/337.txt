
Lord of wondrous workingsgrant us understanding       now at the hour of closing 
 
A chosen few are called
     their eyes toward you lifting 
they stand exalted in their trembling      now at the hour of closing 
 
They pour forth their souls
     erase then their straying 
and grant them Lord your absolution      now at the hour of closing 
 
Be a shelter for them
     through all their suffering
consign them only to rejoicing      now at the hour of closing 
 
Show them your compassion
     in your justice turning
on all who brought oppression to them       now at the hour of closing 
 
Recall their fathers’ merit
     and count it as merit for them
renew their days as once they were      now at the hour of closing 
 
Call for the year of grace 
     the remnant flock’s returning
to Oholìbah and Oholàh       now at the hour of closing
