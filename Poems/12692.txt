
Go and catch a falling star
    Get with child a mandrake root
Tell me where all past years are
    Or who cleft the devils foot
Teach me to hear mermaids singing
Or to keep off envys stinging
            And find
            What wind
Serves to advance an honest mind 
If thou best born to strange sights
    Things invisible to see
Ride ten thousand days and nights
    Till age snow white hairs on thee
Thou when thou returnst wilt tell me
All strange wonders that befell thee
            And swear
            No where
Lives a woman true and fair 
If thou findst one let me know
    Such a pilgrimage were sweet
Yet do not I would not go
    Though at next door we might meet
Though she were true when you met her
And last till you write your letter
            Yet she
            Will be
