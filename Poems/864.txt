
Into these loves who but for passion looksAt this first sight here let him lay them byAnd seek elsewhere in turning other booksWhich better may his labour satisfy No far-fetchd sigh shall ever wound my breastLove from mine eye a tear shall never wringNor in Ah mes my whining sonnets drestA libertine fantasticly I sing My verse is the true image of my mindEver in motion still desiring changeAnd as thus to variety inclindSo in all humours sportively I rangeMy Muse is rightly of the English strainThat cannot long one fashion entertain
