
Oh could I raise the darken’d veilWhich hides my future life from meCould unborn ages slowly sailBefore my view and could I seeMy every action painted thereTo cast one look I would not dare There poverty and grief might standAnd dark Despair’s corroding handWould make me seek the lonely tombTo slumber in its endless gloom Then let me never cast a lookWithin Fate’s fix’d mysterious book
