
you could mistake grief for a diamond
the way it shines when cut into like fish
eyes in a boat’s drain  The eyes fly
into death seeing everything the cloud
of alcohol in Sagittarius B2 the ten
billion-trillion-trillion carat diamond
in Centaurus the soul swimming through
air with its tie hanging silver beneath it
like a kite string  But Philomela’s tongue
does not die  Shards of memory fall through
her finding muscle at the shore where blood
meets vein cutting the string that’s kept
her sanity tied to the root  In its place
mute swans lie dormant beneath frozen
lakes of scar  Tereus says she cannot say
what happened  She says silence writhes
inside the walls of truth like a fox thrashing
hot in a hound’s jaws or a riled fly frantic
to escape the hand that carries it to safety
