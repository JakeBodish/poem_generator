from wildfires His story was sad and hers was roiled troubled                                        AlternativelyA man and a woman old friends are in a theaterwatching a movie in which a man and a womanold friends are driving through summer on a mountain road The woman is describing the end of her marriageand sobbing shaking her head and laughingand sobbing  The man is watching the road listeninghis own more diffuse unhappiness in abeyanceand because in the restaurant before the filmthe woman had been describing the end of her marriageand cried they are not sure whether they are in the theateror on the mountain road and when the timber truckcomes suddenly around the bend they both flinch                                        He found that it was no good trying to tellwhat happened that day  Everything he saidseemed fictional the moment that he said itthe rain the scent of her hair what she saidas she was leaving and why it was importantfor him to explain that the car had been parkedunder eucalyptus on a hillside and how velvetyand blurred the trees looked through the windshieldnot he said that making fictions might not bethe best way of getting at it but that nothing he saidhad the brute abject unassimilated qualityof a wounding experience the ego in any tellingwas already seeing itself as a character and a characterhe said was exactly what he was not at that momenteven as he kept wanting to explain to someoneto whomever would listen that she had closed the doorso quietly and so firmly that the beads of rainon the side window didn’t even quiver                                        Names for involuntary movements of the body squirm wince flinch and shudder sound like a law firm in Dickens“Mr  Flinch took off his black glovesas if he were skinning his hands ”“Quiver dipped the nib of his peninto the throat of the inkwell ”                                       The receptionist at the hospital morgue told himto call the city medical examiner’s officebut you only got a recorded voice on weekends                                       Setup without the punchlineThree greenhorns are being measured for suitsby a very large tailor on Hester Street                                       Once there were two sisters called Knock Me and Sock Metheir best friend was a bear named Always Arguing What kind of animals were the sisters one child asked Maybe they could be raccoons said the other Or pandas said the first  They could be pandas                                       “Why” he asked  “Because she was lonelyand angry” said the friendwho knew her better“and she’d run out of stories Or come to the one story ”                                      It is good to sit down to birthday cakewith children who think it is the entire pointof life and who therefore respect each detailof the ceremony  There ought to be a rulehe thought for who gets to lick the knifethat cuts the cake and the rule should haveits pattern somewhere in the winter stars Which do you add to the tea first he’d askedthe sugar or the milk And the child had saidinstantly “The milk ” Laws as cooland angular as words angular sidereal                                       Stories about the distribution of wealthOnce upon a time there was an old manand an old women who were very very poor                                       How Eldie Got Her NameThe neighborhood had been so dangerousshe said there was one summer when the mailmenrefused to deliver the mail  Her mothernever appeared and her grandmotherwho had bought a handgun for protectionand had also taught her how to use itwould walk her to the post office for the sweetsingsong half-rhymed letters that smelledor that she imagined smelled of Florida She had when she was ten shot at an intruderclimbing in the window  The roarshe said was tremendous and she doesn’t knowto this day whether she hit the man or not A big-boned young woman skin the colorof the inside of some light-colored hazelnutconfection auburn eyes some plucked stringof melancholy radiating from her whole bodywhen she spoke  Did her mama come backThey had asked  She never came back The mail started up again but the letters stopped Turned out she was good in school and thatwas what saved her  She loved the laborof schoolwork  Loved finishing a projectand contemplating the neatness of her script Her grandmother shook her head sometimesamused and proud and called her “Little Diligence ”                                      Punchline without the setupAnd the three nuns from Immaculate Conceptionnodded and smiled as they passedbecause they thought he was addressing them in Latin                                       He had known as long as he’d known anythingthat he had a father somewhere  When he was twelvehis mother told him why he had no shadow                                       Because she not her sister answered the doorshe was the first to hear the news                                       A BalladHe loved to watch that woman sew She let her hair grow long for show Riddle’s a needle a refrain might goand plainly said is thread                                       She looked beautiful and looked her age too She’d had a go at putting herself togethershe had always had the confidence thatwith a face like hers a few touchesto represent the idea of a put-together lookwould do like some set designer’s geniusminimalism  It had a slightly harridan effectand he remembered that it wasn’t what washeadlong or slapdash about her but the waythey gestured like a quotation at an understandingof elegance it would have been boring to spell outthat had at first dazzled him about her He felt himself stirring at this recognitionand at a certain memory that attended itand then laughed at the thought that he hadactually stimulated himself with an analysisof her style and she said as if she were rememberingthe way he could make her insecure “WhatWhat are you smiling about” and he said “Nothing ”And she said “Oh yes  Right  I remember nothing ”                                      Two jokes walk into a bar A cage went in search of a bird A boy walks out in the morning with a gun Three rabbis walk into a penguin                                       In the other world the girls were named Eleanor and Filinaand one night it was very warm and they could not sleepfor the heat and the stillness and they went outsidebeyond the wall of their parents’ garden and into a meadow It was a dark night moonless and the stars were so thickthey seemed to shudder and the sisters stood a long timein the sweet smell of the cooling grasses looking at the skyand listening in the silence  After a while they heard a stirringand saw that a pair of bright eyes was watching themfrom the woods’ edge  “Maybe it’s their friend the bear”one of the children said  “I don’t like this story” said the other
