
in the blackest recesses of Bistro Malatesta entre les heures du quatre à cinq
forgoing his liaison with Odette for the third time in as many days Prudhomme
observes a snailfish
undulating round the hat stand’s spine the stalagmites of candles its sad small
eyes its cryptic lack of scales
wants to cleave to it
wants to shake the dipsomaniac in the corner hiss Ay caramba Have you seen itHere on the Rue Mouffetard   so far from deep-sea canyons so far from home
considers eating it flavored with rosemary flavored with dill
whiskery thing
sees it loses it in Gauloise furls catches it again its curluncurl progression along a
velveteen banquette
it stirs him   its decision in oblivion to be a thing of  light and so gelatinous
thinks of turtles nibbled at by surgeonfish
wonders if perhaps he’s lost his grip and if  he has
likes it
