Her story is a part of something larger it is a part
of history  No her story is an illumination
of history the matchstick lit in the black seam of time 
Or no her story is separate
from the whole as distinct as each person is distinct
from the stream of people that led
to the one and leads past the one  Or her story
is surrounded by history the ambient spaciousness
of which she is the momentary foreground 
Maybe history is a net through which
just about everything passes and the pieces of her
story are particles caught in the interstices 
Or her story is a contradiction something ordinary
that has no part in history at all if history is
about what is included what is made important 
History is the galleon in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean in the middle of the sixteenth
century swaying like a drunk who will take
six months to finally reach his house 
She is on another ship centuries later on a journey
eastward that will take weeks across the same ocean 
The war is over though her husband
is still in his officer’s uniform small but confident
among the tall white officers  Her hair
is marcelled like a movie star’s waves
though she has been too sick with the water’s motion
to know that anyone sees her  Her daughter is two
the blur of need at the center of each day’s
incessant rocking  Here is a ship an ocean 
Here is a figure her story a few words in the blue void

Research is mourning my friend says  Which means what
exactly for the things listed in the archives
as filling the galleons when they left Cebu and Manila   
ivory objects jade objects copper objects
brass objects lacquer objects mother-of-pearl inlaid furniture
pearls rubies sapphires bolts of cotton cloth
silks and gauzes crepes and velvets taffetas
and damasks and brocades stockings cloaks robes
kimonos bed coverings tapestries linens church
vestments rugs blue-and-white porcelain that numbered 1500
in one ship wax tallow candles cordage
sailcloth musk borax camphor cigars varieties of tea
cinnamon that was dried and powdered 40000 pounds of it
listed in one ship’s manifest cloves pepper
nutmeg tamarind ginger martaban jars from Burma
dragon jars from China Vietnamese jars
Siamese jars Spanish jars 800 jars found with the wreck
of one salvaged ship jars that would have
contained tar for caulking oil wine bizcocho bread
salted meats dried fruits lard bacon beans chickpeas lentils
flour garlic cheese honey rice salt
sugar food for months not enough food not enough water
chickens cows pigs up to one thousand souls
depending on whether the ship had a tonnage of 300 or 500
or 1000 or 2000 ships that in the 250 years
of the trade route wrecked somewhere along the way
more often than they arrived in Acapulco sailors
mercenaries officers noblemen and their entourages priests
and missionaries slaves that were called indios
or chinos nails tools iron cask hoops fireworks opals   elegy
 
3 We didn’t want to be noticed so we put charcoal on our faces 
I listen to the hours of tape of the two of us at the dining table All the girls looking like dirt   My father was always drinking
Questions about the town her parents the names of peopleor with women my mother had to take care of the business   
that only she could now remember  The images I imaginedMy sister broke her back when she was a child she grew up
scrolling in her mind and translated into the answers she gave into a hunchback  She died very young   They set up a dance
Sometimes pausing not because she couldn’t recall but didn’tat the municipal tennis courts to celebrate the end of the war
want to recall badly the pause a kind of gap between what sheand he was there in his US uniform   He always insisted that
knew and what the words could do  The two things a voicewe sit at the front but when I was by myself on the bus I sat
can say when it is saying one thing the things that suddenlysomewhere in the middle  I didn’t want trouble   I was around
return when you are speaking like pockets of color coming tofifty-five when I had my first real job working as the security
life in your mind I listen to her with my skin and my eyesat Macy’s   I always liked to read  I wanted to go to college
my ears  I had had the notion that asking her about her lifelike my sisters but I got married   You know that wedding
might add something to what I thought of as my art as thoughdress in the picture we had to borrow it from our neighbor   
her past and her love could be vectors of use  But I started toI liked Japan when he was stationed there  It was so clean 
realize that what I actually needed to know I would haveThen Norfolk  Richmond   I was so sick on the ship I can’t
to conjure for myself because what we know most deeplyremember much  Your mama just kept running all around 
we guard best even as she spoke laughed passed the glowIt was a navy ship   My mother’s name is Canuta Sacay and
of each story to me like a document I could have in handmy father’s name is Enrique Omega  My grandparents were
but could not understand  I put the tape away felt for yearsfarmers outside Ormoc   I was born in Ormoc December 8
that it was enough the responsibility done  Our conversation1924 or 25   This was the apartment we lived in in Maryland 
stopped when my aunt came to take her out for some errands That’s Junior there in the picture  And there’s your mama 
Chatter chairs moved around then noises that are just noises

In Madrid I orient myself     I walk on the wide boulevards
and know an empire is its boulevards     I stand below the angel
skeptical of the beauty of angels     at the royal gardens I count
the 138 kinds of dahlias     at the crystal palace I imagine
the exhibition of plants indigenous to my islands     I walk
up the street of the poets     read the bronze lines on the ground
the longing and song of the pirate     in one museum I stare
at Picasso’s lightbulb     in the oldest neighborhoods
I wonder if  José Rizal walked these streets     studying diseases
of the eye during the day     writing his novel in the night
in another museum I look     at the paintings of the dwarves
of  the horses     of  the undying fruit     in the train station
I visit the memorial for the murdered     in the great white
square at dawn I walk     inscribe myself  like letters on a page
at the naval museum I look into the face of  Magellan     show the
painting my face     I sing the neighborhoods of Huertas
and Chueca     maybe only in Madrid     is the light a gold
weight always     at the supermarket I overhear     two Filipinos
speaking and I turn away and break     I find myself in
the cathedral     in the movie theater     where I watch a movie
without understanding the words spoken     around a corner
I stop because a kind of meadow     has been grown on the side
of a building     like a tallness of heart     a dream carried
into waking     my life breathing before it     incredible and true
