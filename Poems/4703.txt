                         Remember when we almost drowned in ’03 the woods
            so thick we only knew the rainstorm by sound of thunder
and violence of the creek how every day I’d take you to the Stop-N-Go
                         for your case of Natty Lights Think back to summertime
            when after lunch you’d pull your shirt off and wring it in your hands
and count off one beer wring some more two beers how in July you’d sweat
                         all the way through last night’s binge  Think back to when
            we chopped paths across hardwood bottoms for skidders to plow
makeshift roads for Justiss Oil pumpjacks to suck black snot the earth
                         doesn’t blow  I wanted to call in sick every day to feel
            the sunrise through my bedroom pane instead of the company truck’s
windshield  But this isn’t about that  What was I Eighteen Drinking
                         creamy coffee the color of soupy dishwater the callouses
            of my hands sanding the white Styrofoam cup whiskey from a flask
stirred into yours  I grew to welcome the start of a day filing blades the rhythm
                         I’d find scraping down down up and over  I didn’t care
            like you did for squaring drill sites with double-knots of orange flagging
for the loggers how we kneeled panting in the dirt how you would pan your head
                          to take inventory of the beech and white oaks rooted inside
            the flagged-off square  I don’t know what it mattered Steve
which tree we marked for loggers to fell which sapling we ourselves chopped
                         with machetes  Did the thicket not return what we gave
            Did the thorn limbs and briars not cut your flesh into estuaries
of brackish pink creeks of sweat and blood Nothing changes much
                         does it Steve I’m filing a brush hook’s edge for the first time
            in years and still hear you yelling at me Not like that Smith  Just give
that damn thing to me
