
because a box is a box humans are cultivated
into said box without choice or clarification specimens
only existing as in you i us  flesh  frame 
restricted bone matter comprising a box reluctant
not to be a box  but nurtured inside the box let’s say
form which is shaped by  indigenous to the box 
the creator of the holy box only leading to another
question about of course the infamous box form
turns deceitful inside the box like any thing caged
leaning to a non-empathetic approach steeped in revolt
 is judas in waiting  note the box is not universal
nor the universal  whatever hopes of otherworldliness
lies in the box itself  the box will not elongate dissolve
or vanish without reaction to an action  here within
lies problem of perspective as in there is none zero 
along time’s continuum color too is encouraged
for the sake of the construction of the box which
is precious as flickering light but cannot be verified since
darkness is the original concept of all things human
