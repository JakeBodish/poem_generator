My meninas are as changeable as the moon Black and white and in color Happy sad and how many words there arefor red enough and the pallor of skin Their moments of verisimilitude do not outweightheir flashes of pathos  Whole days go bywhen they cannot appreciate the humorof which the dog is one manner the dwarf another My meninas are not puppets but puppet theaters That it is the puppet master who draws the curtainin the stairwell is pure whimsy on my part A minuet of despair andante of foolhardiness How many times have I tried to explain these differencesthe sting of  joy a lilt of crimsonthe dark and the light of the moon not the moonthe soul but a sphere predisposed to rotationThe man in the doorway  The dog who lies sleeping These are my meninas  The sun in the mirror The sun and the moon and the man behind the easelmostly invisible like the pictures on the wall The moon is not more changeable howeverthan they my meninas who never stop changingand waiting on the children of the sunand of the moon for they will always bemy meninas their eyes of every minim on the paletteblue and tragical white on white againsta black ground until the moon sings every shapeand shade of gray from hope to ample  And again
