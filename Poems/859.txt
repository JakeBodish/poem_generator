
When men shall find thy flower thy glory passAnd thou with careful brow sitting aloneReceived hast this message from thy glassThat tells thee truth and says that all is goneFresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou madestThough spent thy flame in me the heat remainingI that have lovd thee thus before thou fadestMy faith shall wax when thou art in thy waning The world shall find this miracle in meThat fire can burn when all the matters spentThen what my faith hath been thyself shall seeAnd that thou wast unkind thou mayst repent Thou mayst repent that thou hast scornd my tearsWhen winter snows upon thy golden hairs
