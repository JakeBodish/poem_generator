
I broke the spell that held me longThe dear dear witchery of song I said the poet’s idle loreShall waste my prime of years no moreFor Poetry though heavenly bornConsorts with poverty and scorn I broke the spell–nor deemed its powerCould fetter me another hour Ah thoughtless how could I forgetIts causes were around me yetFor wheresoe’er I looked the whileWas Nature’s everlasting smile Still came and lingered on my sightOf flowers and streams the bloom and lightAnd glory of the stars and sun –And these and poetry are one They ere the world had held me longRecalled me to the love of song
