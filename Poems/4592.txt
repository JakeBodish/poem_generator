
Grain by grain salt’s frozen tears
Help me count history’s disasters
I can’t blame salt for telling foodYou’re full of wounds
Salt misses the freedom of the ocean
Remembering waves salt jumps into a soup
But it finds there only my reflected face
It hides by making itself too soft to chew
Sometimes salt follows a cold sweat
Waking me from a nightmare
Dreamed blood tastes like salt
As if in human failure lay the silence of God
Having swum in the ocean
Salt considers soup a shallow pond
For salt every meal is a jail
One day an extra salty flavor
Makes me cough and cough
It feels like cold fish bones scraping my throat
Maybe it’s salt telling meI’m going to prison in your body
Don’t ever forget who I am
