
All afternoon I walk behind the mowerImagining though paradoxicallyThat even though the grass is getting lowerWhat I have cut is like a rising seaThe parts I haven’t cut with every passResemble real geography a mapA shrinking island continent of grassWhere shoreline vanishes with every lap At last the noise and smell of gasolineDispel my dream  What sea PeninsulasThey were the lands my inner child had seenTheir little Yucatáns and Floridas But when I’m finished and Yard goes back to LawnI can’t help thinking that a world is gone
