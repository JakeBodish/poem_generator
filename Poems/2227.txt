
Again this morning my eyes woke up too close
to your eyes
their almost green orbs
too heavy-lidded to really look back 
To wake up next to you
is ordinary  I do not even need to look at you
to see you 
But I do look  So when you come to me
in your opulent sadness I see
you do not want me
to unbutton you
so I cannot do the one thing
I can do 
Now it is almost one a m  I am still at my desk
and you are upstairs at your desk a staircase
away from me  Already it is years
of you a staircase
away from me  To be near you
and not near you
is ordinary 
You
are ordinary 
Still how many afternoons have I spent
peeling blue paint from
our porch steps peering above
hedgerows the few parked cars for the first
glimpse of you  How many hours under
the overgrown pink Camillas thinking
the color was wrong for you thinking
youd appear
after my next
blink 
Soon youll come down the stairs
to tell me something  And Ill say
okay  Okay  Ill say it
like that say it just like
that Ill go on being
your never-enough 
Its not the best in you
I long for  Its when youre noteless
numb at the ends of my fingers all is
all  I say it is
