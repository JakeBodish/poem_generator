december froze  may thawed bloodmisted crying for any mother the boywho called your mama a bitch bleedsour love for you his wings frozen  fighting
the cold wind of our sneakers we storm him because we love you your mama has fed us  only usis allowed to call her out her name
because we know her name Ms  Jones she bad  only we can say that when we bad she has permissionfrom our mamas to beat us like we hers 
we hers like you hers  you our boy we pool our punches into the boylike quarters for a bag of flaming hots we make him look like a bag of flaming hots 
lord forgive me but i don’t regret it  on the real all these summers lateri miss it  i wish a little bit to gather arounda man’s body  stomp in the name of love
beat what he said about my next to bloodback into his vermilion mouth to makehis mouth a beautiful smashed tomato really tho  Leland you remember
how we beat that nigga our middleschool ritual that thirty-second eternity later i licked his blood off my nikes dreamed we were water lilies

the fists that broke my ribs also wanted me to live i praise each one true godfor each foot that was nota sharp anything i had always wanted 8 niggas on me but not like that 
each hand laid upon me like a rude  starving prayer after a while i started to           like iti leaned into it      unblocked my face
the bottoms of their shoes were the sweet of a well-chewed eraser i was their promise  their ink you should have heard them laugha language so delicious i cracked up cracked grin  all

a thing about love
until those boys
walked away
so happy my heart pouring from my nose
