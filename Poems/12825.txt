
Pitch here the tent while the old horse grazes
    By the old hedge-side well halt a stage Its nigh my last above the daisies
    My next leafll be mans blank page Yes my old girl and its no use crying
    Juggler constable king must bow One that outjuggles alls been spying
    Long to have me and he has me now Weve travelled times to this old common
    Often weve hung our pots in the gorse Weve had a stirring life old woman
    You and I and the old grey horse Races and fairs and royal occasions
    Found us coming to their callNow theyll miss us at our stations
    Theres a Juggler outjuggles allUp goes the lark as if all were jolly
    Over the duck-pond the willow shakes Easy to think that grievings folly
    When the hands firm as driven stakesAy when were strong and braced and manful
    Lifes a sweet fiddle but were a batchBorn to become the Great Jugglers hanful
    Balls he shies up and is safe to catch Heres where the lads of the village cricket
    I was a lad not wide from hereCouldnt I whip off the bale from the wicket
    Like an old world those days appearDonkey sheep geese and thatchd ale-house I know them
    They are old friends of my halts and seemSomehow as if kind thanks I owe them
    Juggling dont hinder the hearts esteem Jugglings no sin for we must have victual
    Nature allows us to bait for the fool Holding ones own makes us juggle no little
    But to increase it hard jugglings the rule You that are sneering at my profession
    Havent you juggled a vast amountTheres the Prime Minister in one Session
    Juggles more games than my sinsll count Ive murdered insects with mock thunder
    Conscience for that in men dont quail Ive made bread from the bump of wonder
    Thats my business and theres my tale Fashion and rank all praised the professor
    Ay and Ive had my smile from the QueenBravo Jerry she meant God bless her
    Aint this a sermon on that sceneIve studied men from my topsy-turvy
    Close and I reckon rather true Some are fine fellows some right scurvy
    Most a dash between the two But its a woman old girl that makes me
    Think more kindly of the raceAnd its a woman old girl that shakes me
    When the Great Juggler I must face We two were married due and legal
    Honest weve lived since weve been one Lord I could then jump like an eagle
    You danced bright as a bit o the sun Birds in a May-bush we were right merry
    All night we kissd we juggled all day Joy was the heart of Juggling Jerry
    Now from his old girl hes juggled away Its past parsons to console us
    No nor no doctor fetch for meI can die without my bolus
    Two of a trade lass never agreeParson and Doctor dont they love rarely
    Fighting the devil in other mens fieldsStand up yourself and match him fairly
    Then see how the rascal yieldsI lass have lived no gipsy flaunting
    Finery while his poor helpmate grubsCoin Ive stored and you wont be wanting
    You shant beg from the troughs and tubs Nobly youve stuck to me though in his kitchen
    Many a Marquis would hail you CookPalaces you could have ruled and grown rich in
    But your old Jerry you never forsook Hand up the chirper ripe ale winks in it
    Lets have comfort and be at peace Once a stout draught made me light as a linnet 
    Cheer up the Lord must have his lease May be for none see in that black hollow 
    Its just a place where were held in pawnAnd when the Great Juggler makes as to swallow
    Its just the sword-trick I aint quite goneYonder came smells of the gorse so nutty
    Gold-like and warm its the prime of May Better than mortar brick and putty
    Is Gods house on a blowing day Lean me more up the mound now I feel it
    All the old heath-smells Aint it strangeTheres the world laughing as if to conceal it
    But Hes by us juggling the change I mind it well by the sea-beach lying
    Once its long gone when two gulls we beheldWhich as the moon got up were flying
    Down a big wave that sparked and swelld Crack went a gun one fell the second
    Wheeled round him twice and was off for new luckThere in the dark her white wing beckond 
    Drop me a kiss Im the bird dead-struck
