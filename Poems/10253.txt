throbbing brainIs from its first conception fraught   With gloom and darkness woe and pain From earliest youth my path has been   Cast in life’s darkest deepest shadeWhere no bright ray did intervene    Nor e’er a passing sunbeam strayedBut all was dark and cheerless night    Without one ray of hopeful light From childhood then through many a shock   I’ve battled with the ills of lifeTill like a rude and rugged rock   My heart grew callous in the strife When other children passed the hours   In mirth and play and childish gleeOr gathering the summer flowers   By gentle brook or flowery leaI sought the wild and rugged glen   Where Nature in her sternest mood Far from the busy haunts of men   Frowned in the darksome solitude There have I mused till gloomy night   Like the death-angel’s brooding wingWould shut out every thing from sight   And o’er the scene her mantle flingAnd seeking then my lonely bed   To pass the night in sweet reposeAround my fevered burning head   Dark visions of the night aroseAnd the stern scenes which day had viewed   In sterner aspect rose before meAnd specters of still sterner mood   Waved their menacing fingers o’er me When the dark storm-fiend soared abroad   And swept to earth the waving grainOn whirlwind through the forest rode   And stirred to foam the heaving mainI loved to mark the lightning’s flash   And listen to the ocean’s roarOr hear the pealing thunder’s crash   And see the mountain torrents pourDown precipices dark and steep   Still bearing in their headlong courseTo meet th’ embrace of ocean deep   Mementoes of the tempest’s forceFor fire and tempest flood and storm   Wakened deep echoes in my soulAnd made the quickening life-blood warm   With impulse that knew no controlAnd the fierce lightning’s lurid flash   Rending the somber clouds asunderFollowed by the terrific crash    Which marks the hoarsely rattling thunder Seemed like the gleams of lurid light   Which flashed across my seething brainSucceeded by a darker night   With wilder horrors in its train And I have stood on ocean’s shore   And viewed its dreary waters roll Till the dull music of its roar   Called forth responses in my soulAnd I have felt that there was traced   An image of my inmost soulIn that dark dreary boundless waste   Whose sluggish waters aimless roll Save when aroused by storms’ wild force   It lifts on high its angry wave And thousands driven from their course   Find in its depths a nameless grave Whene’er I turned in gentler mood   To scan the old historic pageIt was not where the wise and good   The Bard the Statesman or the Sage Had drawn in lines of living light Lessons of virtue truth and rightBut that which told of secret league   Where deep conspiracies were rifeAnd where through foul and dark intrigue   Were sowed the seeds of deadly strife Where hostile armies met to seal   Their country’s doom for woe or wealWhere the grim-visaged death-fiend drank   His full supply of human goreAnd poured through every hostile rank   The tide of battle’s awful roarFor then my spirit seemed to soar   Away to where such scenes were rifeAnd high above the battle’s roar   Sit as spectator of the strife And in those scenes of war and woeA fierce and fitful pleasure know There was a time when I possessed   High notions of Religion’s claimNor deemed its practice at the best   Was but a false and empty nameBut when I saw the graceless deeds   Which marked its strongest votaries’ pathHow senseless bigots o’er their creeds   Blazing with wild fanatic wrathLet loose the deadly tide of warSpread devastation near and far Through scenes of rapine blood and shameOf cities sacked and towns on flameCaused unbelievers’ hearts to feelThe arguments of fire and steelBy which they sought t’ enforce the word   And make rebellious hearts approveThose arguments of fire and sword   As mandates of the God of love How could I think that such a faith   Whose path was marked by fire and bloodThat sowed the seeds of war and death   Had issued from a holy GodThere was a time when I did love   Such love as those alone can knowWhose blood like burning lava moves   Whose passions like the lightning glowAnd when that ardent truthful love   Was blighted in its opening bloomAnd all around below above   Seemed like the darkness of the tomb’Twas then my stern and callous heartRiven in its most vital partSeemed like some gnarled and knotted oakThat shivered by the lightning’s strokeStands in the lonely wanderer’s pathA ghastly monument of wrath Then how can I attune the lyre   To strains of love or joyous gleeBreak forth in patriotic fire   Or soar on higher minstrelsyTo sing the praise of virtue brightCondemn the wrong and laud the rightWhen neither vice nor guilt can fling   A darker shadow o’er my breastNot even Virtue’s self can bring   Unto my moody spirit rest It may not be it cannot be   Let others strike the sounding stringAnd in rich strains of harmony   Songs of poetic beauty singBut mine must still the portion be   However dark and drear the doomTo live estranged from sympathy   Buried in doubt despair and gloomTo bare my breast to every blowTo know no friend and fear no foeEach generous impulse trod to dustEach noble aspiration crushed Each feeling struck with withering blightWith no regard for wrong or rightNo fear of hell no hope of heaven Die all unwept and unforgivenContent to know and dare the worstWhich mankind’s hate and heaven’s curseCan heap upon my living headOr cast around my memory deadAnd let them on my tombstone traceHere lies the Pariah of his race
