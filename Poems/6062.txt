
When he speaks of deserved and undeserved as more
than terms   how they can matter suddenly   I can tell
he believes it  Sometimes a thing can seem star-like
when it’s just a star stripped of whatever small form of joy
likeness equals  Sometimes the thought that I’m doomed
to fail   that the body is   keeps me almost steady if
steadiness is what a gift for a while brings   feathers burst-
at-last pods of milkweed October   before it all fades away 
Before the drugs and the loud music before tears and
restraining orders and the eventual go fuck yourself get your
ass out of here don’t go
