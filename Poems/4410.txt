
Two men share
one tooth  From
one tooth the men
predict the world 
Thank you or
we would not exist 
Two men and one
tooth is not a problem 
One man is wide
and one man is sober 
Sometimes the men are
the same  Little tooth
is the light of the
orchard  From
it all things are
made up  Once
the two men lost
the tooth and every
one disappeared 
No one was angry
because no one was
there  The men
found the tooth
when the tooth
started laughing 
The men said what
is that noise and
the world came
back on  They told
the tooth that’s not
funny but it was
very funny  One
man swallowed
the tooth and put
on all the sad
knowledge 
He wanted to
punish the tooth
but the tooth
punished him  It
lasted three hours
and then he threw
up  The two men
live in a cave with
bay windows  To
be in love is so
solemn think the
two men once
a year  The tooth
never thinks any
thing  It is the
tooth of a goat
