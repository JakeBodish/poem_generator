One dies Eschrichtius
           robustus gray
           of the sole living genus of  baleen
of the family
Eschrichtiidae slate
           gray or darker
           and notable now for
gray-white patterned scars
left by parasites two
           blowholes “which can
           create a distinctive
V-shaped
blow     in calm wind conditions”
           and falls as
           it falls as through blue breeze
and swirls light
as a tissue drifting down 
           down through
           the cool layers the sifted light
of sea-wind-
warmed currents loose galaxy
           of whirling flecks slow-
           motion in a haze
in whose first stage falling
now the “mobile
           scavengers” drift alongside
           sleeper sharks
and thin hagfish
 or as the book calls them
           “enrichment opportunists” 
           come to feed
at the soft flanks and fat
for weeks as the
           bones grow exposed all
           of them spinning down

We might hear rain before the rain  Sirens 
Hail before it cracked the hundred panes 
Or lay our heads on the desks and listen
to our blood whispering in the woodgrain 
In 1963 the warnings are
piecemeal part of the good day’s play or work 
We might need to cover our heads  Hold hands
in the hallway  Look away from the blast 
 
July 29 2013 a sperm whale found deceased on the beach of
a small island off the coast of the Netherlands had dozens of
plastics bags nine meters of rope two long pieces of garden hose
a couple of flower pots and a plastic spray canister in its stomach 
 
I’m watching a hummingbird bare thumb-
top gray-green blur dip to my feeder bulb
and dart off over the barn to a wire A  colubrus  Little serpent  I hear
the burr of wings and already it’s back 
dips again hovers there sips now attacks
the tube of red sugar-water until
bubbles aerate like an aneurism 
 
June 28 2016 an 80-foot blue whale Balaenoptera musculus
caught in 200 feet of fishnet crab lines channel buoys off the
coast of Orange County lines cut through its mouth wrapped
its fins  “Blue whales are typically thought to be more offshore
animals and crabbing gear is thought to be more inshore but
obviously the spatial overlap between those two is coming into
conflict” explained Leigh Torres  “The fact that we see this
entanglement isn’t terribly surprising though it is unique ”
 
Weeks I couldn’t sleep  Years I couldn’t waken 
I found a note I’d written one ill night pines shredded      ice snow
                                                 such wind
        rips the night
I run my tongue above my tooth aching 
And know it’s coming back once more  The warning
 right cuspid gum swollen puffed as a pea 
two days before the viral fire the toxic sea     
 
March 23 2016 13 sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus
beached themselves off the shallow coast at Tönning Germany
“We may never know the exact cause” wrote Danny Groves 
Stomach contents 43 feet of fishing net 100 plastic bags
golf balls sweatpants greenhouse glass sheeting cigarette
butts hypodermic needles a plastic car engine cover a bucket     
 
Cottonwood seeds  Gnats’ wings in the sunlight 
Whirl of dust motes in the haze of still light 
If it were so simple as to drift down 
If it were so easy as getting up again 
Little bug little serpent  The air slows
with summer thickness when you fly away 
And the feeder bobs there like a red buoy
on the green waters of a distant bay

I have been silent for a long time now 
You know I am serious about the whales 
You don’t know this  I floated there in stillness
in white sheets  White boughs breaking  The pines
in ice and wind like a hammering pulse 
When I woke I couldn’t speak or make sense 
And when I slept again I didn’t sleep 
And more fires spreading through the body’s depths 
 
“Plastic Garbage Patch Bigger Than Mexico Found in Pacific ”National Geographic These pieces of plastic are not necessarily
floating bottles bags and buoys but “teeny-tiny pieces of plastic resembling
confetti ” 90 of sea birds consume it  “Over eight million tons of new plastic
trash finding its way into the oceans every year ”
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch moves in a clockwise direction
like a toilet  It circulates an area of 7 7 million square miles 
“70 of marine debris sinks to the bottom of the ocean ”New York Times Plastiglomerate was “discovered” by Charles Moore
a sea captain surveying plastic washed up on a remote polluted
stretch of sand on Hawaii’s Big Island  It is a new stone a fusion
of natural and manufactured materials  “If plastiglomerates are
buried within the strata” says Jan Zalasiewicz an English geologist
“I don’t see why they can’t persist in some form for millions of years ”

Aggregates increase “like snow ” Aggregation theory represents
a two-state system “time for chemistry kids”     to characterize
the formation of marine aggregates and the loss due to sinking
 
  
where· C1 is the concentration of the cells· r is the radius of each cell· G is the shearing rate· α is the stickiness coefficient· g is the growth rate 
Thus aggregation of marine particles is more prevalent when
cell and particle concentration is higher e g  algal blooms

Wikipedia marine snow is a variety of mostly organic matter
including dead or dying animals and plankton     also plant parts
and degrading plant material  Because of the relatively long
residence time of the ocean’s thermohaline circulation carbon
transported as marine snow into the aphotic zone by the biological
pump can remain out of contact     for more than a thousand years A blue jay lands in the fringe tree  Sudden downfall of petals 
The massive galaxy of matter as the body floats down through
