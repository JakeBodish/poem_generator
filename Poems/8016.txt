
I
Eventually we must combine nightmares
an angel smoking a cigarette on the steps
of the last national bank said to me 
I put her out with my thumb  I don’t need that
cheap talk I’ve got my own problems 
It was sad exciting and horrible 
It was exciting horrible and sad 
It was horrible sad and exciting 
It was inviting mad and deplorable 
It was adorable glad and enticing 
Eventually we must smoke a thumb
cheap talk I’ve got my own angel
on the steps of the problems the bank
said to me I don’t need that 
I will take this one window
with its sooty maps and scratches
so that my dreams will remember
one another and so that my eyes will not
become blinded by the new world 
II
The flames don’t dance or slither 
They have painted the room green 
Beautiful and naked the wives
are sleeping before the fire 
Now it is out  The men have
returned to the shacks
slaved creatures from the forest
floor across their white
stationwagons  That just about
does it says the other
dumping her bucket
over her head  Well I guess
we got everything says one
feeling around in the mud
as if for a child 
Now they remember they want
that mud who can’t remember
what they got up for 
They parcel it out when
they are drunk enough
they go into town with
a bucket of mud sayingwe can slice it up into
windmills like a bloated cow
