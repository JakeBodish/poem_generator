
There’s blue and then there’s blue A number not a hue this blueis not the undertone of any onebut there it is primary I held the bouquetin shock and cut the stems at a deadly angle I opened the toxic sachet of flower foodwith my canine and rinsed my mouth I used to wash my hands and daydream I dreamed of myself and washedmy hands of everything  Easy math Now I can’t get their procedureat the florist off my mind The white flowers arrived They overnightedin a chemical bathand now they have a fake laughthat catches like a matchthat starts the kind of kitchen firethat is fanned by water They won’t even look at me Happy Anniversary
