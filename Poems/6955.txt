
I had a dream which was not all a dream The bright sun was extinguishd and the starsDid wander darkling in the eternal spaceRayless and pathless and the icy earthSwung blind and blackening in the moonless airMorn came and went and came and brought no dayAnd men forgot their passions in the dreadOf this their desolation and all heartsWere chilld into a selfish prayer for lightAnd they did live by watchfires and the thronesThe palaces of crowned kings the hutsThe habitations of all things which dwellWere burnt for beacons cities were consumdAnd men were gatherd round their blazing homesTo look once more into each others faceHappy were those who dwelt within the eyeOf the volcanos and their mountain-torchA fearful hope was all the world containdForests were set on fire but hour by hourThey fell and faded and the crackling trunksExtinguishd with a crash and all was black The brows of men by the despairing lightWore an unearthly aspect as by fitsThe flashes fell upon them some lay downAnd hid their eyes and wept and some did restTheir chins upon their clenched hands and smildAnd others hurried to and fro and fedTheir funeral piles with fuel and lookd upWith mad disquietude on the dull skyThe pall of a past world and then againWith curses cast them down upon the dustAnd gnashd their teeth and howld the wild birds shriekdAnd terrified did flutter on the groundAnd flap their useless wings the wildest brutesCame tame and tremulous and vipers crawldAnd twind themselves among the multitudeHissing but stingless they were slain for food And War which for a moment was no moreDid glut himself again a meal was boughtWith blood and each sate sullenly apartGorging himself in gloom no love was leftAll earth was but one thought and that was deathImmediate and inglorious and the pangOf famine fed upon all entrails menDied and their bones were tombless as their fleshThe meagre by the meagre were devourdEven dogs assaild their masters all save oneAnd he was faithful to a corse and keptThe birds and beasts and famishd men at bayTill hunger clung them or the dropping deadLurd their lank jaws himself sought out no foodBut with a piteous and perpetual moanAnd a quick desolate cry licking the handWhich answerd not with a caress he died The crowd was famishd by degrees but twoOf an enormous city did surviveAnd they were enemies they met besideThe dying embers of an altar-placeWhere had been heapd a mass of holy things
 For an unholy usage they rakd upAnd shivering scrapd with their cold skeleton handsThe feeble ashes and their feeble breathBlew for a little life and made a flameWhich was a mockery then they lifted upTheir eyes as it grew lighter and beheldEach others aspects saw and shriekd and died Even of their mutual hideousness they diedUnknowing who he was upon whose browFamine had written Fiend  The world was voidThe populous and the powerful was a lumpSeasonless herbless treeless manless lifeless A lump of death a chaos of hard clay The rivers lakes and ocean all stood stillAnd nothing stirrd within their silent depthsShips sailorless lay rotting on the seaAnd their masts fell down piecemeal as they droppdThey slept on the abyss without a surge The waves were dead the tides were in their graveThe moon their mistress had expird beforeThe winds were witherd in the stagnant airAnd the clouds perishd Darkness had no needOf aid from them She was the Universe
