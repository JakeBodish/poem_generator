
 I burned my life that I might find
A passion wholly of the mind
Thought divorced from eye and bone
Ecstasy come to breath alone 
I broke my life to seek relief
From the flawed light of love and grief 
 
With mounting beat the utter fire
Charred existence and desire 
It died low ceased its sudden thresh 
I had found unmysterious flesh 
Not the mind’s avid substance still
Passionate beyond the will
