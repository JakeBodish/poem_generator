
we are watching a documentary about home
birth when you first feel neni kick  embryo
 
of hope  they say plastic is the perfect creation
because it never dies  litters the beaches
 
of o‘ahu this “gathering place”  the doctor
recommends a c-section  in the sea plastic multiplies
 
into smaller pieces leaches estrogenic and toxic
chemicals  if we cut open the bellies of whales
 
and large fish what fragments will we find derived
from oil absorbed into tissue  because plastic
 
never dissolves every product ever made still exists
somewhere today  i wish my daughter was made
 
of plastic so that she will survive our wasteful
hands  so that she too will have a great future
