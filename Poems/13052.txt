
When the breeze of a joyful dawn blew freeIn the silken sail of infancyThe tide of time flowd back with me
   The forward-flowing tide of timeAnd many a sheeny summer-mornAdown the Tigris I was borneBy Bagdats shrines of fretted goldHigh-walled gardens green and oldTrue Mussulman was I and sworn
   For it was in the golden prime
       Of good Haroun Alraschid Anight my shallop rustling throThe low and bloomed foliage droveThe fragrant glistening deeps and cloveThe citron-shadows in the blueBy garden porches on the brimThe costly doors flung open wideGold glittering thro lamplight dimAnd broiderd sofas on each side
   In sooth it was a goodly time
   For it was in the golden prime
       Of good Haroun Alraschid Often where clear-stemmd platans guardThe outlet did I turn awayThe boat-head down a broad canalFrom the main river sluiced where allThe sloping of the moon-lit swardWas damask-work and deep inlayOf braided blooms unmown which creptAdown to where the water slept 
   A goodly place a goodly time
   For it was in the golden prime
       Of good Haroun Alraschid A motion from the river wonRidged the smooth level bearing onMy shallop thro the star-strown calmUntil another night in nightI enterd from the clearer lightImbowerd vaults of pillard palmImprisoning sweets which as they clombHeavenward were stayd beneath the dome
   Of hollow boughs  A goodly time
   For it was in the golden prime
       Of good Haroun Alraschid Still onward and the clear canalIs rounded to as clear a lake From the green rivage many a fallOf diamond rillets musicalThro little crystal arches lowDown from the central fountains flowFalln silver-chiming seemd to shakeThe sparkling flints beneath the prow 
   A goodly place a goodly time
   For it was in the golden prime
       Of good Haroun Alraschid Above thro many a bowery turnA walk with vary-colourd shellsWanderd engraind  On either sideAll round about the fragrant margeFrom fluted vase and brazen urnIn order eastern flowers largeSome dropping low their crimson bellsHalf-closed and others studded wide
   With disks and tiars fed the time
   With odour in the golden prime
       Of good Haroun Alraschid Far off and where the lemon-groveIn closest coverture upsprungThe living airs of middle nightDied round the bulbul as he sungNot he but something which possessdThe darkness of the world delightLife anguish death immortal loveCeasing not mingled unrepressd
   Apart from place withholding time
   But flattering the golden prime
       Of good Haroun Alraschid Black the garden-bowers and grotsSlumberd the solemn palms were rangedAbove unwood of summer windA sudden splendour from behindFlushd all the leaves with rich gold-greenAnd flowing rapidly betweenTheir interspaces counterchangedThe level lake with diamond-plots
   Of dark and bright  A lovely time
   For it was in the golden prime
       Of good Haroun Alraschid Dark-blue the deep sphere overheadDistinct with vivid stars inlaidGrew darker from that under-flameSo leaping lightly from the boatWith silver anchor left afloatIn marvel whence that glory cameUpon me as in sleep I sankIn cool soft turf upon the bank
   Entranced with that place and time
   So worthy of the golden prime
       Of good Haroun Alraschid Thence thro the garden I was drawn A realm of pleasance many a moundAnd many a shadow-chequerd lawnFull of the citys stilly soundAnd deep myrrh-thickets blowing roundThe stately cedar tamarisksThick rosaries of scented thornTall orient shrubs and obelisks
   Graven with emblems of the time
   In honour of the golden prime
       Of good Haroun Alraschid With dazed vision unawaresFrom the long alleys latticed shadeEmerged I came upon the greatPavilion of the Caliphat Right to the carven cedarn doorsFlung inward over spangled floorsBroad-based flights of marble stairsRan up with golden balustrade
   After the fashion of the time
   And humour of the golden prime
       Of good Haroun Alraschid The fourscore windows all alightAs with the quintessence of flameA million tapers flaring brightFrom twisted silvers lookd to shameThe hollow-vaulted dark and streamdUpon the mooned domes aloofIn inmost Bagdat till there seemdHundreds of crescents on the roof
   Of night new-risen that marvellous time
   To celebrate the golden prime
       Of good Haroun Alraschid Then stole I up and trancedlyGazed on the Persian girl aloneSerene with argent-lidded eyesAmorous and lashes like to raysOf darkness and a brow of pearlTressed with redolent ebonyIn many a dark delicious curlFlowing beneath her rose-hued zone
   The sweetest lady of the time
   Well worthy of the golden prime
       Of good Haroun Alraschid Six columns three on either sidePure silver underpropt a richThrone of the massive ore from whichDown-droopd in many a floating foldEngarlanded and diaperdWith inwrought flowers a cloth of gold Thereon his deep eye laughter-stirrdWith merriment of kingly pride
   Sole star of all that place and time
   I saw him in his golden prime
       THE GOOD HAROUN ALRASCHID
