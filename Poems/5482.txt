
The rain is hauntedI had forgotten My children are two hours abedAnd yet I riseHearing behind the typing of the rainIts abacus and digitsA voice calling me againSofter clearer The kids lie buried under duvets soundAsleep  It isn’t them I hear it’sSomething formless that fidgetsBeyond the window’s benighted mirrorWhere a negative develops where reflectionHolds up a glass of spirits White noisePrecipitates Rain is a kind of recollection Much has been shedHissing indignantly into the ground It is the listeningBelatesHaunted by these fingertaps and sighsBehind the beaded-curtain glisteningAs though by choices that we didn’t make and never wantedAs though by the dead and misbegotten
