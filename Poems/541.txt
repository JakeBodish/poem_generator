
The wall of identical boxes into which
our Aunt Sticky sorted the daily mail
was at the far end of her dining room
and from the private side looked like
a fancy wallpaper upon which peonies
pushed through a white wooden trellis
or sometimes like crates of chickens
stacked all the way to the ceiling 
Id learned by then – I was a little boy –
that a thing can look like one thing
on one day and another on another
depending on how you might be feeling 
There were times when we were there
having our coffee and sweet rolls
when some woman on the lobby side
would with a click unlock her box
and leaning down peer inside to see
if she had mail and see us at the table
Mother and Father my sister and I
and our postmistress aunt and call out
Yoohoo Sticky I see you have company
and waggle her fingers waving hello
