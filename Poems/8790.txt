
Crashing
again Basquiat
sends fenders
 letters headlong
into each other
the future  Fusion 
AAAAAAAAAAA 
Big Bang  The Big
Apple Atoms
behind him 
no sirens
in sight  His career
of careening
since at six 
playing stickball
a car stole
his spleen  Blind
sided  Move
along folks nothing
to see here  Driven
does two Caddys
colliding biting
the dust hes begun
to snort  Hit
 run  Red
Cross the pill-pale
ambulance inside
out he hitched
to the hospital 
Joy ride  Hot
wired  O the rush
before the wreck 
each Cadillac
a Titanic
an iceberg thats met
its match cabin
flooded
like an engine
drawing even
dark Shine
from below deck 
FLATS FIX  Chop
shop  Body work
while-u-wait  In situ
the spleen
or lien anterior view
