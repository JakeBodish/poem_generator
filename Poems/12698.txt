Calm was the even and clear was the sky       And the new budding flowers did spring When all alone went Amyntas and I       To hear the sweet nightingale sing I sate and he laid him down by me       But scarcely his breath he could draw For when with a fear he began to draw near       He was dashd with A ha ha ha ha He blushd to himself and lay still for a while       And his modesty curbd his desire But straight I convincd all his fear with a smile       Which added new flames to his fire  O Silvia said he you are cruel       To keep your poor lover in awe Then once more he pressd with his hand to my breast       But was dashd with A ha ha ha ha I knew twas his passion that causd all his fear       And therefore I pitied his case I whisperd him softly theres nobody near       And laid my cheek close to his face But as he grew bolder and bolder       A shepherd came by us and saw And just as our bliss we began with a kiss       He laughd out with A ha ha ha ha
