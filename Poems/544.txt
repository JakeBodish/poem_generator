
The ground cracked
like the rough pit of a peach
and snapped in two 
The sun behind the mountains
turned into an olive-green glow 
 
To niña Gloria this was home 
She continued to sell her bowl of lemons
rubbing a cold thin silver Christ
pocketed in her apron  Others
like Lito and Marvin played
soldiers in the ruins of a school
running around mounds of bricks
          shooting chickens and pigs 
 
No one knows exactly how
a light film of ash appeared
on everyone’s eyelids
          early in the morning
or how trout and mackerel plunged from the sky
twitched leaped through the streets 
 
Some say the skin of trees
felt like old newspaper dry and yellow 
Others believe the soapsuds
washed aside in rivers
began to rise in their milk 
 
One Monday morning a rain fell
and the cemetery washed into the city 
Bones began to knock
              and knock at our doors 
Streets became muddy rivers
waiting for bodies to drop
              among piles of dead fish 
 
In a year everyone stabbed flowers on a grave 
 
This explains why women thought
and moved like lizards under stones
why men heard bees buzzing inside their skulls
why dogs lost their sense of smell
sniffing piles of rubble to get back home 
 
In a few years no one cared
about turtles banging their heads against rocks
bulls with their sad busted eyes
parrots that kept diving into creeks
the dark swelling of the open ground
              or at night a knife
              stained the kitchen cloth 
 
Instead niña Gloria swept the ground
the broom licking her feet at each stroke 
 
At the bus station Marvin shined
military boots
              twenty-five cents a pair
reduced his words to a spit a splutter
of broken sentences
             on shoe polish leather 
 
In the evenings he counted coins
he’d tossed in a jar then walked home
one step closer to the cracked bone
clenched in the yellow jaw of a dog
