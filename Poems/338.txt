
For all
the pain
 
passed down
the genes
 
or latent
in the very grain
 
of being
for the lordless
 
mornings
the smear
 
of spirit
words intuit
 
and inter
for all
 
the nightfall
neverness
 
inking
into me
even now
my prayer
 
is that a mind
blurred
 
by anxiety
or despair
 
might find
here
 
a trace
of peace
