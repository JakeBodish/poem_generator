
I am dreaming of a house just like this onebut larger and opener to the trees nighterthan day and higher than noon and youvisiting knocking to get in hoping for icymilk or hot tea or whatever it is you like  For each night is a long drink in a short glass  A drink of blacksound water such a rush and fall of lonesome no form can contain it And if it isn’t night yet though I seem to recall that it is then it is not for everyone Did you receive my invitation It is not for everyone  Please come to my houselit by leaf light  It’s like a book with brightpages filled with flocks and glens and grovesand overlooked by Pan that seductive satyrin whom the fish is also cooked  A book that took too long to read but minutes to unread that is to forget  Strange are the pages thus  Nothing but the hope of company I made too much pie in expectation  I was hoping to sit with you in a tree house in a nightgown in a real way  Did you receivemy invitation Written in haste before leaf blinked out before the idea fully formed An idea like a storm cloud that does not spillor arrive but moves silently in a direction  Like a dark book in a long life with a vaguehope in a wood house with an open door
