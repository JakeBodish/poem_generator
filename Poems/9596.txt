
1    Dear Milton
      Rain  But when you are here alone what does it
      mean  It means psalm   that song sung to the harp 
      Like trees we too hold on to the earth   pull and
      twang for another tongue  It whatever it is and
      who knows that is a sacred song  It is strange for
      we are the ones who glorify mystery with our arms 
      We call it testament because it pries at our souls
      with many branches and so you say with a huge
      eye we must practice our art like the third stomach
      of a cud-chewing animal
                     “Myrtle Woodbine Appletrees Trillium
                      here they are the strength of your arm
                      stalls at the open gate of the stars 
                      Feel everything trust everything”
