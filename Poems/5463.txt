I’m in the barricade hearing the clock thickening you     Autumn encircles a confusion that’s nothing new Flash back to warring eyes almost letting me drown Out of which a picture of me walking in a foreign head      I can’t hear what you said  Then you say Cold roomthe second that life unwinds  A tinctured vase returnsto grass  Secrets doled out deep inside a drum beat out     of time  Whatever you said was ghostly slow likea second hand unwinding by match light  Lying backto the wheel I shirked confusion  You already knew      Suitcases surround me  You picture me too far ahead Yet I can’t hear what you’ve said  You say Doldrumssome secondhand wine  Love you knew my precincts      The stone house turned out black the scenic tunicswere deep inside  Who said home Oh I fall behind That very secret height blinds  Lying like a diamond     the cock-thickening of you hunchbacked arms eyesleft behind  You’ll picture me walking far far ahead I hear what you’ve done  You said Go slow  I feebly     bleed out  Matthew’s sermon turned out to be glass I wander in windows soft as Sour Patch  No rewind But something is out of touch and you you’re Sinbad      That second date totally mine  Lying in a vacuumthe thickening plot thinks of you  The future’s not new touchdown  Lights  All those celebrity behinds      A suitcase full of weeds  You picture me coming to You too close to me to hear what you’ve already said Then you say The second wind unwinds  Doves whistle     halving their dovely backs watching out windows to seeif I’m okay  See it the dulcet moment I’m like thickettinkering for you  Fusion nothing you knew  Flash back     to seagull-beguiled eyes  Sometimes talking to a barrenlad  Such music so unbearably droll  The hand is mine Random picture frames off the darkness  A Turing machine     Scotch-taping through windows stolen from deep insiderum-beaded thyme  You say also Behind sequins  hinds      And I’m in the barricade hearing the clock thickening you      Clematis enclosures walking with news pollinated by a secondary grief while something reminds you of our love
