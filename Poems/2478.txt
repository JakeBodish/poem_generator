
For sleeplessness your head face down your shoulder blades
floating and aspirin as a last resort when
death is threatening though lately I have experimented
with numbers and as for dreams Ive never been boring
and only once did I bite the arm of a woman
sitting next to me and I should be careful
she might have a hand-written poem or a memoir
and didnt I bite her arm and arent we both
poets though I warn her that I make gurgling
noises and twitch in both legs and make the bed
jump and I am exhausted from looking at poems
and I dont care about her nuts and bolts
and she has to go to the wilderness herself
and fuck the exercises let her get smashed
by a Mack truck then shell be ready to mourn
