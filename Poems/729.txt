dead in her car trunk her mother was alcoholic
and hers a suicide her daughter killed by an uncle
and hers stayed alive thanks to prison 
Before the term date-raped she was  Beforedomestic violence love punched her face 
 
We wanted the career  Not just skills and money
but structure focus printed plans the rowdy order
of raising buildings that years later would still stand
right where you left them  We joined a tradition
expected a well-marked path and a welcome 
The earnest ads never mentioned
 
we’d be human minesweepers steering around
barricades sinkholes lethal instructions We learned
Solidarity was a corporation privately held 
Some left in shock  Some were maimed 
Some went missing  A few found gold 
 
Those with talent for sifting real threat from bluff
or detecting hair-triggers before the blast fared best
We taught ourselves to disarm booby traps shared
hand-drawn maps and prepared for a long winter 
We lied on postcards home
