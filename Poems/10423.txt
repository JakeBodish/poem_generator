
Take this kiss upon the browAnd in parting from you nowThus much let me avow  You are not wrong who deemThat my days have been a dreamYet if hope has flown awayIn a night or in a dayIn a vision or in noneIs it therefore the less gone  All that we see or seemIs but a dream within a dream I stand amid the roarOf a surf-tormented shoreAnd I hold within my handGrains of the golden sand  How few yet how they creepThrough my fingers to the deepWhile I weep   while I weepO God Can I not grasp Them with a tighter claspO God can I not saveOne from the pitiless waveIs all that we see or seemBut a dream within a dream
