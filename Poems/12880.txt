
May I for my own self songs truth reckonJourneys jargon how I in harsh daysHardship endured oft Bitter breast-cares have I abidedKnown on my keel many a cares holdAnd dire sea-surge and there I oft spentNarrow nightwatch nigh the ships headWhile she tossed close to cliffs  Coldly afflictedMy feet were by frost benumbed Chill its chains are chafing sighsHew my heart round and hunger begotMere-weary mood  Lest man know notThat he on dry land loveliest livethList how I care-wretched on ice-cold seaWeathered the winter wretched outcastDeprived of my kinsmenHung with hard ice-flakes where hail-scur flewThere I heard naught save the harsh seaAnd ice-cold wave at whiles the swan criesDid for my games the gannets clamourSea-fowls loudness was for me laughterThe mews singing all my mead-drink Storms on the stone-cliffs beaten fell on the sternIn icy feathers full oft the eagle screamedWith spray on his pinion 
             Not any protectorMay make merry man faring needy This he little believes who aye in winsome lifeAbides mid burghers some heavy businessWealthy and wine-flushed how I weary oftMust bide above brine Neareth nightshade snoweth from northFrost froze the land hail fell on earth thenCorn of the coldest  Nathless there knocketh nowThe hearts thought that I on high streamsThe salt-wavy tumult traverse alone Moaneth alway my minds lustThat I fare forth that I afar henceSeek out a foreign fastness For this theres no mood-lofty man over earths midstNot though he be given his good but will have in his youth greedNor his deed to the daring nor his king to the faithfulBut shall have his sorrow for sea-fareWhatever his lord will He hath not heart for harping nor in ring-havingNor winsomeness to wife nor worlds delightNor any whit else save the waves slashYet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water Bosque taketh blossom cometh beauty of berriesFields to fairness land fares briskerAll this admonisheth man eager of moodThe heart turns to travel so that he then thinksOn flood-ways to be far departing Cuckoo calleth with gloomy cryingHe singeth summerward bodeth sorrowThe bitter hearts blood  Burgher knows not  He the prosperous man   what some performWhere wandering them widest draweth So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lockMy mood mid the mere-floodOver the whales acre would wander wide On earths shelter cometh oft to meEager and ready the crying lone-flyerWhets for the whale-path the heart irresistiblyOer tracks of ocean seeing that anyhowMy lord deems to me this dead lifeOn loan and on land I believe notThat any earth-weal eternal standethSave there be somewhat calamitousThat ere a mans tide go turn it to twain Disease or oldness or sword-hateBeats out the breath from doom-gripped body And for this every earl whatever for those speaking after  Laud of the living boasteth some last wordThat he will work ere he pass onwardFrame on the fair earth gainst foes his maliceDaring ado    So that all men shall honour him afterAnd his laud beyond them remain mid the EnglishAye for ever a lasting lifes-blastDelight mid the doughty 
             Days little durableAnd all arrogance of earthen richesThere come now no kings nor CæsarsNor gold-giving lords like those gone Howeer in mirth most magnifiedWhoeer lived in life most lordliestDrear all this excellence delights undurableWaneth the watch but the world holdeth Tomb hideth trouble  The blade is layed low Earthly glory ageth and seareth No man at all going the earths gaitBut age fares against him his face palethGrey-haired he groaneth knows gone companionsLordly men are to earth oergivenNor may he then the flesh-cover whose life ceasethNor eat the sweet nor feel the sorryNor stir hand nor think in mid heartAnd though he strew the grave with goldHis born brothers their buried bodiesBe an unlikely treasure hoard
