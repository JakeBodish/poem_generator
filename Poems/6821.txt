
Absolute zero the locust sings
summer’s caught in eternity’s rings
the rock explodes the planet dies
we shovel up our verities 
The razor rasps across the face
and in the glass our fleeting race
lit by infinity’s lightning wink
under the thunder tries to think 
In this frail gourd the granite pours
the timeless howls like all outdoors
the sensuous moment builds a wall
open as wind no wall at all
while still obedient to valves and knobs
the vascular jukebox throbs and sobs
expounding hope propounding yearning
proposing love but never learning
or only learning at zero’s gate
like summer’s locust the final hate
formless ice on a formless plain
that was and is and comes again
