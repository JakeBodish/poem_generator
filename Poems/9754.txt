
Velvet fruit exquisite square
I hold up to sniff
between finger and thumb -
how you numb me
with your rich attentions
If I dont eat you quickly
youll melt in my palm 
Pleasure seeker if i let you
youd liquefy everywhere 
Knotted smoke dark punch
of earth and night and leaf
for a taste of you
any woman would gladly
crumble to ruin 
Enough chatter I am ready
to fall in love
