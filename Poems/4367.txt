
It is eighty degrees in December 
It is he on one of his furloughs
bringing himself   and hell   up to date My Don Juan the better climber
as the mercury yo-yosis in a newly roused state
the world circumcised away
from an out-of-season bud
leaving at the scrupulous rimas it unfurls a darker appliqué
like O-positive frozen solidat the sight of one’s resuscitated victim 
This rosebush assiduously forks over
its works where most grandifloras falter
thriving as far into the year as Capricorn While named after a lover
it decorates its own altarand wields an extraordinary thorn
once I saw it catch a football
in those semiquaver quasi-teeth
it is three-headed like Cerberusa hybrid drawing bloodlines from a root-ball
on hands all that’s impure lies beneath Hands can train it barbarous
as it is on an arbor and I might like
to take its thick canes in harness
first pouring cement as a baseso it would know I meant business 
Always poised to strikethey eventually undo their stays
baying out like a window
of garnet as at Chartres
torture chamber in its basementor so I hear  I wonder how
such a daemon rose got its startwhat fairy tale explains its scent           
And then I go out tonight
and find him swiping right
on every pretty face in candlelight It is almost Christmas  Stacks
of square plates  It’s an open plan  Racksof bottles  The whites and blacks
clear glass and stainless steel sieves
denote compliance with standards 
A wire basket of freckled pearsis transparency sterilized knives
give full disclosure and as regardsthe stemware due diligence dares
a slip especially on chanteuses like these
salting down from state-of-the-art speakers 
Or is it sugar Does the chorizo flambénot deter him Gold as all hell Valkyries
stand tall with beer to the brim  Beakersin Siren form flush with Chianti if not ambi-
valence  Recalling the steel meshes
belting Monterosso’s
cliffs against the voxDei of the sea the myth refleshes
ordering in the manner of heroesan Andromeda on the rocks
