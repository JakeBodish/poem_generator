
Creator Spirit by whose aidThe worlds foundations first were laidCome visit evry pious mindCome pour thy joys on human kindFrom sin and sorrow set us freeAnd make thy temples worthy Thee 
     O Source of uncreated LightThe Fathers promisd ParacleteThrice Holy Fount thrice Holy FireOur hearts with heavnly love inspireCome and thy Sacred Unction bringTo sanctify us while we sing
     Plenteous of grace descend from highRich in thy sevn-fold energyThou strength of his Almighty HandWhose powr does heavn and earth commandProceeding Spirit our DefenceWho dost the gift of tongues dispenceAnd crownst thy gift with eloquence
     Refine and purge our earthly partsBut oh inflame and fire our heartsOur frailties help our vice controlSubmit the senses to the soulAnd when rebellious they are grownThen lay thy hand and hold em down 
     Chase from our minds th Infernal FoeAnd peace the fruit of love bestowAnd lest our feet should step astrayProtect and guide us in the way 
     Make us Eternal Truths receiveAnd practise all that we believeGive us thy self that we may seeThe Father and the Son by thee 
     Immortal honour endless fameAttend th Almighty Fathers nameThe Saviour Son be glorifiedWho for lost Mans redemption diedAnd equal adoration beEternal Paraclete to thee
