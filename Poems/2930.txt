The city had withdrawn into itselfAnd left at last the country to the countryWhen between whirls of snow not come to lieAnd whirls of foliage not yet laid there droveA stranger to our yard who looked the cityYet did in country fashion in that thereHe sat and waited till he drew us outA-buttoning coats to ask him who he was He proved to be the city come againTo look for something it had left behindAnd could not do without and keep its Christmas He asked if I would sell my Christmas treesMy woods the young fir balsams like a placeWhere houses all are churches and have spires I hadn’t thought of them as Christmas Trees I doubt if I was tempted for a momentTo sell them off their feet to go in carsAnd leave the slope behind the house all bareWhere the sun shines now no warmer than the moon I’d hate to have them know it if I was Yet more I’d hate to hold my trees exceptAs others hold theirs or refuse for themBeyond the time of profitable growthThe trial by market everything must come to I dallied so much with the thought of selling Then whether from mistaken courtesyAnd fear of seeming short of speech or whetherFrom hope of hearing good of what was mine I said“There aren’t enough to be worth while ”“I could soon tell how many they would cutYou let me look them over ”                                                     “You could look But don’t expect I’m going to let you have them ”Pasture they spring in some in clumps too closeThat lop each other of boughs but not a fewQuite solitary and having equal boughsAll round and round  The latter he nodded “Yes” toOr paused to say beneath some lovelier oneWith a buyer’s moderation “That would do ”I thought so too but wasn’t there to say so We climbed the pasture on the south crossed overAnd came down on the north  He said “A thousand ”“A thousand Christmas trees at what apiece”He felt some need of softening that to me“A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars ”Then I was certain I had never meantTo let him have them  Never show surpriseBut thirty dollars seemed so small besideThe extent of pasture I should strip three centsFor that was all they figured out apieceThree cents so small beside the dollar friendsI should be writing to within the hourWould pay in cities for good trees like thoseRegular vestry-trees whole Sunday SchoolsCould hang enough on to pick off enough A thousand Christmas trees I didn’t know I hadWorth three cents more to give away than sellAs may be shown by a simple calculation Too bad I couldn’t lay one in a letter I can’t help wishing I could send you oneIn wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas
