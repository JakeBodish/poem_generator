on her yellow legal pad with a Waterman pen a microcamera 
Although Ive asked why we have to do this I forgot the answer 
The answer to why is because inscrutable outside of logic
helpless useless because  Wing chairs a deco lamp my mothers
cherry dining table nothing we both loved using looks tragic 
Most nights now I sit in the den reading the colorful spines
of your art books Fra Angelico to Zurburan volume after volume
of Balthus Botticelli Cezanne Degas Michelangelo Monet
Titian Velasquez  Friends  An art schools asked for them 
after all they have no real value now except to me    
Upstairs Cerise is that her name gasps at the bentwood chaise
the blonde moderne bedroom set my parents bought
on their two-day Depression honeymoon in Manhattan 
I know this has something to do with paying taxes 
Last night a real icy February zero I went out to start
the engine of the car you gave me on my birthday
to keep it going then came in and forgot it till this morning 
I woke to the citys recycling truck grinding my papers
and plastic bottles and my motor running  And still I wasnt out
of gas Our neighbor his head in a red bandana yelled
We didnt want to bother you at one in the morning
and I thought How did you know I wasnt in there suiciding
Cerise means cherry Clarice means light or famous 
is her name Clarissa What is she saying Shes blurring
she looks like a Candice she looks nice enough but
Ill defer judgement until shes finished this business 
If I let on I felt sad remember my mothers advice
Everyone should collect something That was her path
to the purpose-driven life along rows of a flea market
then alone in her house jammed with the nicked the chipped
ceramics with dings the inscribed wedding bands of strangers 
damaged things that always needed gluing or polishing 
I tried not to teach our children the worlds a dangerous place
but there we were four of us plunked into history listening to Dylan 
Then two of us  Our son and daughter out in it unafraid purposeful    
Somehow life veered from the script  I should get a new cell
phone but eighteen of your messages are inon my old one
and cant be transferred  How can Verizon say your voice isnt
really in there at all calling home to me Then where is it
Why should it disappear from somewhere is unapparently isnt
Why should my living here be so metaphysical
Callista enters our bedroom the room sacrosanct to me
off-limits but no matter  She scans our night tables our TV
our pills and lotions and clippers  Oh morning here
youd perform what youd call your ablutions while
I read the paper in bed  Pearl slinks from her place on my pillow
Bogeys hunched in the clothes closer on your shearling slippers
Hosni Mubaraks been deposed Benghazis a riot of freedom
until the Khadaffis say it isnt  The day you died  I knew
what people meant by saying the earth stopped spinning
on its axis  No choice but to write myself to keep going 
Todays Science Times says were not in the Garden of Eden anymore 
well that shouldnt give evolutionary biologists pause  Life
says the geologists is a natural consequence of geology 
Geology I know theres got to be more to be written 
Clarissa Clarinda Career whatever your name is
pack up your digital camera your officious watery pen
your scrutineers notepad youre in the wrong biosphere
your data will never add up Clarity I think were done here
