
we arent differentiable with bangs and hooded lids 
I know the likeness doesnt stop right there 
whats so great about being horny the joke is insatiable 
it rips and roars between and through  
we both have found our mothers jewels 
buried in closets rolled in silk thread and bunting  
done in scarlet fortunately found never for the men
            in sharing 
these are our secrets  our punch lines and couplets 
I went to bed thinking pixies  the bliss and after-
             math of a spiritual kiss 
how you resonate without rooms maintaining perfect
             valences  
where is the disaster at the end of this dread
in my dream state you were queen a reigning
            bodhisattva without a sprig 
I climbed inside your belly  punched inside you
            laughed and laughed
converting persimmons into a freedom jelly 
Slathered all over I found us exuberant
happy to swing or go both ways
