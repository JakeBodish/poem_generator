One is that some of the girls like cute boys and some
like ugly older men and sometimes women  The differencebetween them is the ones who like older men were felt upby their fathers or uncles or older brothers or if he didnttouch you still you lived in his cauldron of curses andurges which could be just as worse  They grow already oldangry and wise they get rich get mean get theirs The untoucheduncursed others are happy never needing to do much and never do much more than good  They envytheir mean rich talented drunk sisters  Good girls drink milkand make milk and know theyve missed out and know theyrebetter off  They might dance and design but wont rip out lungs for a flag  Bad ones write books and slash red paint on canvas theyve rage to vent theyve fault lines and will rip a toga offa Caesar and stab a goat for the ether  Its as simple as that Either deep in the dark of your history someone showed you that you could be used as a cash machine as a popcorn popper as a rocket launch as a coin-slot jackpot spunker or they didnt and you grew up unused and clueless  Either you got a clueand spiked lunch or you got zilch but no punch  And you never knew  Its exactly not anyones fault  If it happened and you dont like older men thats just because you like them so much you wont let yourself have one  If you dideveryone would see  Then they would know what happened a long time ago with you and with that original him whose eyes youve been avoiding for decades gone forgotten  Thats why you date men smaller than you or not at all  Or maybe youveturned into a man  It isnt anyones fault it is just human and it is what happens  Or doesnt happen  Thats that  Any questions If you see a girl dressed to say No one tells me what to do you know someone once told her what to do
