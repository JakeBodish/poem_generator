
I will not wash my face
   I will not brush my hairI pig around the place  
   Theres nobody to care Nothing but rock and tree
   Nothing but wood and stoneOh God its hell to be
   Alone alone alone Snow-peaks and deep-gashed draws
   Corral me in a ring I feel as if I was
   The only living thingOn all this blighted earth
   And so I frowst and shrinkAnd crouching by my hearth
   I hear the thoughts I think I think of all I miss  
   The boys I used to knowThe girls I used to kiss
   The coin I used to blowThe bars I used to haunt
   The racket and the rowThe beers I didnt want
   I wish I had em now Day after day the same
   Only a little worseNo one to grouch or blame  
   Oh for a loving curseOh in the night I fear
   Haunted by nameless thingsJust for a voice to cheer
   Just for a hand that clingsFaintly as from a star
   Voices come oer the lineVoices of ghosts afar
   Not in this world of mine Lives in whose loom I grope
   Words in whose weft I hearEager the thrill of hope
   Awful the chill of fear Im thinking out aloud
   I reckon that is badThe snow is like a shroud  
   Maybe Im going mad Say wouldnt that be tough
   This awful hush that hugsAnd chokes one is enough
   To make a man go bugs Theres not a thing to do
   I cannot sleep at nightNo wonder Im so blue
   Oh for a friendly fightThe din and rush of strife
   A music-hall aglowA crowd a city life  
   Dear God I miss it soHere you have moped enough
   Brace up and play the gameBut say its awful tough  
   Day after day the sameIve said that twice I bet 
   Well theres not much to say I wish I had a pet
   Or something I could play Cheer up dont get so glum
   And sick of everythingThe worst is yet to come
   God help you till the Spring God shield you from the Fear
   Teach you to laugh not moan Ha ha it sounds so queer  
   Alone alone alone
