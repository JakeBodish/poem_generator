“I will enjoy the echo of their celebrating  And besides the giant snake-head of the bottle bank is at least a block away  I am helping them ”
“And does that offer you a pleasure in these days of random mass shootings in bars and music venues”
“Any bottle that has drops of wine in it and no drops of blood pleases me ”

“I am not your friend good Sir although I wish you well  And I’ll need at least a year to answer your question ”
“Fine then tell me do you differentiate between green brown and colorless bottles”
“No more than the skin colors or hair colors of our citizens ”
“Can I help you for no recompense to bring the bottles to the big metal snake
“Ah kind sir I thank you but some journeys are better taken alone
