My ear amps whistle like they are singing
to Echo goddess of noise
the raveled knot of tongues
of blaring birds consonant crumbs
of dull doorbells sounds swamped
in my misty hearing aid tubes 
Gaudí believed in holy sound
and built a cathedral to contain it
pulling hearing men from their knees
as though atheism is a kind of deafness 
Who would turn down God
Even though I have not heard
the golden decibels of angels
I have been living in a noiseless
palace where the doorbell is pulsating
light and I am able to answer 
                                      2What
a word that keeps looking
in mirrors like it is in love
with its own volume What
I am a one-word question
a one-man
patience test What
What language
would we speak
without earsWhat
Is paradise
a world where
I hear everythingWhat
How will my brain
know what to hold
if it has too many arms
                                      3
The day I clear out my dead father’s flat
I throw away boxes of molding LPs Garvey
Malcolm X Mandela speeches on vinyl 
I find a TDK cassette tape on the shelf
smudged green label Raymond Speaking 
I play the tape in his vintage cassette player
and hear my two-year-old voice chanting my name Antrob
and dad’s laughter crackling in the background
not knowing I couldn’t hear the word “bus”
and wouldn’t until I got my hearing aids 
Now I sit here listening to the space of deafness   Antrob Antrob Antrob

And no one knew what I was missing
until a doctor gave me a handful of Legos
and said to put a brick on the table
every time I heard a sound 
After the test I still held enough bricks
in my hand to build a house
and call it my sanctuary
call it the reason I sat in saintly silence
during my grandfather’s sermons when he preached
the good news I only heard
as Babylon’s babbling echoes 
                                      5
          And if you don’t catch nothing
          then something wrong with your ears
