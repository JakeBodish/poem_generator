
I 
She thinks the monkeys bad luck because
of all the Institutions its seen 
A curious curious George hooked to my hoodie
with arguably racialized inappropriate lips
curling out to smile and greet the staff
as I ask for the nth time why no release
or where is Albeheary By now
anything may well prove to be true
which of course is insane 
II 
Sometimes I lose it  If I cant wear it
When Im on the outside the backpack
Or higgly pocket  Little higgly pigglies
Tearing at the tongue  Speak to me 
Who art Thinning  More vodka 
This time Lakeshore third floor
My DTs I cant dial  The kindest black
Transguy who did my dialing for me 
Others tore their hair out or hanged themselves 
My roomie he collapsed his lung
Eleven times  This is his last trip to the place 
Eventual  Even  They moved me I got the same roommate
Last New Years as the one before 
The shakes are permanent 
The stain all the more so like nothing 
Inside a perpetual processing  This is prisoning 
Ever emotions measured  wrong with you
This isnt as or like anything  Outside I just want back in 
III 
At one point there was something to it 
As when he found a hernia on me in the tub
And suddenly operation  Herr Doctor 
Then hospital at five years old and a Curious
Curious George story  How he went too 
Or windup Campbells Soup 
Of course he slept there for solace  For comfort 
Night rounds  Book lernt animal instinct 
Aping compassion  Inappropriate lips  The old testament wronged
