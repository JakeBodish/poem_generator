
Light flows our war of mocking words and yetBehold with tears mine eyes are wetI feel a nameless sadness oer me roll Yes yes we know that we can jestWe know we know that we can smileBut theres a something in this breastTo which thy light words bring no restAnd thy gay smiles no anodyne Give me thy hand and hush awhileAnd turn those limpid eyes on mineAnd let me read there love thy inmost soul Alas is even love too weakTo unlock the heart and let it speakAre even lovers powerless to revealTo one another what indeed they feelI knew the mass of men concealdTheir thoughts for fear that if revealdThey would by other men be metWith blank indifference or with blame reprovedI knew they lived and movedTrickd in disguises alien to the restOf men and alien to themselves and yetThe same heart beats in every human breastBut we my love doth a like spell benumbOur hearts our voices must we too be dumbAh well for us if even weEven for a moment can get freeOur heart and have our lips unchaindFor that which seals them hath been deep-ordaindFate which foresawHow frivolous a baby man would be By what distractions he would be possessdHow he would pour himself in every strifeAnd well-nigh change his own identity That it might keep from his capricious playHis genuine self and force him to obeyEven in his own despite his beings lawBade through the deep recesses of our breastThe unregarded river of our lifePursue with indiscernible flow its wayAnd that we should not seeThe buried stream and seem to beEddying at large in blind uncertaintyThough driving on with it eternally But often in the worlds most crowded streetsBut often in the din of strifeThere rises an unspeakable desireAfter the knowledge of our buried lifeA thirst to spend our fire and restless forceIn tracking out our true original courseA longing to inquireInto the mystery of this heart which beatsSo wild so deep in us to knowWhence our lives come and where they go And many a man in his own breast then delvesBut deep enough alas none ever mines And we have been on many thousand linesAnd we have shown on each spirit and powerBut hardly have we for one little hourBeen on our own line have we been ourselves Hardly had skill to utter one of allThe nameless feelings that course through our breastBut they course on for ever unexpressd And long we try in vain to speak and actOur hidden self and what we say and doIs eloquent is well but t is not trueAnd then we will no more be rackdWith inward striving and demandOf all the thousand nothings of the hourTheir stupefying powerAh yes and they benumb us at our callYet still from time to time vague and forlornFrom the souls subterranean depth upborneAs from an infinitely distant landCome airs and floating echoes and conveyA melancholy into all our day Only but this is rare When a belovèd hand is laid in oursWhen jaded with the rush and glareOf the interminable hoursOur eyes can in anothers eyes read clearWhen our world-deafend earIs by the tones of a loved voice caressd A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breastAnd a lost pulse of feeling stirs again The eye sinks inward and the heart lies plainAnd what we mean we say and what we would we know A man becomes aware of his lifes flowAnd hears its winding murmur and he seesThe meadows where it glides the sun the breeze And there arrives a lull in the hot raceWherein he doth for ever chaseThat flying and elusive shadow rest An air of coolness plays upon his faceAnd an unwonted calm pervades his breast And then he thinks he knowsThe hills where his life roseAnd the sea where it goes
