
Thrice toss these oaken ashes in the airThrice sit thou mute in this enchanted chairThen thrice three times tie up this true loves knotAnd murmur soft She will or she will not 
 Go burn these poisnous weeds in yon blue fireThese screech-owls feathers and this prickling briarThis cypress gathered at a dead mans graveThat all my fears and cares an end may have 
 Then come you fairies dance with me a roundMelt her hard heart with your melodious sound In vain are all the charms I can deviseShe hath an art to break them with her eyes
