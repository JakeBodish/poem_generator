
It was hard to sit there with my father
watching one of my sisters girls playing
a set of tennis against my son or daughter
because hed forget himself and with a groan
of disappointment or a grunt
of sympathetic exertion make it clear
that he was rooting for my sisters child
and against mine  There was no use
calling him on it because hed deny it
and get angry  So I would get angry
but try not to show it until I couldnt
stand it any longer and would get up
and walk away  That was how it worked
between us the unspoken building up
like thunderheads above the tennis court
where the kids played on not caring who won
and hardly noticing the sky had darkened
