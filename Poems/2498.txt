Cast away regret and rueThink what you are marching to Little live great pass Jesus Christ and BarabbasWere found the same day This died that went his way So sing with joyful breathFor why you are going to death Teeming earth will surely storeAll the gladness that you pour 
Earth that never doubts nor fearsEarth that knows of death not tearsEarth that bore with joyful easeHemlock for SocratesEarth that blossomed and was glad‘Neath the cross that Christ hadShall rejoice and blossom tooWhen the bullet reaches you Wherefore men marchingOn the road to death singPour your gladness on earths headSo be merry so be dead 
From the hills and valleys earthShouts back the sound of mirthTramp of feet and lilt of songRinging all the road along All the music of their goingRinging swinging glad song-throwingEarth will echo still when footLies numb and voice mute On marching men onTo the gates of death with song Sow your gladness for earths reapingSo you may be glad though sleeping Strew your gladness on earths bedSo be merry so be dead
