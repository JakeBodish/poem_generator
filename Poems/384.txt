
To imagine a morning
 
the first
sounds from the street
 
and the house its halls
 
scarifying
consciousness
 
Antique glass
smudges limbs
 
more blue
than green
 
flared out
over a roof
 
To imagine
the raw circumference
 
of a field
as it wakes
 
what we make of it
 
where our senses
send us
 
 
Gray oscillates gray
and the mountain
 
a line
lodged within it
 
gone slack at the end
 
 
No need
to mention
weather
 
The yard 
the measure
 
An unkempt
garden bed
convulses
 
synchronous
with traffic
 
flashing through
the fence
 
 
Stone bench
in a ring of weeds
 
Shadows ring 
a sound
 
Bees doused in
viscous sun
erased
