
When my aunt died
my uncle raised his hands
like a prophet in the Bible 
“Ive lost my girl” he said
“Ive lost my girl” over and over
shaking his head 
I didnt know what to say
where to look
my quiet uncle raising his voice
to silence 
My aunt was eighty-seven 
“Listen” my uncle said sighing
like a tree alone at night
“women know 
Every midnight on New Years Eve
when others sang
and laughed and hugged
your aunt looked at me
tears in her eyes 
Sixty years 
She knew 
One day wed kiss good-bye ”
