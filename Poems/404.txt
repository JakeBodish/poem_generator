
I am so done with feeling
Xmas Amaryllis grow
in places where thralls go free
I am not quite enough
for the woodland promoting myself again
after all accused men have been named
In Casablanca I wait for livestock
to come through luxe doors
for thighs to grow less through absorption
My killer is not going to be invited to this
Ornamenting party and I am blue daisies
casting O’s wide in anointment
Now that he’s gone I am free to torch down the
Valley                        la spiaggia of pure
Purple                         small neck in hand
