I listened to them talking talkingThat tableful of keen and clever folkSputtering       followed by a pale and balkingSort of flash whenever some one spokeLike musty fireworks or a pointless jokeFollowed by a pointless musty laughter  ThenWithout a pause the sputtering once again      The air was thick with epigrams and smokeAnd underneath it allIt seemed that furtive things began to crawlHissing and striking in the darkAiming at no particular markAnd careless whom they hurt The petty jealousies the smiling hatesShot forth their venom as they passed the platesAnd hissed and struck again aroused alertUsing their feeble smartness as a screenTo shield their poisonous stabbing to divertFrom what was cowardly and black and mean Then I thought of youYour gentle soul Your large and quiet kindnessReady to caution and consoleAnd with an almost blindnessTo what was mean and low Baseness you never knewYou could not think that falsehood was untrueNor that deceit would ever dare betray you You even trusted treachery and soGuileless what guile or evil could dismay youYou were for counsels rather than commands Your sweetness was your strength your strength a sweetnessThat drew all men and made reluctant handsRest long upon your shoulder Firm but never proudYou walked your sixty years as through a crowdOf friends who loved to feel your warmth and whoKnowing that warmth knew you Even the casual beholderCould see your fresh and generous completenessLike dawn in a deep forest growing and shining through Such faith has soothed and armed you  It has smiledFrankly and unashamed at Death and like a childSwayed half by joy and half by reticenceWalking beside its nurse you walk with LifeProtected by your smile and an immenseSecurity and simple confidence Hearing the talkers talk I thought of you      And it was like a great wind blowingOver confused and poisonous places It was like sterile spacesCrowded with birds and grasses soaked clear throughWith sunlight quiet and vast and clean And it was forests growingAnd it was black things turning green And it was laughter on a thousand faces      It was like victory rising from defeatThe world made well again and strong and sweet
