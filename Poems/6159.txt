
              B D  was a decent
poet but difficult
to define or for himself to self-divine
a follower a “gift” the way one seeker
loose but selective
identified himself
to an intoxication
reading obnubilating poems
in a brick-and-river town
a generous ecstatic overnight 
A present or an absence
needing to be present who tailed me
who mailed women years ago when he
was free with his attention
a fixation that he felt attended him 
               Sometimes several times a week
then several times a day
he’d write me for he was free
to borrow books go to the mailbox
at 3 a m  for it was urgent that he send
a bride issue of Vogue Bazaar
not Seventeen but Glamour but not Ms 
from the Heartland where
Don’t forget our wedding date
he bubble wrapped some trinkets snapshots   
poses of his parakeet beside his own long head
               meeting at an angle in a steely mirror 
His wife from her wheelchair
had made their camera flash He tried to kill his wife
with a little hammer
