
Whats the bird ratio overhead
Zero zero  Maybe its El Niño
The storm was it bad
Here the worst ever  Every tree hurt 
Do you love trees
Only the gingko the fir the birch 
Yours Do you name your trees
Who owns the trees Whos talking
You presume a dialogue  Me and You 
Yes  Your fingers tap  Im listening 
Will you answer Why mention trees
When the weather turned rain into ice the leaves failed 
So what Every year leaves fail  The cycle  Birth to death 
In the night the sound of cannon and death everywhere 
What did you see
Next morning roots against the glass 
Whos talking now and in familiar language Get real 
Whats real is the broken crown  The trunk shattered 
Was that storm worse than others
Yes and no  The winds torque twisted open the trees tibia 
Fool  Youre talking about vegetables  Do you love the patio
   tomato The Christmas cactus
Yes  And the magnolia on the roof the felled crabapple the topless
   spruce
