
                                                   Wuxi China
Walking out of the new cemetery my father
takes my hand having just re-interred the remains
of his own father and his fathers two wives 
his mother dead from T B  by the time he was ten 
He takes my hand and says Now I can die in peace
even if we didn’t get the actual bones
