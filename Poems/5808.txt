
Give me the night you beasts hissing over the face of this dead
woman I climb into your eyes looking  To those who would sleep
through the wounds they inflict on others I offer pain to help them
awaken Ju-Ju Tom-Toms  the magic of a talking burning bush 
I am the queen of sleight of hand wandering the forest of motives
armed with horoscopes cosmic encounters  an X-Acto knife  My
right eye is a projector flickering Hottentot  Huey Newton my
left eye is prism of Wild Style gold grills lowriders black dahlias
blunts  back alleys  At twenty-one I stood at the crossroad of Hell
 Here evil peering at me behind a blue-red eye  I armed myself
with the memories of Pentecostal tent revivals apple orchards the
strawberry fields I roamed with my mother  aunts in the summer 
 the sightings of UFO lights blinking in the black of an Ohio
nightsky  I am a weapon  I believe in hoodoo voodoo root workers Dead Presidents Black Tail Black Inches  Banjees  I believe in the
ghosts of 60 million or more  black bones disintegrating at the
bottom of the Atlantic below sea level Not Just Knee Deep  I believe
that children are the future love them now or meet them at dusk
at your doorstep a 9mm in their right hand  a head noisy as a
hornet’s nest later  Your choice 
Black still in the hour of chaos I believe in Royal Crown Afro-Sheen 
Vaseline Jergens  baby powder on breasts the collective conscious
cellular memory Public Enemies outlaws Outkast elevations

with a Boxer named Mister after traumatically stumbling on strange
fruit dangling from one of the most beautiful Sycamores evah  Under
my knife Marilyn Monroe enjoys an evening out with Ella Fitzgerald
meanwhile Life shows me a gigantic photo  I am a weapon  I chart
voyages of unlove high on a man called crazy who turns nigger into
prince  I believe in Jong Clifton “Dirty Diana”  Dilla paper scrilla
green gumbo coins Batty Bois  Video Vixens  I believe that beads
at the ends of braids are percussive instruments in double Dutch  
In the reflection of my knife Cab Calloway Duke Ellington

 African Hebrew Israelites  I believe in Octoroons Quadroons
Culluds Cooley High Commodores Krumpin Krunk  BurnHollywood Burn 
I am Sethe crawling a field toward freedom with a whitegirl talking
about velvet  I believe in tumbleweaves hot combs  hair lyes Chaka
Khan Shaka Zulu Mau Mau Slum Village  Buhloone Mindstate
“Empty your mind be formless shapeless  Like water ” I believe
in water  My body is pulp  I bleed ink  I believe in the Fantastic Vol 
2 The Low End Theory Space Is the Place  The Hissing of Summer
Lawns  Tucked in the corner of my right ventricle sprouts a Tree of
Knowledge lives a Shining Serpent  a middle finger  I’m on a quest
for the Marvelous  My face is a mask of malehood malevolence one
big masquerade  Metaphysically niggerish I am a weapon wandering
the forest of motives a machete in one hand a mirror in the other
searching for the nearest body of water
