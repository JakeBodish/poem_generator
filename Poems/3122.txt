Pretend stars 
Im sick of explanations  A life is like Russell said
of electricity not a thing but the way things behave 
A science of motion toward some flat surface
some heat some cold  Some light
can leave some after-image but it doesnt last 
Isnt that what they say That and that
historical events exchange glances with nothingness
