Whereas his wrist loose at the bottleneck to come across as candid “Well at least there was an Apology that’s all I can say” he offers to the circle each of them scholarly
Whereas under starlight the fireflies wink across East Coast grass and me I sit there painful in my silence glued to a bench in the midst of the American casual
Whereas a subtle electricity in that low purple light I felt their eyes on my face gauging a reaction and someone’s discomfort leaks out in a well-stated “Hmmm”
Whereas like a bird darting from an oncoming semi my mind races to the Apology’s assertion “While the establishment of permanent European settlements in North America did stir conflict with nearby Indian tribes peaceful and mutually beneficial interactions also took place”
Whereas I cross my arms and raise a curled hand to my mouth as if thinking as if  taking it in I allow a static quiet then choose to stand up excusing myself  I leave them to unease
Whereas I drive down the road replaying the get-together how the man and his beer bottle stated their piece and I reel at what I could have said or done better
Whereas I could’ve but didn’t broach the subject of “genocide” the absence of this term from the Apology and its rephrasing as “conflict” for example
Whereas since the moment had passed I accept what’s done and the knife of my conscience pierces with bone-clean self-honesty
Whereas in a stirred conflict between settlers and an Indian that night in a circle
Whereas I struggle to confess that I didn’t want to explain anything
Whereas truthfully I wished most to kick the legs of that man’s chair out from under him
Whereas to watch him fall backward legs flailing beer stench across his chest
Whereas I pictured it happening in cinematic slow-motion delightful
Whereas the curled hand I raised to my mouth was a sign of indecision
Whereas I could’ve done it but I didn’t
Whereas I can admit this also took place yes at least
 

WHEREAS we ride to the airport in a van they swivel their necks and shoulders around to speak to me sugar and lilt in their voices something like nurses their nursely kindness through my hair then engage me as comrades in a fight together  Well what we want to know one lady asks is why they don’t have schools there Her outrage empathy her furrowed brow  There are schools there I reply  Grade schools high schools colleges  But why aren’t there any stores there There are stores there  Grocery stores convenience stores trading posts whatever what-have-you I explain but it’s here I recognize the break  It’s here we roll along the pavement into hills of conversation we share a ride we share a country but live in alternate nations and here I must tell them what they don’t know or should I Should I is the moment to seize and before I know it I say Well you know Native people as in tribes as in “people” living over there are people with their own nations each with its own government and flag they rise to their own national songs and sing in their own languages even  And by there I mean here all around us I remind them  Drifting in side-glances to whirring trees through the van windows then back to me they dig in they unearth the golden question My God how come we were never taught this in our schools The concern and furrow  But God the slowing wheels and we lurch forward in the van’s downshift and brake  Together we reach a full-stop  Trapped in a helix of traffic we’re late for check-in security flights our shoulders flex forward into panicked outward gazes nerves and fingers cradle our wristwatches so to answer their question now would be untimely because to really speak to it ever is untimely  But there Comrades there there Nurses  I will remember the swing of your gold earrings  There your perfume around me as a fresh blanket  There you checked my pulse kindly  There the boundary of bedside manners
 

WHEREAS a woman I know says she watched a news program a reporter detailed the fire a house in which five children burned perhaps their father too she doesn’t recall exactly but remembers the camera on the mother’s face the mother’s blubbering her hiccuping and wail she leans to me she says she never knew then in those times that year this country the northern state she grew up in she was so young you see she’d never seen it before nobody talked about them she means Indians she tells me and so on and so on but that moment in front of the TV she says was like opening a box left at her door opening to see the thing inside whereas to say she learned through that mother’s face can you believe it and I let her finish wanting someone to say it but she hated saying it or so she said admitting how she never knew until then they could feel
 

WHEREAS the word whereas means it being the case that or considering that or while on the contrary is a qualifying or introductory statement a conjunction a connector  Whereas sets the table  The cloth  The saltshakers and plates  Whereas calls me to the table because Whereas precedes and invites  I have come now  I’m seated across from a Whereas smile  Under pressure of formalities I fidget I shake my legs  I’m not one for these smiles Whereas I have spent my life in unholding  What do you mean by unholding Whereas asks and since Whereas rarely asks I am moved to respond Whereas I have learned to exist and exist without your formality saltshakers plates cloth  Without the slightest conjunctions to connect me  Without an exchange of questions without the courtesy of answers  This has become mine this unholding  Whereas with or without the setup I can see the dish being served  Whereas let us bow our heads in prayer now just enough to eat
