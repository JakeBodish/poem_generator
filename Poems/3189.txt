
Last summer I found a small box stashed away in my apartment
a box  filled with enough Vicodin to kill me   I would  have sworn
that  Id  thrown it away years earlier  but apparently not  I stared
at the white pills blankly for a long while I even took a picture of
them  before  finally definitely  throwing  them away   Id been
sober  again  for  some years  when  I found that box  but every
addict  has  one  a  little  box  metaphorical  or  actual  hidden
away   Before I flushed them  I held them in my palm  marveling
that  at  some  point in  the  not-so-distant  past it seemed a good
idea  to  keep a  stash of  pills on hand   For an emergency I told
myself   What kind of emergency What  if  I needed  a root canal
on  a  Sunday  night  This little  box  would  see me through until
the   dentist   showed   up  for   work  the  next  morning   Half  my
brain  told  me  that  while  the other half  knew that  looking into
that  box  was  akin  to  seeing  a photograph of myself standing on
the  edge of a bridge  a bridge  in the  familiar  dark neighborhood
of  my  mind   that   comfortable  place   where  I  could  somehow
believe that fuck it was an adequate response to life
