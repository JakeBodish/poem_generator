We went to all those places where they restore sadness and joyand call it art  We were piloted by Auden who becameUnbearably acrimonious when we dropped off Senghor into thesteamy skies of his beloved West Africa  The termites and antswere waiting for him to unearth the sun in Elissa  The cloudswere as cool as a dog’s nose pressed against our cheeks  Inotice your eggshell skin is as creamy as a lion’s armpit as wecross the horizon on strands of Yeats’ silver hair  There is alight coffee flame in his eyes guiding us like an old Irish housecleaner holding a candle in a black and white English movie Yeats’ lips look like an angry Rimbaud illuminating poetry withhis youth and vigorous sunlight  He knew eternity would vanishthe sun at dusk  He caught it with a rainbow tied to his finger There was nothing left after that  We cross the equatorheading north following Emily Dickinson’s black bag containingstems of her longer poems preserved in darkness and memorylike wild pearls thrown overboard to avoid capture by Spanishpirates  The islands below float by like water hearts in a child’saquarium  We are candy wrappers being blown across thewaxed floors of poetry  We land on the Brooklyn Bridge Whitman’s past-port face is grinning at the nineteenth centuryin the thorny arms of Gerard Manley Hopkins whose head wasset on fire by God’s little hands  The hands that circumcisedthe world  Gertrude Stein is a match flaring on a youngwoman’s pillow whose birthmarks have been stolen  We crossthe green Atlantic into World War One  We are met by Rilkedressed in his Orpheus uniform wearing white sonnet glovesthat once belonged to a stone angel  Rilke offers us a glass ofamontillado made from Lorca’s private stock of gypsy tears The sherry is not quite as dry as Wallace Stevens’ lush mangometaphors of familiar objects  Although Stevens’ poems arefragrant there is a lingering afterthought of Pound on thetongue  Pound collected his misty feelings to make raindropsinto European and American poetry  Vagueness became assharp as a pencil  Our blue box is not allowed to attendApollinaire’s birthday party held by the august Académiefrançaise
