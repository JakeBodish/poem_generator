
When you wake up after twelve hours The stove is cold theres ice in the water bucket   clouds outside and snow the noise of a crow The only sound until your wife cries From an upper bunk Honey Id like some coffee  Luther chuckles  I nod excuse myself  for the mens room Next to me stretches a teacher Who once warned me not to get married Too early  Elderly now but having done well In real estate as a second career  He says Well well as if  he cant recall my name  But buys me a drink and talks of  his wayward Daughter  When he mentions her married last name I tell him I have met her but leave off at that          He squints like a badger  In my wifes family he resumes After a jostling by a drunken salesman theres a Sort of stupid gene that runs through the whole outfit Being half  Finnish half  Dutch   or maybe something Cancelled something             I notice a protuberance a small growth At the edge of  his eye hanging like a broken thread I always thought I say your daughter had a charming Personality  He hunches his shoulders  Waking to dread The debts of  dread   but I couldnt help him  Neither did I want to  On the way out I spot my first wife chatting with a small-time gangster   She flutters a wave my way a Victorian flutter
