
There be none of Beautys daughters
    With a magic like theeAnd like music on the waters
    Is thy sweet voice to meWhen as if its sound were causingThe charmed oceans pausingThe waves lie still and gleamingAnd the lulld winds seem dreaming
 And the midnight moon is weaving
    Her bright chain oer the deepWhose breast is gently heaving
    As an infants asleepSo the spirit bows before theeTo listen and adore theeWith a full but soft emotionLike the swell of Summers ocean
