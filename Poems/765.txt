
Abandoned house roofless three walls
no floor a ruin if you think house 
 
to brown towhees a place to scratch
in the leaves for bugs and worms
 
for the male to sing a territorial song
from what remains of the chimney 
 
an imagination problem like the time
friends said we must be very happy
 
in the beautiful house we built because
they couldnt see the ruins inside us
