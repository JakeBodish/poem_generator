
In the muddy maze of some old neighborhoodOften where the street lamp gleams like bloodAs the wind whips the flame rattles the glassWhere human beings ferment in a stormy massOne sees a ragpicker knocking against the wallsPaying no heed to the spies of the cops his thrallsBut stumbling like a poet lost in dreamsHe pours his heart out in stupendous schemes He takes great oaths and dictates sublime lawsCasts down the wicked aids the victims causeBeneath the sky like a vast canopyHe is drunken of his splendid qualities Yes these people plagued by household caresBruised by hard work tormented by their yearsEach bent double by the junk he carriesThe jumbled vomit of enormous Paris They come back perfumed with the smell of staleWine-barrels followed by old comrades paleFrom war mustaches like limp flags to marchWith banners flowers through the triumphal archErected for them by some magic touchAnd in the dazzling deafening debauchOf bugles sunlight of huzzas and drumBring glory to the love-drunk folks at homeEven so wine pours its gold to frivolousHumanity a shining PactolusThen through mans throat of high exploits it singsAnd by its gifts reigns like authentic kings To lull these wretches sloth and drown the hateOf all who mutely die compassionateGod has created sleeps oblivionMan added Wine divine child of the Sun
