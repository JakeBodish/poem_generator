
I was hanging with grandparents in a kindergarten
and the teacher drew an accordion wall across
to keep the children in antigravity class together
the grandparents separately graded balloon worksheets
sunlight floated in the grandparents thoughtful about addition mulling vacationCome here I said to the little one too little to be in class soft as peachesI want to tell you something and you repeat it back to me next time
She toddled over put her arms up to hug me we hugged
She had stars inside her soul was visibly celestial beneath her coatMore human than human got it I cuddled herOkay she said I’m more human than a human
