
Heres how we were counted
firstborn nay-sayers
veterans slow-payers
seditionists convicts
half-breeds has-beens
the nearly defined dead
all the disenfranchised live 
Once everybody had a place
among the nameless  Now we
cant afford to be anonymous 
Consider they said the poor
the misfit consider the woman
figuring herself per cent 
Consider the P A  system making
a point so intimate I petition
not to be anybodys good guess
or estimate  I ask to be one
maybe widow-to-be watching the sun
diminish brick by brick along the jail
wall and also that green pear
on its drunken roll out
of the executioners lunch basket 
At 1201 02 in the cocked chamber
of the digital clock
the newsman said Therell be less
work in the new century
