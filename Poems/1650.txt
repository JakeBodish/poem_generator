
I tied it to your wristWith a pretty pink bow torn offBy the first little tug of wind I’m sorry I jumped to catch it but not soon enough It darted away It still looked large and almost within reach Like a heart Watch I said You squinted your little eyes The balloon looked happy wavingGood-bye The sky is very high today I said Red went black a polka dotThen not  We watched itEven though we couldn’tSpot it anymore at all Even after that
