
Wandering slowly back after dark one night
above a river toward a suspension bridge
a sound concerns him that might be a tune
or might not noise drifting in trailing off 
 
Then concerns him again now clearly a song
pulsing out from the opposite bank being sung
by chorusing men all pewter-haired or bald
in the function suite of a shabby hotel 
Above their heads a conductor’s hand
draws and casts the notes with a white wand 
 
Songs about mills and mines and a great war
about mermaid brides and solid gold hills
songs from broken hymnbooks and cheesy films 
 
Then his father’s voice rising out of that choir
and his father’s father’s voice and voices
of fathers before concerning him only
arcing through charged air and spanning the gorge 
He steps over the cliff edge and walks across
