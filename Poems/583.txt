
Near the camp was a river
and in our house were absentees and hands
that will one day wake us in vain
 
I had just turned seven
while he was sitting in the shade
ironing his clothes
the blue jacket sagging over his shoulders
 
I paid no attention to the road
or the three steps
and didnt notice the carpet
 
I dont remember who was it that said
to me or to another
When you grow up poetry will become your house
 
The dust that eats the memories
always distances those folks
 
yet their chairs appear from afar
from behind the hills and over the houses
to hang in an air of summer and holm oak
those shaded chairs that reach the heart
on shoulders topped
with five flowers
 
Which flowers are speech
which flowers are silence
 
And I cant remember
whether it was my uncle who stood at the door
whether we had palm and lotus trees
in our house in Karameh
 
whether my mother
who gave birth to me on the shelf
was folding our clothes behind our fathers back
so he could sleep
 
The watchdogs used to cry from the heat
and poetry Husseini of Jerusalem
and Khidr the mystic were all in our house
as was my uncle who came from a pond
within Hebrons walls
 
Twenty years would pass before a photo could tell us
we have grown older
and thats that
 
My father used to discompose his friends
with his days and women
with the thread of seduction in his voice
as he would sprinkle chatter in their rivers
while walking about here or there with a lilt
hed let his days fall off him
and let others gather them as he walked
on gold that came only for him
 
And I cant remember
in our courtyard there were holm oaks
a fountain a tiled floor by a huge door
we were confused and in a hurry
 
The closet that faced us in the second room
had a mirror
the mirror we now seek
 
And my father was standing alone in the hall that led
the stairs to the roof
thanking his days
or preparing for Wednesdays nap
or Thursdays morning
as he left among the things hed leave the water can
full of water
while around his chairs our Saturdays rose
 
My father didnt want too much from life
a house five boys
who dont mess with his papers
which were already chaos
and two girls
so that braids could float all around the house
