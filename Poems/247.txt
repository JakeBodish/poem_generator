
Why what a pettish petty thing I grow–
A mere mere woman–a mere flaccid nerve-
A kerchief left out all night in the rain
Turned soft so–overtasked and overstrained
And overlived in this close London life
And yet I should be stronger 
                          Never burn
Your letters poor Aurora for they stare
With red seals from the table saying each
Heres something that you know not
