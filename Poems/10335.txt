If you can dress to make yourself attractive       Yet not make puffs and curls your chief delightIf you can swim and row be strong and active       But of the gentler graces lose not sightIf you can dance without a craze for dancing       Play without giving play too strong a holdEnjoy the love of friends without romancing       Care for the weak the friendless and the oldIf you can master French and Greek and Latin       And not acquire as well a priggish mienIf you can feel the touch of silk and satin       Without despising calico and jeanIf you can ply a saw and use a hammer       Can do a man’s work when the need occursCan sing when asked without excuse or stammer       Can rise above unfriendly snubs and slursIf you can make good bread as well as fudges       Can sew with skill and have an eye for dustIf you can be a friend and hold no grudges       A girl whom all will love because they mustIf sometime you should meet and love another       And make a home with faith and peace enshrinedAnd you its soul a loyal wife and mother        You’ll work out pretty nearly to my mindThe plan that’s been developed through the ages       And win the best that life can have in storeYou’ll be my girl the model for the sages        A woman whom the world will bow before
