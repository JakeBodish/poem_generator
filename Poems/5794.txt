Amidst the glossy dark green foliageof trees around the hotel poolI spy a low-hanging golden fruit So many trees whose names I do not knowand for the first time do not care to learn The overwhelming now in its countless inflectionscancels vocabulary eyes lips skininstead of words  Still in the poolfloating on my back as the sun gets lowI look at the mango if that is what it isI think it is some wholly other fruitand suddenly smell garlic sautéed in butter Chefs in the kitchen under the treesare getting the hors d’oeuvres ready Yesterday in a dim airless galleryfollowing your leadI hunted down an iconographywritten in a grisly alphabetyet full of life the haunting gaze directtranscending death  Death had in winning lost Art trumped death and life trumped art  Last nightour third together   sleepa whole new texture in a bed with youI gave you space and found myself at the borderof a far province in the king-sized beda dimly lit hinterland where paintings ruleda region wholly devoted to the workof the same painter mysteriously killedstoned to death “lapidated” was one wordassassinated   why A mysteryto be solved by iconographyDeath had won but also death had lost Garlic and butter  Glossy dark green leaves Voices across the pool  A hanging fruit An azure splash  And as the sun goes downyou sit by the window in our roomdrawing pictures of this this this time What to call it Colors in your handstrump words  Like the fruitlike the solution to the mysterysomething I am at a loss to name
