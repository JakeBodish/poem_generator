
i early morning 
The rain gray god with its huge hands
has shredded the roses and clapping
kept us up all night the bridge washed out
the troll waiting to gobble a goat 
How long has he been there wet and coldimpatient starving his coat
rent with welts and matted with mistFather thundering his voice full
of  bracken and leaves leaves that in
the autumn clogged the gutters  Who
goes over the bridge Who goes there
