
Where there’s smoke
there are mirrors
and a dry ice machine
industrial quality fans 
If I’ve learned anything
about the present moment
 
 • 
But who doesn’t
love a flame
the way one leaps
into being
full-fledged
then leans over
to chat
 
• 
Already the light
is retrospective
sourceless
is losing itself
though the trees
are clearly limned
