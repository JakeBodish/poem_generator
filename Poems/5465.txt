
Is this mountain all rock or are there any villages on itThese are some of the things I said to her We bake because it is a way of overcoming In the journey of zest I see myself On the news every day people are standing up screamingor lying down screaming while others remain calm She pointed out that I had not made eye contactwith her at all  Then I cried properly in a short burst This is the worst example of any circumstance evernoted a journalist in his notebook Let butter and chocolate be a wish not to dieI implored the bain-marie  She likened me to a sieve I clutch all my poems to my chest and count themagain and again  I am kneeling like a small dog What’s going on with this modern worldand the right wife not even knowingwhat the left wife is doing Now all you have to dois cut off the legs  After an absence after a hard taskafter the way the hand turns like this  There was so much I couldn’t contain She asked me how I was feeling in my bodyat this moment I said tense in my whole trunk area A strong smell of white wine  She said it came froman impulse that she often used to have when she firststarted practicing  She said she believed feelingsare held in the body  She asked me what was going onwith my breath and I realized I was sort of holding it Like the boxes in the cupboard  “Enough” can get bigger How much bigger though When I sayI’ve had enough how will you know when to stop
