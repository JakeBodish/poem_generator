
See the chariot at hand here of Love
     Wherein my lady ridethEach that draws is a swan or a dove
     And well the car Love guideth As she goes all hearts do duty
          Unto her beautyAnd enamourd do wish so they might
          But enjoy such a sightThat they still were to run by her sideThrough swords through seas whither she would ride Do but look on her eyes they do light
     All that Loves world comprisethDo but look on her hair it is bright
     As Loves star when it risethDo but mark her foreheads smoother
          Than words that soothe herAnd from her arched brows such a grace
          Sheds itself through the faceAs alone there triumphs to the lifeAll the gain all the good of the elements strife Have you seen but a bright lily grow
     Before rude hands have touchd itHa you markd but the fall o the snow
     Before the soil hath smutchd itHa you felt the wool o the beaver
          Or swans down everOr have smelt o the bud o the briar
          Or the nard in the fireOr have tasted the bag of the beeOh so white Oh so soft Oh so sweet is she
