
I live a life of appetite and yes thats right
I live a life of privilege in New York
Eating buttered toast in bed with cunty fingers on Sunday morning 
Say that again
I have a rule 
I never give to beggars in the street who hold their hands out 
 
I woke up this morning in my air-conditioning 
At the end of my legs were my feet 
Foot and foot stretched out outside the duvet looking for me
Get up  Giddyup  Get going 
My feet were there on the far side of my legs 
Get up  Giddyup  Get going 
 
I dont really think I am going to 
Obama is doing just fine 
I dont think Im going to 
Get up  Giddyup  Get going 
I can see out the window it isnt raining 
So much for the endless forecasts always wrong 
 
The poor are poorer than they ever were 
The rich are richer than the poor 
Is it true about the poor
Its always possible to be amusing 
I saw a rat down in the subway 
So what if you saw a rat 
 
I admire the poor profusely 
I want their autograph 
They make me shy 
I keep my distance 
Im getting to the bottom of the island 
Lower Broadway comes to a boil and City Hall is boiling 
 
Im half asleep but Im awake 
At the other end of me are my feet
In shoes of considerable sophistication
Walking down Broadway in the heat 
Im half asleep in the heat 
Im so to speak wearing a hat 
 
Im no Saint Francis 
Im in one of my trances 
When I look in a mirror
Theres an old man in a trance 
Theres a Gobi Desert
And thats poetry or rather rhetoric 
 
You see what happens if you dont make sense
It only makes sense to not 
You feel the flicker of a hummingbird
It takes a second to find 
You hear a whirr 
Its here  Its there  It hovers begging hand out
