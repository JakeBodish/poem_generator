
When I was a troubadour
When I was an astronaut
When I was a pirate
You should have seen my closet
You would have loved my shoes 
Kindly consider my application
Even though your position is filled 
This is my stash of snow globes
This is my favorite whip
This is a picture of me with a macaw
This is a song I almost could sing 
When I was a freight train
When I was a satellite
When I was a campfire
You should have seen the starburst
You should have tasted my tomato 
I feel sorry for you I’m unqualified
This is my finest tube of toothpaste
This is when I rode like the raj on a yak
This is the gasoline this is the match 
When I was Hegel’s dialectic
When I was something Rothko forgot
When I was moonlight paving the street
You should have seen the roiling shore
You should have heard the swarm of bees
