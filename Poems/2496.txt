
Our cabdriver tells us how Somalia is better
than here because in Islam we execute murderers 
So fewer murders  But isnt there civil warthere now Arent there a lot of murders
Yes but in general its better  Not
now but most of the time  He tells us about how
smart the system is how its hard to bear
false witness  We nod  Were learning a lot 
I say once we are close to the house I say Whatabout us Two women married to each other Dont be offended he says gravely  But a manwith a man a woman with a woman it would bea public execution  We nod  A little silence along
the Southeast Corridor  Then I say YeahI love my country  This makes him laugh we all laugh We arent offended says Josey  We love you  Sometimes
I feel like were proselytizing spreading the Word of Gay 
The cab is shaking with laughter the poor man
relieved were not mad he sort of wants us dead 
The two of us soothing him wanting him comfortable
wanting him to laugh  We love our country
we tell him  And Josey tips him  She tips him well
