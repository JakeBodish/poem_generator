
Dying Dad wanted sunscreen  Nonstop  Frantic if withheld  Would sayscreen and we just did it  Knew he was dying  Was angry 
In last weeks wore red sleepmask over eyes day and night  Would
ride it up onto his forehead for brief intervals then down pulled by
hand that still worked  A bit  Sometimes shaking too much so just
cried eyes  Cried now now  Once cried out light   more like a hiss   was
there for that  Yanked it quick  Needed it so badly the bandage the
world is a short place wanted the illustration of it gone wanted to not
see out wanted no out  But I am guessing  The vineyards down the slope
each latent bud beginning to plump  In the distance mountains  Beyond
sea  All of it distraction but from what  A waste of what  The red
sleepmask  I should have burned it with the rest but kept it  The pane
made trees look painted on  Silky  Not good silky  In the next valley once
hammering  Thought it human at first  The woodpeckers went on for
days  A carnival of searching for void  How full void is  Small tufts of
grass growing so that I can keep track  Taking root is not an easy way to
go about finding a place to stay
