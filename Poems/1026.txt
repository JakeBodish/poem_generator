
It was a good idea cutting awaythe vines and ivy trimming back the chest-high thicket lazy years had let grow here  Though it wasn’t for lackof love for the trees I’d like to point out  Years love trees in a way we can’t imagine  They just don’t use the fruit like us they want instead the slantof sun through narrow branches the buckshot of rain on these old cherries  And we now that I think on it want those things too we just always and desperatelywant the sugar of the fruit the best we’ll get from this irascible land sweetness we can gather for years new stains staining the stains on our hands
