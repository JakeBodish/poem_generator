
In a crumpled shirt so casual for a god
Bow tucked loosely under an arm still jittery from battle
He balanced himself on a flat boat painted black 
Each wave as I kneel closer a migrant flag
A tongue with syllables no script can catch The many births you have passed through try to remember them as I do mine
Memory is all you have
