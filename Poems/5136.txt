Come for duty’s sake as girls do we watchThe sly very old woman wile away from her piousAnd stagger-blind friend their daily split of gin She pours big drinks  We think of whatHas crumpled folded slumped her flesh inAnd muddied her once tumbling blood that youngSped her threaded with brave power a TowerNow Babel then of ivory of the ShulamiteCollapsed to this keen dame moving amongHerself  She hums she plays with used brightGhosts makes real dolls and drinking sings Come hereMy child and feeling it dear  A crooking fingerShows how hot the oven is Also she is alive with hate Also she is afraid of hell  Also we wishWe might illiberal uncompassionateRun from her smell her teeth in the dish Even dying her life riots in her  We stand stock stillThough aswarm with itches under her disreputable smiles We manage to mean well  We endure and more We learn time’s pleasure catch our future and its cure We’re dear blood daughters to this every hag and near kinTo any after this of those our mirrors tell us foolishly envy usPresuming us who are young to be beautiful kind and sure  March 1958
