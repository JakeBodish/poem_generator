my own eyes but make of the world a ghazal
whose radif is a haunting of me me me
Somewhere there are fingers still whole
to tell the story of the empire that devours fingers 
Somewhere there is a city where even larvae
cannot clean the wounds of the living
and cannot eat on the countless dead
who are made to die tomorrow and tomorrow 
Carrion beetles and boot bottoms grind corpses
powder-soft to feed the small-mouthed gods
of gardens and wind  Roses made to toss their silk
to earth like immolated gowns hills
spewing ribbons of charred air from cities
occupied by artillery and pilfered grain limbs
blown from their bodies and made into an alphabet
that builds this fool song even now presented
before you as false curative as vacant kiss   even
what is lost in the fabrication of strangers needs naught
from strangers  Even somewhere stings with stillness
stings with a home not surrendered but a given •
But I have not been with my feet on the earth
there where bullets make use of skin like flags
make use of the land  My thinking is as skeletal
as the bombed-out schools and houses
untelevised  What do I know of occupation
but my own colonized thinking to shake
free from  While my days themselves tremble
from time and shake off place to feel falsely
placeless a hollow empathy as if its soft chisel
could make of this wall   my ignorance mighty
before me upon which drawn figures alight
against the stone   my own what is mine is
the wall my votes and non-votes my purchases
wrapped in unthought have built and stretched
undead gray  There are no secrets in debris 
I have a home I hate its steel and lights
red and blue upon me  Home itself a mist
through which I pass and barely notice 
Home to assume you are home is to assume
I am welcome in you   to what degree let the wounds
say so   and can come and go as I please 
The television tells me Over there and one must point
with a fully extended arm to show how far from
how unlike here there really is  Over there
where they blow each other up over land and God 
And it feels good to stretch as if from waking   
this silence could be called a kind of sleep   and thinkbeyond where I am not and where those who are
are not   wall upon which drawings of fists
strike skyward and faces of activists stare into me
from my Google search  Turnstiles separate
home from home  Barbed wire catches clouds
in its coil saws  What do I know of injustice
but having a home throughout which bullets
ballots and brutality trifecta against
people who were here before here was here
and people were brought here to change
the landscape of humanity That word has rolling hills
and towering walls  To hammer against it not to get
to the other side   believe nothing is there   
but to make obsolete side   know there is nothing 
I know this my metaphors have small arms
my wallet has made monstrous my reflection
I have done terrible things by being alive 
I have built a wonder of terror with my life •
 


Image of an eight-meter-tall wall constructed by connected prefabrications  Interspersed among them are surveillances I’ll make them pay  What is closed opens then settles  Spill a scream what makes it  On the wall a body leans which is a caption “This is not prayer ” Which side are you on Here where there is no here endurance measured by a field’s disruption and around it what makes possible a furthering to settle this in court or to settle in this courtyard  Argument this thinking is real because it has been made touchable if touch is the mutual rejection of objects from entering into the other let’s settle this once and for all who’s going to pay for what reaches toward and fails at heaven To settle the debt settle in silence  If it is not silent this roaring is it fire  stone  a pen lifting ban no ban no b    or falling is it home make it so •
Between his war with self and the war
in a sand-sealed country neither of us could spell
juvie took from R what little childhood
Chicago hadn’t taken  Between bloody showers
and rushed meals him forced by bigger boys
until pain became expectation and expectation
pleasure  A shortened sentence meant fighting
for a country against people for whom R held
no hatred while hating the ones he fought for 
There is venom in coercion misnamed loyalty 
Boys and bloody water in his head when he left
to fight in heat and camo  Then in the barrack’s
shower three soldiers raped R  Sand is the Plaza
of Pardon  Wind draws its name across the grains
and leaves the grains with the name it gave 
Who would I be after so many tried to live
in me forcibly R in the desert our Skype
lost connection when an explosion blew out
what little service he had  Oh shitwe been hit  Then blackout silence
and my pulse explicit  Let us rejoice in this
war is a love song that makes your body dangerous
to others that makes you unlivable  You become more
private  You are always early to yourself 
When I saw him again marijuana discharged him
dishonorably and the men inside him shooting guns
and shooting cum went with him  This is one veteran’s
legacy one man I know and have lost to distance
my own pulling me from everything I’m meant to
hold close  What do I know of exile but self-imposed
self-removal  When R kissed my forehead goodbye
the first time I felt citizenly patriotic my white
handkerchief au revoir-ing a friend from my mind
who returned with sand hissing down his pant legs 
A hero is an hourglass  For what
does his countdown drop its grains skull to heel•
One night words came swift
as if prayed for showing
myself to me to correct myselfGrief unhides beneath bombed mosqueswhile the sky blows into pale blue absencedust and vaporized skin Grief and sky unrequited lovers  Whose hurtcould hold the other’s Grief knows the passageof the worm and the temperatures of dirt Sky knows the neon of kite sail and tail Fifteen thousand names written in the airby ribbon rhombi billowed into shieldsglide into the Guinness Book of Records memoriespassed page to page across oceans and treatiesin ink out-blacking smoke  Waves leave soft creaseson the Gaza Strip and know airborne diamondsby the shadows of their measured shapestethered like falcons to a child’s quick hands    
How to mistake American arrogance for love
to think kites could humanize the already-human
and hide the anti-human from its history 
Why cloak our custom of cloaking To make
palatable the blade we turn on ourselves we turn it
on others  In good light the metal will give
us back to ourselves  Does the wolf know
it has a reflection Ask the water if it shows
to us its beast self or has one given to it •
 

Image of an eight-meter-tall wall over which is painted “Is you coming or going or is I” A ray of light ballistic through the form is both answer and rejection of an answer’s possibility •
Tragedy disturbs tragedy 
There can never be just one
way to see the end to ourselves 
The Mediterranean has endless room
where capsized boats of hundreds bloomed
once with refugees  Water can’t be trusted 
The wind with its countless hands hasting
water into waves can’t be seen so can’t be
trusted even though we feel it even when we
know along its unseen force bobs curt hymns
from the dead to the living  We don’t hear them
rising from the salt like fins  We hear bombs
and think Each storm carries the broken criesof a broken nation in its contortion  Alibi
for the living is the land it’s the earth
itself that refuses the dead a home in burr
or field in the stone plateaus or tableaux
of scree from a city of wild boars and roads
that lead to a burning garden a gutted church
a school uniform hemmed by soldiers a birch
limned with blood and pointing dually
west to a row of houses roofless but for crows and east
to a rifle hung above a threshold like a saint 
Something’s always watching well-aimed
and unkind empty and on fire or just-
finished burning  And the water will rust
the skin will extinguish the fire and the flesh 
Baptism is what the living do  The rest
are left to idols of fish and worm are left
with the living’s pens and books bereft
and intricate as mausolea woven from husks
of stories the dead cannot tell  They brux
in our renditions as we cull their truth for our song •
The wilderness within us creeps closer
to the surface of thought and burial 
We drag ourselves from the selves
that laid bear traps that trapped us into our own
dragging one leg limp behind like a memory
pain brings forward  Low grass collects
pockets of our blood as if any gloss
could reduce droughts in the smallest needs 
If we make eye contact with the most beleaguered
of us we pray the remains of god would shower
spears to smite clean such embarrassment  We are not
neighbors just near  We are failures of nature
and the stars burn down through trees no light
we can trust  Because we were shrewd with conviction
the pads of our right hands’ digits have singed
into them one letter each to spell faith  What we touch
with that hand will fell our enemies
who are ourselves  We draw a maze with our blood
follow paths drawn from the cruelties sculpted
into another’s body  I am losted by a child’s missing eye
dead-ended by a family encrusted with shrapnel 
If I follow my own disaster more closely
if I allow buzzards spiraling above prophecy
enough to reveal time as caught in the loop
of their pinions if I remove my shirt
from my bloodied torso and twist
from it my own oil if in my pocket
I find the final ballot before the mine
was tripped in god’s patience if I see my vote
had predicted the immolation of seasons
and the beheading of goats sacrificed to rain
that washed away no blood and emulsified
sickness into the oceans and seas if pain rises
from the mouths of the dead in the shape
the dead took when alive if all this time
we’ve been building tombs and calling them home  •

Hajjar does a body on its back act as the body’s own
grief Is a body downed the mind’s shadow If we must love
our souls does that mean we must love what leaves
