
This is my past where no one knows me These are my friends whom I can’t name Here in a field where no one chose meThe faces older the voices the same Why does this stranger rise to greet meWhat is the joke that makes him smileAs he calls the children together to meet meBringing them forward in single fileI nod pretending to recognize themNot knowing exactly what I should say Why does my presence seem to surprise themWho is the woman who turns awayIs this my home or an illusionThe bread on the table smells achingly real Must I at last solve my confusionOr is confusion all I can feel
