
Oh happy shades to me unblest
   Friendly to peace but not to meHow ill the scene that offers rest
   And heart that cannot rest agree
 This glassy stream that spreading pine
   Those alders quivring to the breezeMight sooth a soul less hurt than mine
   And please if any thing could please 
 But fixd unalterable care
   Foregoes not what she feels withinShows the same sadness evrywhere
   And slights the season and the scene 
 For all that pleasd in wood or lawn
   While peace possessd these silent bowrsHer animating smile withdrawn
   Has lost its beauties and its powrs 
 The saint or moralist should tread
   This moss-grown alley musing slowThey seek like me the secret shade
   But not like me to nourish woe
 Me fruitful scenes and prospects waste
   Alike admonish not to roamThese tell me of enjoyments past
   And those of sorrows yet to come
