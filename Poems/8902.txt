
a child carrying flowers walks toward the new year
a conductor tattooing darkness
listens to the shortest pause
hurry a lion into the cage of music
hurry stone to masquerade as a recluse
moving in parallel nights
whos the visitor when the days all
tip from nests and fly down roads
the book of failure grows boundless and deep
each and every moments a shortcut
I follow it through the meaning of the East
returning home closing deaths door
