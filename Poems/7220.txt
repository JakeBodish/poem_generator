
I HEARD a womans lipsSpeaking to a companionSay these wordsA woman what hustlesNever keeps nothinFor all her hustlin Somebody always getsWhat she goes on the street for If it aint a pimpIts a bull what gets it I been hustlin nowTill I aint much good any more I got nothin to show for it Some man got it allEvery nights hustlin I ever did
