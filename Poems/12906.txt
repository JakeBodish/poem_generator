
This is that blessed Mary pre-elect
     Gods Virgin  Gone is a great while and she
     Dwelt young in Nazareth of Galilee Unto Gods will she brought devout respectProfound simplicity of intellect
     And supreme patience  From her mothers knee
     Faithful and hopeful wise in charityStrong in grave peace in pity circumspect So held she through her girlhood as it were
     An angel-waterd lily that near God
          Grows and is quiet  Till one dawn at homeShe woke in her white bed and had no fear
     At all yet wept till sunshine and felt awd
          Because the fulness of the time was come
