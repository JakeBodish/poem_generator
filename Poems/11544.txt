
The happy ones are almost always also vulgar happiness has a way of thinking thats rushed and has no time to look but keeps on moving compact and manic with contempt in passing for the dying Get on with your life come on buck up Those stilled by pain dont mix with the cheerful self-assured runners but with those who walk at the same slow pace  If one wheel locks and the others turning the turning one doesnt stop turning but goes as far as it can dragging the other in a poor skewed race until the cart either comes to a halt or falls apart
