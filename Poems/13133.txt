
It haint no use to grumble and complane
       Its jest as cheap and easy to rejoice  When God sorts out the weather and sends rain
       Wy rains my choice Men ginerly to all intents 
       Although theyre apt to grumble some Puts most theyr trust in Providence
       And takes things as they come 
               That is the commonality
               Of men thats lived as long as me
               Has watched the world enugh to learn
               Theyre not the boss of this concern With some of course its different 
       Ive saw young men that knowed it allAnd didnt like the way things went
       On this terrestchul ball 
               But all the same the rain some way
               Rained jest as hard on picnic day
               Er when they railly wanted it
               It mayby wouldnt rain a bitIn this existunce dry and wet
       Will overtake the best of men Some little skift o cloudsll shet
       The sun off now and then  
               And mayby whilse youre wundern who
               Youve fool-like lent your umbrell to
               And want it outll pop the sun
               And youll be glad you haint got noneIt aggervates the farmers too 
       Theys too much wet er too much sunEr work er waitin round to do
       Before the plowin s done
               And mayby like as not the wheat
               Jest as its lookin hard to beat
               Will ketch the storm and jest about
               The time the corns a-jintin out These-here cy-clones a-foolin round 
       And backard crops and wind and rain And yit the corn thats wallerd down
       May elbow up again 
               They haint no sense as I can see
               Fer mortuls sech as us to be
               A-faultin Natchurs wise intents
               And lockin horns with ProvidenceIt haint no use to grumble and complane
       Its jest as cheap and easy to rejoice  When God sorts out the weather and sends rain
       Wy rains my choice
