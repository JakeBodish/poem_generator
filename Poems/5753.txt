
I kept a letter from my hometown in Lithuania from onewho still holds a dominion somewhere with her youthful charm In it she placed her sorrow and her affectionA blade of grass from Ponar This blade of grass with a flickering puff of dying cloudignited letter by letter the faces of the letters And over letter-faces in murmuring smolderThe blade of grass from Ponar This blade of grass is now my world my miniature homewhere children play the fiddle in a line on fire They play the fiddle and legendary is their conductorThe blade of grass from Ponar I will not separate from my hometown’s blade of grass My good longed-for earth will make room for both And then I will bring a gift to the LordThe blade of grass from Ponar   Translated from the Yiddish
