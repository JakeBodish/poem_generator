
There is so much sweetness in children’s voicesAnd so much discontent at the end of dayAnd so much satisfaction when a train goes by I don’t know why the rooster keeps cryingNor why elephants keep raising their trunksNor why Hawthorne kept hearing trains at night A handsome child is a gift from GodAnd a friend is a vein in the back of the handAnd a wound is an inheritance from the wind Some say we are living at the end of timeBut I believe a thousand pagan ministersWill arrive tomorrow to baptize the wind There’s nothing we need to do about John  The BaptistHas been laying his hands on earth for so longThat the well water is sweet for a hundred miles It’s all right if we don’t know what the roosterIs saying in the middle of the night nor why we feelSo much satisfaction when a train goes by
