Our diaries squatted toad-like   
      On dark closet ledges    
      Forget-me-not and thistle   
      Decalcomaned the pages 
      But where where are they now
         All the sad squalors
      Of those between-wars parlors 
Cut flowers and the sunlight spilt like soda
      On torporous rugs the photo   
      Albums all outspread    
            The dead
Don’t get around much anymore
