
Salvador if I return on a summer day so humid my thumbwill clean your beard of  salt and if  I touch your volcanic face
kiss your pumice breath please don’t let cops say he’s gangster Don’t let gangsters say he’s wrong barrio  Your barrios
stain you with pollen red liquid pollen  Every day copsand gangsters pick at you with their metallic beaks
and presidents guilty  Dad swears he’ll never returnMom wants to see her mom and in the news
every day black bags more and more of us leave  Parents saydon’t go you have tattoos  It’s the law you don’t knowwhat law means there  ¿But what do they know We don’thave greencards  Grandparents say nothing happens here 
Cousin says here it’s worse  Don’t come you could be           Stupid Salvador you see our black bags
our empty homes our fear to say the war has never stoppedand still you lie and say I’m fine I’m fine
but if  I don’t brush Abuelita’s hair wash her pots and pansI cry  Like tonight when I wish you made it
easier to love you Salvador  Make it easierto never have to risk our lives
