of the Suez Canal and all foreign capital



Perhaps her cook come under the influence
Of a few discreet piastres had spoken
Too indiscreetly  Or just perhaps
On a hot day along the azure of the Mediterranean
Rue Fouad bearing a stream of traffic
To Muhammed Ali Square in a riot
Of klaxons and shouts and the whole city
Gleaming white as it must have from a distance
Perhaps on such a day someone got lucky
And Mme  Sperides at the customs house
Could sense what price she would have to pay
That the official full of apologies
And gold teeth would usher her into
A private room smelling of dark tobacco
That under the drone of the ceiling fans
Her valises would be searched the linings
Cut out the cowhide ripped back
That despite her protests which would be
Useless but obligatory she herself
Would be stripped that finally
Two large diamonds worth a modest villa
Would peek and shine from the elegant crack
Of her ass 
                  Whatever the story
It was not for a boy to know 
I listened at my grandmother’s door
As she spoke in a whisper thieving
A fragment here a word there naked
Jewels   hidden you know where
