
I wait for my shadow to forget me to take that one phantom step that I keep from taking  I wait for the simple flash of a dancers spat upon this one moon of stage-light the minds lonely oval illuminated on the surface of some windless pond or slew  And the old soft-shoe practices to get it right husha-husha-hush in its constant audition of sawdust  Even this choreography of useless wishing is not enough to keep tonight from becoming nothing more than some floors forgotten routine where faded numbered dance-steps silently waltz themselves away  The orchestras now ready to Fauréinto the evenings last song while I try to convince myself to cross this room for the first time all night and rinse whats left in some débutantes silver sequined waterfall hope keeling hopelessly ever closer to the edge  Across the floor other couples sashay on  A tin flask empties itself from asking the shadows last chance now wasted in some chandeliers dim lust
