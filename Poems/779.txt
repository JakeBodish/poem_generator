
I pass a woman on the beach 
We both wear graying hair
feel sand between our toes
hear surf and see blue sky 
I came with a smile 
She came to get one 
No   Im wrong 
She sits on a boulder
by a cairn of stacked rocks 
Hands over her heart
she stares out to sea 
Todays my turn to hold the joy
hers the sorrow
