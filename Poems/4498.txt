
In a dream my dad fell
      from the top of a steep       white       mountain
            down       into a blue       crevasse
            like the space between       two waves
            where the light       shines through       just enough
            to tell you
            you will miss this life dearly 
              The falling took years 
              I could hear him moving through air       and then finally nothing 
  
In another dream       my dad was an angel
      his see-through body dangling in the air
              floating above me       face shimmery like tinfoil
                     and I cried and cried when he told me
                     I can’t come back to earth now       not ever 
                                                                                 When my dad told me
                                                                                      You will always be my daughter
                                                                                            maybe it was like that 
                                                                         Will I be allowed to come back to earth
                                                                         and be your son
