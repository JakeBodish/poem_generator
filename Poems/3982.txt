     I  The Spirit Box
 
Son
 A son is a steadfast keeper of secrets
 a cupped palm a calyxa son is a spirit box listen 
 
I was born after armistice
the fissured cities
 
but slept nights
with a human smoke 
 
And though I never shuddered
from a black rouge
 
of rationed coffee
to keep clean
 
the frost and sullen mud
of a forced march
 
the unspoken the unspeakable
became my life
 
I was a boy bathed in dreams
by a menorah fashioned against
 
the penalty of death
a mysterious klezmer 
 A son is a spirit box imagine 
 
 
     II  Riders on the Back of Silence
 
Son
 
As a boy my old-world aunts and uncles
would weep when I entered the room
 
What did I have to do with sadness
Their cryptic tears
 
and purse-tucked Kleenex
were my own tantalizing
 
Hardy Boys case to crack 
Gradually as a junior detective I grasped
 
how much I resembled
an uncle lost in the war
 
and like the savvy querying boy
at the Passover Seder
 
become a scrupulous man
an inquisitive reporter
 
I set out to track my look-alike’s
my family’s wartime destiny 
 
What my father marshaled against
what my mother endured
 
the unspoken the unspeakable
became my mission
 
though I was born in a venomless
time and suburb
 
phantoms chimeras breathed
in our never-quite-here-and-now house
 
secret calendars of fire
Mother I dreamed we were
 
riders on the back of silence
the wild unsaid beneath us
 horse whalebehemoth 
 
We never spoke of the war 
So with stark reading
 
a well-thumbedDiary of Anne Frank
 
I resolved to imagine
pitiless showers
 
whips and watchtowers
of brute commanders
 
their Gypsy-less Jew-less
jerry-rigged heaven 
 
 
     III  The Photojournalist
 
Son
 
In my search for your cloud-wrapped past
Mother
 
the wounded earth became mine
and each time I aligned myself
 
with the exiled the dispossessed
I aligned myself with you 
 
Apprenticed to obsessed with
light and justice
 
always I’ve tried to bring into focus
a girl with war as her spur
 
with hunger as her horse
and shadow 
 
Mother in El Salvador
I couldn’t lift my camera
 
to capture the unearthed
bodies of silenced nuns
 
I’m almost but never quite
inured to death
 
a child in a jacket of flies
the last typed lines of a friend
 
a dissident poet whose body
was opened beyond belief 
 
In the Secret Annex in the countless
precincts of strife I’ve learned
 
an Esperanto of blood and hope
and forbearance
 
as if someday I might receive my wish
to read on a night as serene as truce
 
your long-awaited story
the capo’s unrelenting curses
 
a castaway’s pain
I should know it by heart Mother 
 
 
     IV  The Antimiracle
 
Mother
 
At the spring’s start there were fists
rather than fragrance
 
April-upon-April hope
braided with arrests and betrayals
 
as dark as the derided
spaces in our censored mail 
 
Garrisons watchtowers
checkpoints as daunting as Gorgons
 
proliferated 
The borders became too-tight belts 
 
Long after the white of truce
in restless sleep I struggled
 
to awaken the family dead
to confess unabashed
 
Lampshades of sullied flesh
linens fashioned of human hair 
 
I was not prepared
to stand outside humanity 
 
 
     V  The Pet Name
 
Son
 
Soft as a fontanelDove was the pet name
 
you gave me as a boy
and on the world’s battlefields
 
like a drop of holy water
its bolstering sweetness
 
became my talisman 
It was with me mitigating winged
 
shielding me somehow
as my lover Jaeger’s lens shattered
 
and his lifeblood
soaked into my shirt 
 
It was with me
a thousand leagues from God
 
when I photographed
a gassed village 
 
whole families
and their livestock hushed
 
as if by an invisible hand
as if some heedless insane baker
 
had dusted the afternoon
with flour 
 
 
     VI  Trains
 
Mother
 
Today amid the earliest birdcalls the first
neighborhood sounds
 
I swept the stoop
leaned on the trusty broom
 
and wondered
If I could write son about those years
 
where would I begin 
Your grandfather was a stationmaster
 
tall as a flagpole
and as taciturn 
 
And though his owl-gray eyes
have gone to earth
 
I keep thinking he’ll round the corner
in his fastidious clothes
 
carrying a sprig of asphodel
or fragrant honeysuckle 
 
so dignified with his gold
spectacles and timetables 
 
God took him the Sabbath before
the shouts and stones the smashed
 
storefronts of Kristallnacht 
How it would’ve angered him to see
 
that his beloved trains
were used to betray us 
 
 
     VII  Dove’s Arc
 
Mother
 
For years I dreamed maternal dreams
of your cozy security 
 
spacious freedom from pogroms
all the misery the wide
 
unmerciful world doles out
to Jews and scapegoats
 
and always you seemed
determined to court danger 
 
So you want to know
about a prisoner’s
 
a Häftling’s dignity
This is what it meant
 
at the roll call
some anchoring wish 
 
or a shared shoe
a black rouge of rationed
 
coffee in the camp
to dodge selection for the flames    
 
Truth to tell
there’s barely been a day
 
when the filth of the barracks
the fury of the camps
 
didn’t obsess my heart
But I will go with you to Birkenau
 
near the slain beasts
of the old crematoriums
 
where everywhere you walk
you are walking on human ash 
 
I want to leave something
sturdy in this world
 
maybe a book
of live-to-tell truth
 
grace and vitamins
for those to come 
 
More than anything son
what I’ve wanted to tell you
 
there was a woman of courage
in the camp
 
and she shepherded me
kindled me to keep me alive 
 
A clear light seemed to shore her
as if we were seeing
 
a one-woman sunrise
an unstoppable human dawn
 
so that she garnered strength to share
her meager scraps
 
strength to carry the ones
still minus an alphabet
 
making up soothing rhymes
little puddles of sound   
 
Like so many
she died of typhus 
 
And after liberation
in the DP camp
 
amid the chaos I prayed
my children would inherit
 
a portion of her spirit 
And it’s true
 
you have some of her fearlessness
her passion you do 
 
Son why didn’t I see it before
How my hardscrabble prayer
 
in it’s dove’s arc
was answered
