
Even now after all
these years my father 89
still uncertain when I call
whose voice it is Anns or mine 
 
saying Hi Dad and from where
the next town or a different state
still pausing in that powdered air
this little silence as he waits
 
at the nursery door discerning tone
and pitch listening hard to know
which way to bend which crib the one
against the wall or by the window
 
still concentrating trying to keep
us separate our needs do whatshe would letting my mother sleep
this moments blank as hes about
 
to choose between us make some shift
in the soft-lit dark decide whose cry
it is tonight which girl to lift
to whisper or hum which lullaby
