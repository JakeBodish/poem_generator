
My ancestors were not diligent
and so they lived beside the fort
thats neither on the maps of Heaven
Nor of Hell 
In these lands there is no difference
between a star and thrown car keys 
Chicken nuggets hatch from the eggs of eagles 
I grow dirty while bathing in bottled water 
My bed comforter is a wet parking lot
I wrap myself up in 
If I eat in the morning theres nothing left in the evening
My dish of grass and cigarette butts topped with expired coupons 
Stir all I like I never swallow it down 
All the while my rabbits foot runs about
from Las Cruces to West Memphis
searching for flawless luck 
The more one cries the more one prospers      
O ancestral demon may my lamentation become verbal sorcery
