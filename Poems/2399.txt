No matter where of comfort no man speakLet’s talk of graves of worms and epitaphsMake dust our paper and with rainy eyesWrite sorrow on the bosom of the earthLet’s choose executors and talk of willsAnd yet not so for what can we bequeathSave our deposed bodies to the groundOur lands our lives and all are Bolingbroke’sAnd nothing can we call our own but deathAnd that small model of the barren earthWhich serves as paste and cover to our bones For God’s sake let us sit upon the groundAnd tell sad stories of the death of kingsHow some have been deposed some slain in warSome haunted by the ghosts they have deposedSome poison’d by their wives some sleeping kill’dAll murder’d for within the hollow crownThat rounds the mortal temples of a kingKeeps Death his court and there the antic sitsScoffing his state and grinning at his pompAllowing him a breath a little sceneTo monarchize be fear’d and kill with looksInfusing him with self and vain conceitAs if this flesh which walls about our lifeWere brass impregnable and humor’d thusComes at the last and with a little pinBores through his castle wall and farewell kingCover your heads and mock not flesh and bloodWith solemn reverence throw away respectTradition form and ceremonious dutyFor you have but mistook me all this whileI live with bread like you feel wantTaste grief need friends subjected thusHow can you say to me I am a king
