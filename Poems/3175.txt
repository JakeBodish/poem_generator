
Its almost May
and yesterday
I saw a firefly 
You dont see
them a lot
in the city 
Sometimes
in the park
in the near dark
one comes out
youll hear
a little kid shoutLightning bug Firefly
Its almost May
and yesterday
I caught a firefly in my hand 
First firefly I
seen in a 
long long time Make a wish
Miss Edna said Make a good one Firefly wishes always come true
