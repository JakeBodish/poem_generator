
Holy father I can’t pretend
I’m not afraid to see you again
but I’ll say that when the time
comes I believe my courage
will expand like a sponge
cowboy in water  My earth-
father was far braver than me   
coming to America he knew
no English save Rolling Stones
lyrics and how to say thanks
God
