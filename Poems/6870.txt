
The dark that’s gathering strength
these days is submissive
kinky silken willing
stretched taut as a trampoline 
World events rattle by like circus
trains we wave at occasionally
as striped homed and spotted
heads poke out their windows 
Feels like I’m wearing a corset
though I haven’t a stitch on 
Burn the place setting I ate from
OK and destroy the easy chair
I languished in  Let birds
unravel my lingerie
for nesting materials 
Fingers poised on the piano keys
I can’t think what to play 
A dirge a fugue
What exactly are crimes
against nature
