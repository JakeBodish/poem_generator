
I too know the science of building men
Out of fragments in little light
Where Ill be damned if lightning dontStrike as I forget one May have a thiefs thumbAnother a murderers armAnd watch the men Ive made leaveLike an idea I meant to write down Like a vehicle stuckIn reverse like the monsterGod came to know the moment Adam named animals and claimed Eve turning from heaven to herAs if she was hisTo run  No word he said could be tamed No science  No design  Nothing taken Gently into his hand or your hand or mine Nothing we erect is our own
