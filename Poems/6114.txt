
You who cannot hear or cannot know
the terrible intricacies of our species our minds
the extent to which we have done
what we have done  yet the depth to which
we have loved
what we have
loved   
the hillside
at dawn dark eyes
outlined with the dark
sentences of  kohl
the fūl we shared
beneath the lime tree at the general’s house
after visiting Goitom in prison for trying to leave
the country the first time
the apricot color of camels racing
on the floor of  the world
as the fires blazed in celebration of  Independence 
How dare I move into the dark space of  your body
carrying my dreams without an invitation my dreams
wandering in ellipses pet goats or chickens
devouring your yard  shirts 
Sea my oblivious afterworld
grant us entry please when we knock
but do not keep us there deliver
our flowers  himbasha bread 
Though we can’t imagine now what
our dead might need above all can’t imagine it is over that they are in fact askless are
needless in fact still hold somewhere
the smell of coffee smoking
in the house please
the memory of joy
fluttering like a curtain in an open window
somewhere inside the brain’s secret luster
where a woman hands red with henna
beats the carpet clean with the stick of a broom the children in the distance choose stones
for the competition of stones  the summer
wears a crown of  beles in her green hair  the tigadelti’s
white teeth  the beautiful bones of Massawa
the gaping eyes  mouths of its arches
worn clean by the sea your breath  your salt 
                                Please you
being water too
find a way into the air  then
the river  the spring
so that your waters can wash the elders
with the medicine of the dreaming of their children
cold  clean
