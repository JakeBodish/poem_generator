
God is not light upon light no more
than goat is need upon need
although there where it grazes it is sun upon coat
within which ticks and stray-blown feed burrow
into the pocked skin of such foul scent
covering the underflesh heart that could eat
this farmers grain or the barren mountains bark
high in the solitude of sheer animal peace
laid over sheer animal terror 
We ask the animal afflicted by its time
its impoverished American meadow
that drove it to find birch from which to strip its easy feed
to abide with us 
It does not need us  We think it needs us 
We must forgive God Gods story
