
Why so many senseless injuries This one’s glass teeth
knocked out  Eyes missing or stuck open or closed 
Limbs torn away  Sawdust dribbles onto the floor
like an hourglass running out  Fingerless hands noses
chipped or bitten off  Many are bald or burnt  Some
we learn are victims of torture or amateur surgery 
Do dolls invite abuse with their dent-able heads
those tight little painted-on or stitched-in grinsHurt me big botched being they whine in a dialect
only puritans and the frequently punished can hear It’s what I was born for  I know my tiny white pantaloons
and sheer underskirts incite violation
