When he got to the farmhouse he rifled through
the cabinets drawers and cupboards
and his buddies did too  The place was abandoned
or so he thought and his buddies did too 
He tried to talk to people in town and his buddies did too
but he was the only one whose Yiddish made it
across into German  They took his meaning 
He in the farmhouse took a camera and a gun
but his buddies who knows  About the gun
it’s also hard to say but after the war he took up
photography why not and shot beautiful women
for years  Got pretty good at it and how 
Won prizes and engraved plates put them in a drawer forgot
the war forgot his buddies forgot the women forgot the drawer
