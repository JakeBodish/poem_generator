I would be one with the dark dark earth Follow the plough with a yokel tread I would be part of the Indian cornWalking the rows with the plumes oerhead  I would be one with the lavish earth Eating the bee-stung apples red Walking where lambs walk on the hillsBy oak-grove paths to the pools be led I would be one with the dark-bright nightWhen sparkling skies and the lightning wed Walking on with the vicious windBy roads whence even the dogs have fled I would be one with the sacred earthOn to the end till I sleep with the dead Terror shall put no spears through me Peace shall jewel my shroud instead I shall be one with all pit-black thingsFinding their lowering threat unsaidStars for my pillow there in the gloom Oak-roots arching about my headStars like daisies shall rise through the earthAcorns fall round my breast that bled Children shall weave there a flowery chainSquirrels on acorn-hearts be fed Fruit of the traveller-heart of meFruit of my harvest-songs long spedSweet with the life of my sunburned daysWhen the sheaves were ripe and the apples red
