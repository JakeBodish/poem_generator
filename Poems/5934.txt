
Out-of-focus photographs
in front of equestrian monuments 
The fog of the drug
low-impact anecdotes
and scenes from badly dubbed films 
With this we arrive at our 40s
and we shouldn’t be ungrateful 
It could be worse 
 

•

The year ending
with the month of parakeets
who didn’t let anyone sleep
with their demented squawking 
The day we lowered our arms
believing we were raising them 
 
•

An arm a fragment of an arm
congealed on the left margin
the photograph in which we’re posing like tourists
in the ugliest city in the world 
An extremity outside the frame
pointing toward a place
without historical value 
That photograph
the mechanics of a smile set in motion
by a signal from the stranger who took it 
 
•

To keep from dwelling on the imminent
let’s speculate about the fate
of a friend from elementary school
who always covered his notebooks in pink 
Or let’s be practical
and calculate our taxes 
 
•

May God keep you she thinks 
Blessings she says 
 
•

Every four months
with technical precision
Mom asks if I’m gay 
 
•

Son leaving the table See you tomorrow 
Mother under her breath God willing 
 
•

Vacation of ’91
before nightfall
downloading the catalogue
of bootlegs The Exorcist on repeat for weeks
to commit the dialogue to memory
15 years later nothing remains 
A vacation’s
useless exercise 
The crisis of our 40s
at 22 
 
•

The weeds grow
when we’re not watching them 
Years accumulate
while we worry about the weeds 
Learning this took
longer than we would have liked 
 
•

“See you tomorrow ”
“If that’s God’s will” she corrects me 
 
•

From the sun surpassed again
by rotation and refraction
a few minutes of orange light are left
flattering the silhouettes
of the park’s elderly unmoving 
This is how it is or this is how I see it through
the extenuating filter
of 10mg of Klonopin 
 
•

The fog of the drug
low-impact anecdotes
and scenes from badly dubbed films 
At that hour of the morning
when the transvestites
begin to grow a beard 
 
•

Vices explain the glassy stare
of someone who saw someone else
ironing the old bills first
on the cleared section of a table
cluttered with stolen appliances
to later meticulously
restore each one with Scotch tape 
 
•

Jorge the gardener is weeding 
“See you tomorrow ”
“God be with you ”

Parents’ house
a gluttonous Sunday
pants unbuttoned
every idea is a capital sin
on the sofa in front of the TV 
They show the movie about someone
with the heart of a baboon
or that’s what he’d been tricked into believing since he was a child
the weak muscle
substituted by a fantasy 
 
•

Succumbing to the interruption
he writes this
“Above the bar where joy had been
they built a cathedral
out of everything that doesn’t belong to me ”
 
•

Succumbing to the interruption
he recites this“Kyrie rex genitor ingenite
vera essentia eleyson ”
 
•

Statistic
“I have photographs that used to be ours ”
A weak heart  No fantasy 
 
•

Years and years
hours and hours
dedicated to exercising the brain
which responds solely to the superficial 
An autonomous organ
dictates the heart’s
  not at all metaphorical   ache 
 
•
 

In my head there’s a homunculus who skips stones also a cripple who drags his dead leg through the sand of the Pacific and the trail that he’s leaving behind looks like the handwriting of someone who’s hurt you and the waves come and the waves erase it 
 

•

Conversations you can’t participate in 
Piles of overdue books 
Keychains without working flashlights 
The line of ants looks like a crack in the wall 
To write on one’s own forearm with the sharp edge of a bitten-off fingernail 
Supermarket rice mustard toothpaste Scotch tape Tylenol 
Jorge the gardener 224-5678 
Supermarket salt 
Conversations you can’t participate in

Off-center photographs
in front of equestrian monuments 
León Cortés’s arm
the shadow of León Cortés’s arm
cast on our 30-year-old biology 
Apart from the extras behind us everything
looks like a Photoshopped montage 
 
•

The children of the Second Republic
reproduced without
thinking fed those who shave
heads and chests and armpits 
Secretly they know it’s Independence Day
August 2nd 
 
•

Every four months
like an auditor
his mother asks if he is an addict 
 
•

May God keep you she thinks 
Bless she says 
 
•

Out-of-focus photographs
photographs of people
who consume anxiolytics
rolled-up in a candy wrapper
while they watch badly dubbed films 
A cinema in the suburbs one afternoon
a screening for the unemployed 
 
•

I have these photographs that used to be ours 
If we superimpose the faces
Linda Blair appears
that transvestite appears
the one we’ve known since elementary school 
 
•

In place of the heart
a stone in the shape
of La Virgen Criolla
who liberated us from the Spanish
from your mother from your brothers from obesity
from understanding the mystery of the Trinity 
 
•

On the coast of the Pacific
we’d watch the fire attentively
as if it were an intelligent TV 
The glitter of gel in your hair
was a host of mortal stars diminutive
extinguishing themselves 
 
•

It could be worse 
This is how we arrive at our 40s 
By the grace of God
the fog will soon disperse
so that we can take a photograph of the group of the country
so that we can begin again where the cripple left off 
 
•

Off-center photographs
every four months
damaged bills
in a pants pocket
the sun as seen from a flat planet
the parakeets that month
when we lowered our arms
believing we were raising them
