
O my Love sent me a lusty list
Did not compare me to a summers day
Wrote not the beauty of mine eyes
But catalogued in a pretty detailed
And comprehensive way the ways
In which he was better than me 
More capable of extra- and inter-
Polation  More well-traveled -rounded multi-
Lingual More practiced in so many matters
More physical artistic musical
Political academic I dare say social
In many ways and ditto sexual”
And yet these mores undid but his own please
And left none-the-less the Greater Moor of me
