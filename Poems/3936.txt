
Your name is Diana Toy 
And all you may have for breakfast is rice gruel 
You cant spit it back into the cauldron for it would be unfilial 
You cant ask for yam gruel for there is none 
You cant hide it in the corner for it would surely be found
and then you would be served cold stale rice gruel 
This is the philosophy of your tong
you the child must learn to understand the universe
through the port-of-entry your mouth
to discern bitter from sweet pungent from bland 
You were told that the infant Buddha once devoured earth
and spewed forth the wisdom of the ages 
Meat or gruel wine or ghee
even if its gruel even if its nothing
that gruel that nothingness will shine
into the oil of your mothers scrap-iron wok
into the glare of your fathers cleaver
and dance in your porcelain bowl 
Remember what they deny you wont hurt you 
What they spare you you must make shine
so shine shine
