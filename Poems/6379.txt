
Somewhere people must still do things like fetch
water from wells in buckets then pour it out
for those animals that long domesticated would
likely perish before figuring out how to get
for themselves  That dog for example whose
refusal to leave my side I mistook as a child
for loyalty   when all along it was just blind     What
is it about vulnerability that can make the hand
draw back sometimes and can sometimes seem
the catalyst for rendering the hand into sheer force
destructive Don’t you see how you’ve burnt almost
all of it all the tenderness away
