Or gallery  Or strange askew museum  Or painting of a hotel bed
with some cheap print above the headboard  Palm tree or a sleigh
pulling Xmas trees  Or the day two-dimensional subzero
as I run the beach along the frozen lake  The waves
lathed to Hokusai spirals  Cold gallery every inch
of wall space covered park benches derbied by snow 
House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright  House for battered women 
House of the servants of His Godhead Reverend Moon
Who plots in some Seoul penthouse His glorious
death and resurrection  Ten minutes ago I left you
to the laying on of hands  Maria talking fast in glottal
Polish and the physical therapist hugely blonde
lifting your legs white cocoons of the casts  First up
then to the sides the hospital bed in the living room
hulking whirring as it moves along with you 
To talk of this and you directly though I can’t 
To heal you with my own hands though I can’t 
Legs not working hands not working tongue encased in plaster 
The tongue going numb with the hands  Why my friend Dave
loves jazz to hammer and obliterate the words
nullify too the wordlessness  “Blue Train” on my Walkman
as the Moonies leave from house to van lugging crates
of silken flowers  Blue pills that didn’t work 
Then my month of yellow pills  To not metamorphose
to my father writhing as the charges surge
from temples down the spine a dog’s twitching legs
in sleep  To mollify with acronyms ECT Odysseuses
and Tristans of PDR yellow Prozac sky blue Zoloft 
To heal you with my own hands though I can’t 
The day two-dimensional  Past and present and to dwell
in neither  Truth-taking stare  Height and width
no depth  On a screen the paramedics ease you
from car to ambulance having labored with a crowbar
at the door and I push again through the crowd
on Thorndale  This is my husband  Please
let him come with me
