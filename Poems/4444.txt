Everyone is invested in policing the Black body  Yes even you  And there’s a particularly virulent investment in the surveillance and policing of the Black Woman née “Female” Body  In fact there are multiple systems most of them economic that hinge upon controlling corralling and commodifying the female body in general  Why do you suppose in the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand and Seventeen the ocean vomited up twenty-six dead Nigerian girls on the gorgeous Mediterranean coast
