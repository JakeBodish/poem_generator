berry budding in water tiger
lilies claiminghocus-pocus wonder  I was broken
vanity vixen vase victorious tête-
à-tête   the Scrabble game nobody wonbecause the tiles aspired speculums 
Ocean-misaligned brook  brook-misalignedagua
  where else could these gospels have dawned
if not in the bellies of men
hyenaing a becomingTwerking in church
I outperformed the candles
diarized in the simpleminded annexation        WussupBlastoise
with the veiniest homeboundpika-pika aim
Wussup SimsChumbawamba Family Portrait SimulationSt  Sunny of the Sissies
beheld the bukkake throngof mojo-coated cartilage
squanderedon the refurbished bunk
for new cetaceans  A dazzling jeremiadshone me dead
until I gridlocked the algebraic expressionsof my body in question marks These syndicated fiyahs
stigmatized my herculean magmashadesbut I held these walls apart
every inch of my mascara cut offapple pie You watched me hobble home
while the streets coalesced magenta  Tell Mommathe holes I cover with one error
