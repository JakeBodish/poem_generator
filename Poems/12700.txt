
Can life be a blessingOr worth the possessingCan life be a blessing if love were awayAh no though our love all night keep us wakingAnd though he torment us with cares all the dayYet he sweetens he sweetens our pains in the takingTheres an hour at the last theres an hour to repay In evry possessingThe ravishing blessingIn evry possessing the fruit of our painPoor lovers forget long ages of anguishWhateer they have sufferd and done to obtainTis a pleasure a pleasure to sigh and to languishWhen we hope when we hope to be happy again
