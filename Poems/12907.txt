
She fell asleep on Christmas Eve
     At length the long-ungranted shade
     Of weary eyelids overweighdThe pain nought else might yet relieve Our mother who had leand all day
     Over the bed from chime to chime
     Then raisd herself for the first timeAnd as she sat her down did pray Her little work-table was spread
     With work to finish  For the glare
     Made by her candle she had careTo work some distance from the bed Without there was a cold moon up
     Of winter radiance sheer and thin
     The hollow halo it was inWas like an icy crystal cup Through the small room with subtle sound
     Of flame by vents the fireshine drove
     And reddend  In its dim alcoveThe mirror shed a clearness round I had been sitting up some nights
     And my tired mind felt weak and blank
     Like a sharp strengthening wine it drankThe stillness and the broken lights Twelve struck  That sound by dwindling years
     Heard in each hour crept off and then
     The ruffled silence spread againLike water that a pebble stirs Our mother rose from where she sat
     Her needles as she laid them down
     Met lightly and her silken gownSettled no other noise than that Glory unto the Newly Born
     So as said angels she did say
     Because we were in Christmas DayThough it would still be long till morn Just then in the room over us
     There was a pushing back of chairs
     As some who had sat unawaresSo late now heard the hour and rose With anxious softly-stepping haste
     Our mother went where Margaret lay
     Fearing the sounds oerhead should theyHave broken her long watchd-for restShe stoopd an instant calm and turnd
     But suddenly turnd back again
     And all her features seemd in painWith woe and her eyes gazd and yearnd For my part I but hid my face
     And held my breath and spoke no word
     There was none spoken but I heardThe silence for a little space Our mother bowd herself and wept
     And both my arms fell and I said
     God knows I knew that she was dead And there all white my sister slept Then kneeling upon Christmas morn
     A little after twelve oclock
     We said ere the first quarter struck
 Christs blessing on the newly born
