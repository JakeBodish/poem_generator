
This morning we found ourselves skinning a deer
cutting meat hanging some to dry and packaging
some for the freezer  It was the dogs late last night
 
that set off a howling the unexpected smell of fresh
blood floating down the block then a familiar car
horn honking in the driveway  My nephew and his
 
friends were hunting and brought us a deer  Mother
always said “Cut up the meat right away don’t let
it sit ” I look at a front quarter a hole filled with
 
coagulated blood  Grandma says not to eat the part
next to the wound “Cut it out offer it to the earth for
healing a sacrifice to remember the hungering spirits ”
 
Auntie says to save the muscle along the back strap
“It makes good thread ” I carefully learned the exact
place to cut the joints so the bones separate easily 
 
Mother said that is important “It means you are a
thoughtful person ” Auntie is at the door waiting for
a roast  “An elder takes the first piece” she reminded 
 
Mom tells me to save the hooves for her  She wants
to make a bone game for the new grandchild wants
him to be patient and skillful  I boil the hoofs with
 
sage find the little toe-bones for her  My hands begin
to ache from the work I soak them in warm water
and start again  I admire the placement of tendons
 
on the deer shoulders no joints just the crisscrossing
of muscle  Grandma says “That’s why your dad called
them jumpers they bounce off the strength of their
 
flexing muscles ” Late at night Mom helps me stake
out the hide  My back hurts my feet feel like I’ve
been walking on rocks all day  I want to complain
 
but Mom catches the look in my eyes  She says to me
“When you get dressed for the dance this weekend
you will proudly wear your beautiful beaded dress
 
your beaded leggings and moccasins and last but not
least you will put on your beaded belt and attached
you will wear your sharp knife and quilled knife sheath
 
because of what you have done this day ”
