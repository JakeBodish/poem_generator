
There  is a  sorceress in our night   A  sky  that  only  moves  memory to make
place  for  the  mangoes of last month   There is an old man who says  Libéremoi   And  means  Take  everything   but  my  blackness   Only  in the dark do
doves  find   reason   Only  in  the  dark  do  doves  have  reason to believe that
vengeance  is  light  hanging  on  fallen  tree   After each  fall we  ask where is
the   island   the  sugarcane  that  disappeared  in  our hunger  the  water that
emptied  our  thirst  the  song   that  robbed  our  nightmare   They  mock  us 
They  tell  us to  whisper in their ears   They will obey   But  curses  beat  the air
wild   The air is faint   And they tell us Stop plotting fire  You are in the wrongland even if the roosters recognize you  They hated our black  What they didnt
understand is that it illuminates their world
