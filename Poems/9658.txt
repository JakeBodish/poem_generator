
We knew the rules and punishments
three lashes for lack of diligence
eight for disobeying mother
or telling lies     No blood he’d sayand no remission  Came a day
he started keeping my account
as at a store  And came another
he called me to the tannery
a Sunday day of settlement 
I’d paid one-third the owed amount
when he to my astonishment
handed the blue-beech switch to me 
Always the greatest of my fears
were not his whippings but his tears
and he was tearful now  I dared
not disobey nor strike him hard 
“I will consider a weak blow
no blow at all rather a show
of cowardice” he said  No blood
and no remission
