If it became impossible to touch and be touched to see
and be seen to love and trade ecstasy for risk where risk
is ecstasy to be hidden in plain view to be perfectly lost
which means lost to the world lying side-by-side arms linked
in a bond so intricate it could never unfold or break 
If it became crucial to live out of sight to be housebound
to walk a beaten path in the garden to sit at the window
blurred by rainfall to sit barred and blocked books
set aside that would never be read rolling news of flash flood
and fire angels treading the updraft a chaos of voices 
If dreams should give the rest of it the path in the garden
going underground flood and fire as God’s only gift
the house holding its secrets that pattern of locked rooms
what lies outside voices angels crowding the perimeter You could make an installation of itand why not on a bare floorin a bare hall under neon stripwhat seems thrown down what seemsheap after heap of discards but is nothair and shoes and spectaclesand clothes teeth also savedrepetition such that it blursimages folding into one anotherabstract just shape being evidentexcept this shoe exceptthis lens catching the light which iserror or artifact something likeiron litter carefully thrown downby Joseph Beuys but more the brightgrotesque of Bacon’s Fragmentof Dubuffet’s L’Arbre de fluideswhat’s torn what’s wrenched apart    Heap after heap grainy footageof a cattle train snowscapesmokestacks scratch orchestra whatmore do you need     dogs     what moredo you need of this the trainall but silent in snow footageof carcasses thrown down nakedyou could make a montage of itquick hands a low sun deepeningto yellow by trees and towersthe way shadows are cast the lightyou need the shapes you needa sureness of touch to bring it alltogether perhaps a light boxfragments and fractures backlitand all of a piece not leastthe new dead they liein a scatter your focal pointthey make sudden brokenangels in the snow Fool steps up  His art is palimpsest He’ll tag your work spray-painta ditzy orange bug-eyed frogat the door of the charnel housecolor the snowscape blue redactthe chimneys configure the trainwith silver-and-black chevronsa snake drawn up to the iron gatehis artwork Evil is as evil does The frog spits bile  The snakeis hollow-eyed  He addsspeech bubbles to the cold still air“Hosanna Hosanna Ho sa nna”Children in a pool of light a pool of dust the wayimages deceive the way time shunts and stalls a testof what gathers and corrupts what will not stayas words unspeak as children are lost to light and dust
