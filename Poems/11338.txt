
Haze of wave spume towards Small Point 
    Seguin Island Light like a whales spout  maybe life washes itself here cools off  
    It never comes clean  See all the sails up and full in the windy parade of skin 
    and sand and brine  Soon the rocks will pluck each waves feathers  Soon the beach 
    like the moon waning will be 18th its size  Somewhere else maybe Ireland the tide 
    will bottom out then  For now the sun blesses the bodies at home in theirs 
    and those less so to ruin and ruins aftermath  whatever that is and the waves rolling in 
    little snowplows nimbus in miniature how the beach fishhooks east one child  
    is that mine or some spirit I was one more usher of face up arms and legs 
    scraping a temporary angel in the sand
