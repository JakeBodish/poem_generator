
Its too soon for the front porch swing 
No crocuses are opeing 
The wind is from the north and chill No matter  Spring is here  I stillAm bound to sit and swing out thereAnd feel it in the evening air 
Its much too cold  The trees are lean
And leafless not a sign of green 
Its foolishness to sit outside The mockingbird has testified To springs existence and I seeThe buds are on the almond tree Im sure its spring 
How do you knowI think a cricket told me so
