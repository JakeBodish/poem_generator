
My father was four years in the war
and afterward according to my mother
had nothing to say  She says he trembled
in his sleep the next four years 
My father was twice the father of sons
miscarried and afterward said nothing 
My mother keeps this silence also 
Four times my father was on strike
and according to my mother had nothing
to say  She says the company didn’t understand
nor can her son the meaning
of an extra fifteen cents an hour in 1956
to a man tending a glass furnace in August 
 
I have always remembered him a tired man 
I have respected him like a guest
and expected nothing 
It is April now 
My life lies before me
enticing as the woman at my side 
Now in April I want him to speak 
I want to stand against the worn body
of his pain  I want to try it on
like a coat that does not fit
