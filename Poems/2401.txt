The raven himself is hoarseThat croaks the fatal entrance of DuncanUnder my battlements  Come you spiritsThat tend on mortal thoughts unsex me hereAnd fill me from the crown to the toe top-fullOf direst cruelty Make thick my bloodStop up th access and passage to remorseThat no compunctious visitings of natureShake my fell purpose nor keep peace betweenThe effect and it Come to my womans breastsAnd take my milk for gall you murdring ministersWherever in your sightless substancesYou wait on natures mischief Come thick nightAnd pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hellThat my keen knife see not the wound it makesNor heaven peep through the blanket of the darkTo cry Hold hold
