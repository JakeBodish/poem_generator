And into the heavens as on a bright day after rainthere came the shapes of four creaturesand they each had the likeness of a manand each man had four wings outstretchedand each wing had four eyes emblazoned wide opengiven to weeping at the worlds they containedan eye-world of light of fire and airof water and its mirror heart and its first fearand in each world were four namesentangled in its forest of letterswhereupon I could read Dow Jones CargillChevron and DeKalb of the frozen seedbearing but once and giving up its need and under each name were discovered four meaningsliteral figurative rational dimand under each meaning a counter-meaning with its likeness of Freud Marx Hegel and Lacan and the four figures passed as one overheadtheir wingtips linked like molten silver joined For I Ezekiel had been given to eatthe very substance of God and my eyes were open and my mouth spakeas spring opens winter and winter closes falland the earth turned rightly to my senses sweet Son of man they called me a proverb and a sign Say I am a sign of the city the cauldronwhere men burn down to desire  Say I am the proverb of nothing and oneboiling over the fire rising out of beliefand falling like a tyrant out of derision alone And lo a likeness as of the appearance of firethe error of presence of nothing as oneand lo another likeness the appearance of water the error of absence of something as nonefor water surrounds all shapes that enterbut has no shape of its own and fire is the shape of ruin alone For the princes of the sea shall cast their garments upon the land’s endtheir scholar’s robes sharkskin suits and alligator shoes their NikesReeboks and Chuvashian mittensknitted by the children of shepherds by tinsmiths and ladies’ men in the dark at the back of the store for the princes of fire consume what they love with the reckless ambition of gods Yea as I spake to dry bones that lay upon the earththey danced into being and chattered one and onedown the hallways of my desert the thresholds of my river For the Lord builds ruined palaces and plants desolationhe receives what is absent possesses all that is gone
