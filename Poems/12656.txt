
When thou poor excommunicate
  From all the joys of love shalt seeThe full reward and glorious fate
  Which my strong faith shall purchase me
  Then curse thine own inconstancy A fairer hand than thine shall cure
  That heart which thy false oaths did woundAnd to my soul a soul more pure
  Than thine shall by Loves hand be bound
  And both with equal glory crownd Then shalt thou weep entreat complain
  To Love as I did once to theeWhen all thy tears shall be as vain
  As mine were then for thou shalt be
  Damnd for thy false apostasy
