
I collect them now it seems  Like sea-shells or old thimbles  One for Father  One forMother  Two for my sweet brothers  Odd how little they require of me  Unlike theones they were sent in memory of  No sudden shrilling of the phone  No harriedmidnight flights  Only a little water now and then  Scant food and light  See how I’vebrought them all together here in this shaded space beyond the stairs  Even when theythirst they summon me with nothing more than a soft indifferent furl- ing of their leaves ﻿
