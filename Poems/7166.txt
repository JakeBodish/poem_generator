
Its little I care what path I take And where it leads its little I care But out of this house lest my heart break I must go and off somewhere Its little I know whats in my heart Whats in my mind its little I know But theres that in me must up and start And its little I care where my feet go I wish I could walk for a day and a night And find me at dawn in a desolate place With never the rut of a road in sight Or the roof of a house or the eyes of a face  I wish I could walk till my blood should spout And drop me never to stir again On a shore that is wide for the tide is out And the weedy rocks are bare to the rain  But dump or dock where the path I take Brings up its little enough I care And its little Id mind the fuss theyll make Huddled dead in a ditch somewhere   Is something the matter dear she said  That you sit at your work so silently  No mother no twas a knot in my thread    There goes the kettle Ill make the tea
