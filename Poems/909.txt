
From morn to midnight all day throughI laugh and play as others doI sin and chatter just the sameAs others with a different name And all year long upon the stageI dance and tumble and do rageSo vehemently I scarcely seeThe inner and eternal me I have a temple I do notVisit a heart I have forgotA self that I have never metA secret shrine and yet and yetThis sanctuary of my soulUnwitting I keep white and wholeUnlatched and lit if Thou shouldst careTo enter or to tarry there With parted lips and outstretched handsAnd listening ears Thy servant standsCall Thou early call Thou lateTo Thy great service dedicate
