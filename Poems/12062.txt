The blackbird sings atthe frontier of his music The branch where he satmarks the brink of doubtis the outpost of his realmedge from which to routencroachers with trillsand melismatic runs sur-passing earthbound skills It sounds like ardorit sounds like joy  We are gladhere at the borderwhere he signs the airwith his invisible staves“Trespassers beware” Song as survival a kind of pure music whichwe cannot rival
