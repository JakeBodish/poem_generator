
Last summer two discrete young snakes left their skin
on my small porch two mornings in a row  Being
postmodern now I pretended as if I did not see
them nor understand what I knew to be circling
inside me  Instead every hour I told my son
to stop with his incessant back-chat  I peeled
a banana  And cursed God His arrogance
His gall to still expect our devotion
after creating love  And mosquitoes  I showed
my son the papery dead skins so he could
know too what it feels like when something shows up
at your door twice telling you what you already know
