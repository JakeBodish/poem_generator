
Who won I said 
The game’s tomorrow he said 
And I became the snail I always was
crossing the field in my helmet 
But I’d given it my all
while the plane arced on its way
to a landing when I overheard
the woman behind us sayI was gathering wildflowers to make a wreath
to lay on my mother’s grave when my son
fell off a mountain in Italy
