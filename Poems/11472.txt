Her daughter wrote back to say my friend had died                      my friend to whom I wrote a letter maybe twice a year  From time to time Id pictured her amid strange foliage                      and in a Mongol yurt for she was fond of travel  Why not a flock of something darkening the sky so we would know                      ah so-and-so is gone For a woman from the city this might perhaps be pigeons                      blacking out the sun  Or else a human messenger as once when she was fabric shopping                       bolt of green silk furled across her body Garbo passed and nodded  At Macys years ago                       when I was not a creature in her world  Of course she bought the cloth but never sewed the dress                      a massive stroke and I take comfort in the fact                            she felt no pain  Logic says we should make omens of our Garbos and our birds                      but which one bears the message which one just the mess  From the kayak Ive seen pigeons nesting underneath the pier                      a dim ammoniated stink where one flew into my face  I read this as a sign                       that rancid smash of feathers but couldnt fathom what it meant trapped in the lag-time                      of an oracles translation  Foolish mind wanting to obliterate the lag and why                       let memory wait to catch up to its sorrow
