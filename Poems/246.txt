You play beside a death-bed like a child
Yet measure to yourself a prophets place
To teach the living  None of all these things
Can women understand  You generalise
Oh nothing–not even grief Your quick-breathed hearts
So sympathetic to the personal pang
Close on each separate knife-stroke yielding up
A whole life at each wound incapable
Of deepening widening a large lap of life
To hold the world-full woe  The human race
To you means such a child or such a man
You saw one morning waiting in the cold
Beside that gate perhaps  You gather up
A few such cases and when strong sometimes
Will write of factories and of slaves as if
Your father were a negro and your son
A spinner in the mills  Alls yours and you–
All coloured with your blood or otherwise
Just nothing to you  Why I call you hard
To general suffering  Heres the world half blind
With intellectual light half brutalised
With civilization having caught the plague
In silks from Tarsus shrieking east and west
Along a thousand railroads mad with pain
And sin too     does one woman of you all
You who weep easily grow pale to see
This tiger shake his cage–does one of you
Stand still from dancing stop from stringing pearls
And pine and die because of the great sum
Of universal anguish–Show me a tear
Wet as Cordelias in eyes bright as yours
Because the world is mad You cannot count
That you should weep for this account not you
You weep for what you know  A red-haired child
Sick in a fever if you touch him once
Though but so little as with a finger-tip
Will set you weeping but a million sick    
You could as soon weep for the rule of three
Or compound fractions  Therefore this same world
Uncomprehended by you must remain
Uninfluenced by you  Women as you are
Mere women personal and passionate
You give us doating mothers and chaste wives 
Sublime Madonnas and enduring saints
We get no Christ from you–and verily
We shall not get a poet in my mind 
With which conclusion you conclude    
                                    But this–
That you Aurora with the large live brow
And steady eyelids cannot condescend
To play at art as children play at swords
To show a pretty spirit chiefly admired
Because true action is impossible 
You never can be satisfied with praise
Which men give women when they judge a book
Not as mere work but as mere womans work
Expressing the comparative respect
Which means the absolute scorn  Oh excellent
What grace what facile turns what fluent sweeps
What delicate discernment     almost thought
The book does honour to the sex we hold 
Among our female authors we make room
For this fair writer and congratulate
The country that produces in these times
Such women competent to     spell 
                                Stop there
I answered–burning through his thread of talk
With a quick flame of emotion–You have read
My soul if not my book and argue well
I would not condescend     we will not say
To such a kind of praise a worthless end
Is praise of all kinds but to such a use
Of holy art and golden life  I am young
And peradventure weak–you tell me so–
Through being a woman  And for all the rest
Take thanks for justice  I would rather dance
At fairs on tight-rope till the babies dropped
Their gingerbread for joy–than shift the types
For tolerable verse intolerable
To men who act and suffer  Better far
Pursue a frivolous trade by serious means
Than a sublime art frivolously 

Then I spoke 
I have not stood long on the strand of life
And these salt waters have had scarcely time
To creep so high up as to wet my feet 
I cannot judge these tides–I shall perhaps 
A womans always younger than a man
At equal years because she is disallowed
Maturing by the outdoor sun and air
And kept in long-clothes past the age to walk 
Ah well I know you men judge otherwise
You think a woman ripens as a peach–
In the cheeks chiefly  Pass it to me now
Im young in age and younger still I think
As a woman  But a child may say amen
To a bishops prayer and see the way it goes
And I incapable to loose the knot
Of social questions can approve applaud
August compassion christian thoughts that shoot
Beyond the vulgar white of personal aims 
Accept my reverence 
                  There he glowed on me
With all his face and eyes  No other help
Said he–no more than so
                    What help I asked 
Youd scorn my help–as Natures self you say
Has scorned to put her music in my mouth
Because a womans  Do you now turn round
And ask for what a woman cannot give
For what she only can I turn and ask
He answered catching up my hands in his
And dropping on me from his high-eaved brow
The full weight of his soul–I ask for love
And that she can for life in fellowship
Through bitter duties–that I know she can
For wifehood     will she
                      Now I said may God
Be witness twixt us two and with the word
Meseemed I floated into a sudden light
Above his stature–am I proved too weak
To stand alone yet strong enough to bear
Such leaners on my shoulder poor to think
Yet rich enough to sympathise with thought
Incompetent to sing as blackbirds can
Yet competent to love like HIM
                            I paused
Perhaps I darkened as the lighthouse will
That turns upon the sea  Its always so
Anything does for a wife 
                      Aurora dear
And dearly honoured     he pressed in at once
With eager utterance–you translate me ill 
I do not contradict my thought of you
Which is most reverent with another thought
Found less so  If your sex is weak for art
And I who said so did but honour you
By using truth in courtship it is strong
For life and duty  Place your fecund heart
In mine and let us blossom for the world
That wants loves colour in the grey of time 
With all my talk I can but set you where
You look down coldly on the arena-heaps
Of headless bodies shapeless indistinct
The Judgment-Angel scarce would find his way
Through such a heap of generalised distress
To the individual man with lips and eyes–
Much less Aurora  Ah my sweet come down
And hand in hand well go where yours shall touch
These victims one by one till one by one
The formless nameless trunk of every man
Shall seem to wear a head with hair you know
And every woman catch your mothers face
To melt you into passion 
                      I am a girl
I answered slowly you do well to name
My mothers face  Though far too early alas
Gods hand did interpose twixt it and me
I know so much of love as used to shine
In that face and another  Just so much
No more indeed at all  I have not seen
So much love since I pray you pardon me
As answers even to make a marriage with
In this cold land of England  What you love
Is not a woman Romney but a cause
You want a helpmate not a mistress sir–
A wife to help your ends     in her no end
Your cause is noble your ends excellent
But I being most unworthy of these and that
Do otherwise conceive of love  Farewell 
Farewell Aurora you reject me thus
He said 
        Why sir you are married long ago 
You have a wife already whom you love
Your social theory  Bless you both I say 
For my part I am scarcely meek enough
To be the handmaid of a lawful spouse 
Do I look a Hagar think you
                          So you jest
Nay so I speak in earnest I replied 
You treat of marriage too much like at least
A chief apostle you would bear with you
A wife     a sister     shall we speak it out
A sister of charity 
                 Then must it be
Indeed farewell And was I so far wrong
In hope and in illusion when I took
The woman to be nobler than the man
Yourself the noblest woman–in the use
And comprehension of what love is–love
That generates the likeness of itself
Through all heroic duties so far wrong
In saying bluntly venturing truth on love
Come human creature love and work with me–
Instead of Lady thou art wondrous fair
And where the Graces walk before the Muse
Will follow at the lighting of the eyes
And where the Muse walks lovers need to creep
Turn round and love me or I die of love 
With quiet indignation I broke in 
You misconceive the question like a man
Who sees a woman as the complement
Of his sex merely  You forget too much
That every creature female as the male
Stands single in responsible act and thought
As also in birth and death  Whoever says
To a loyal woman Love and work with me
Will get fair answers if the work and love
Being good themselves are good for her–the best
She was born for  Women of a softer mood
Surprised by men when scarcely awake to life
Will sometimes only hear the first word love
And catch up with it any kind of work
Indifferent so that dear love go with it
I do not blame such women though for love
They pick much oakum earths fanatics make
Too frequently heavens saints  But me your work
Is not the best for–nor your love the best
Nor able to commend the kind of work
For loves sake merely  Ah you force me sir
To be over-bold in speaking of myself–
I too have my vocation–work to do
The heavens and earth have set me since I changed
My fathers face for theirs–and though your world
Were twice as wretched as you represent
Most serious work most necessary work
As any of the economists  Reform
Make trade a Christian possibility
And individual right no general wrong
Wipe out earths furrows of the Thine and Mine
And leave one green for men to play at bowls
With innings for them all     what then indeed
If mortals were not greater by the head
Than any of their prosperities what then
Unless the artist keep up open roads
Betwixt the seen and unseen–bursting through
The best of your conventions with his best
The unspeakable imaginable best
God bids him speak to prove what lies beyond
Both speech and imagination A starved man
Exceeds a fat beast well not barter sir
The beautiful for barley –And even so
I hold you will not compass your poor ends
Of barley-feeding and material ease
Without a poets individualism
To work your universal  It takes a soul
To move a body it takes a high-souled man
To move the masses     even to a cleaner stye
It takes the ideal to blow a hairs breadth off
The dust of the actual –ah your Fouriers failed
Because not poets enough to understand
That life develops from within –For me
Perhaps I am not worthy as you say
Of work like this     perhaps a womans soul
Aspires and not creates yet we aspire
And yet Ill try out your perhapses sir
And if I fail     why burn me up my straw
Like other false works–Ill not ask for grace
Your scorn is better cousin Romney  I
Who love my art would never wish it lower
To suit my stature  I may love my art
Youll grant that even a woman may love art
Seeing that to waste true love on anything
Is womanly past question
