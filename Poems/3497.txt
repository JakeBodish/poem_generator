
Asleep until noon Im dreaming
weve been granted another year 
Youre here with me healthy 
Then half-awake the half-truth 
this is our last day  Lifes leaking
away again and this time we know it 
Dear body I told you pleadingDont Leave but I understand you
cant say anything  Who are we
Are we fictional We dont look
like our pictures dont look like
anyone I know  Daylight
flickers through a bamboo grove
we approach the Forbidden City
Looking together for the Hall
of Fulfilling Original Wishes Time is the treasure you tell meand the past is its hiding place 
I instruct our fictional childrenThe past is the treasure time
is its hiding place  If we told him
how much we love him how much
we miss him he could stay
