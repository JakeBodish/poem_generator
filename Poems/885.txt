
My days among the Dead are past    Around me I beholdWhereer these casual eyes are cast    The mighty minds of oldMy never-failing friends are theyWith whom I converse day by day With them I take delight in weal    And seek relief in woeAnd while I understand and feel    How much to them I oweMy cheeks have often been bedewdWith tears of thoughtful gratitude My thoughts are with the Dead with them    I live in long-past yearsTheir virtues love their faults condemn    Partake their hopes and fearsAnd from their lessons seek and findInstruction with an humble mind My hopes are with the Dead anon    My place with them will beAnd I with them shall travel on    Through all FuturityYet leaving here a name I trustThat will not perish in the dust
