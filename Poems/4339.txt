
Ten below high of zero 411 pm
flashed the alarm panel’s handsome blue touchscreen 
Without commotion or fire the afternoon
passed slowly full of promise
then disappointment 
Without heartbreak or break-in 
For company I had Kafka on my lap
and Qolsys vibrating lightly against the wall 434           435           There are all sorts of creatures in the world I readwretched limited dumb creatures
who have no language but mechanical cries
