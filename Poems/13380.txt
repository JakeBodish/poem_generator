
At dusk on those evenings she does not go out   
my mother potters around her house    
Her daily helpers are gone there is no one   
there no one to tell what to do
she wanders sometimes she talks to herself   
fondly scolding sometimes she suddenly   
throws out her arms and screams high notes   
lying here and there on the carpets   
like bodies touched by a downed wire
she journeys she quests she marco-polos through   
the gilded gleamy loot-rooms who is she    
I feel now that I do not know her
and for all my staring I have not seen her
 like the song she sang when we were small   I wonder as I wander out under the sky   
how Jesus the Savior was born for to die   
for poor lonely people like you and like I
