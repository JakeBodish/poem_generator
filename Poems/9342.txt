Cross-hatchings palm and rain
clapboard faded
to the grain half-shutters
open to old vines and mangroves
draining their own shadows
recollecting what the body knows
suspended between coral
and shifting images of cloud    
After death
after the knowledge
of deathhis death
his face unwrapped
already yellowed
papery recovered
with a small white cloth
then lowered away
and shut to the earth
So pierced
so mute
these words
re-opening Not this

The rain had gone  I swam against the current
harnessed by water till I turned and swung
out with the tide shouldering deep
into a rhythm of my own long strokes
pulled under the body and returning
past the glinting crease in which I breathed
the sea half-woken like another body
bedded into sheer transparency
the outer reaches granular with light 
Comebacks  Chains of radiance 
Far more than meet the eye 
What do they meet then intimate
but otherworldly mimicking the world
I looked back at the land’s thin edge
pines along the shoreline near a fort
where cannons rust mouths left open among
thistleweed around the dozing moat 
Far back among fallen needles pigeons shuffle
through shade their feathers iris underlight
soft flares bob the dark 
The land had disappeared 
The sun had followed it  From either wrist
half-mingled with my breath into the night
a trail of ungloved phosphor travelled back

Sounds too have their surfaceswithin
the mortal frame particles of blood
revolve as in a sort of heaven where
breath moves through us as an unseen light
but when the marrow bonds are parted they in turn
set loose what has been called the soul
