
In the sixth grade I was chased home by
the Gatlin kids three skinny sisters
in rolled-down bobby socks  HissingBrainiac and Mrs  Stringbean they trod my heel 
I knew my body was no big deal
but never thought to retort whos
calling who skinny Besides I knew
theyd beat me up  I survived
their shoves across the schoolyard
because my five-foot-zero mother drove up
in her Caddie to shake them down to size 
Nothing could get me into that car 
I took the long way home swore
Id show them all I would grow up
