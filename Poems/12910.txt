
I have been here before
          But when or how I cannot tell
     I know the grass beyond the door
          The sweet keen smellThe sighing sound the lights around the shore 
     You have been mine before 
          How long ago I may not know
     But just when at that swallows soar
          Your neck turnd soSome veil did fall I knew it all of yore 
     Has this been thus before
          And shall not thus times eddying flight
     Still with our lives our love restore
          In deaths despiteAnd day and night yield one delight once more
