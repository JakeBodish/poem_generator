
Rudolph Reed was oaken 
His wife was oaken too 
And his two good girls and his good little man
Oakened as they grew 
“I am not hungry for berries 
I am not hungry for bread 
But hungry hungry for a house
Where at night a man in bed
”May never hear the plaster
Stir as if in pain 
May never hear the roaches
Falling like fat rain 
“Where never wife and children need
Go blinking through the gloom 
Where every room of many rooms
Will be full of room 
”Oh my home may have its east or west
Or north or south behind it 
All I know is I shall know it
And fight for it when I find it “
It was in a street of bitter white
That he made his application 
For Rudolph Reed was oakener
Than others in the nation 
The agent’s steep and steady stare
Corroded to a grin Why you black old tough old hell of a man
Move your family in
