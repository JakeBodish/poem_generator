This tiny ruin in my eye small
flaw in the fabric little speck
of blood in the egg deep chip
in the windshield north star
polestar floater that doesnt
float spot where my hand is not
even when Im looking at my hand
little piton that nails every rock
I see no matter if the picture
turns to sand or sand to sea
I embrace you piece of absence
that reminds me what I will be
all dark some day unless God
rescues me oh speck
that might teach me yet to see
