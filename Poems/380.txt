
In the apparent
vacancy beyond
each line you might
sense the poem
 
waiting to think
itself  Imagine
the surface of a twilight
pond in wind
 
shifting and changing
the sky then
going still
as a concentrating mind
 
the far trees
deepening
in its reflection 
Like the poem
 
the pond’s alive 
its beauty the sudden
scintillation of a hundred
thousand wavelets
 
and music the percussion
of a beaver’s tail
arising from what is 
And when the pond
 
accumulates
the darkness
which it loves
it challenges your eyes
 
to find the light
that without darkness
you could not see 
Wild campsites
 
you never noticed
now appear
along the far shore 
It’s not only itself
 
the poem waits for
moving line by line
into its own dark 
It waits for you
