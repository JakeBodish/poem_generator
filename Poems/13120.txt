
What needeth these threnning words and wasted windAll this cannot make me restore my prey To rob your good iwis is not my mindNor causeless your fair hand did I display Let love be judge or else whom next we meetThat may both hear what you and I can sayShe took from me an heart and I a glove from her Let us see now if thone be worth thother
