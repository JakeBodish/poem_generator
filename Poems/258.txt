A missile is shaped like a pencil 
its long slender body and pointed
end creates history 
 
A girl walking down the street
a few steps ahead of her sister and friend
two medics who were trying to help
injured people the parked ambulance 
all were annihilated by the same weapon 
 
Above drones silent unmanned planes 
A metal predatory bird that shoots a missile
with precision identifying the colors of a shirt
the features on a face the shape of a nose
the color and length of a mustache 
 
In a room far away in another country a man
sits at a desk and looks at a screen he strokes
his thick dark mustache as he carefully
contemplates then pushes a button 
 
There is a charred hole in the ground
where the girl once stood 
 
There are pencils that write and erase
write and erase so that there is nothing
to be read on the page  The page blank
as the desert sky blank as the smooth shell of a drone 
 
There is a family drinking mint tea
in a living room 
The man holds a cup to his lips
the glass touches his mustache 
A silent bird hovers above 
In a split second everyone is dead
the house is in rubbles arms legs
splattered organs among broken concrete 
 
Soon there will be no trace
