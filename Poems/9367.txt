
The telephone company calls and asks what the fuss is 
Betty from the telephone company who’s not concerned
with the particulars of my life  For instance
if I believe in the transubstantiation of Christ
or am gladdened at 702 in the morning to repeat
an eighth time why a man wearing a hula skirt of tools
slung low on his hips must a fifth time track mud
across my white kitchen tile to look down at a phone jack 
Up to a work order  Down at a phone jack  Up to a work order 
Over at me  Down at a phone jack  Up to a work order
before announcing the problem I have is not the problem
I have because the problem I have cannot occur
in this universe though possibly in an alternate
universe which is not the responsibility or in any way
the product child or subsidiary of ATT  With practice
I’ve come to respect this moment  One man in jeans
t-shirt and socks looking across space at a man
with probes and pliers of various inclinations nothing
being said for five or ten seconds perhaps I’m still
in pajamas and he has a cleft pallet or is so tall
that gigantism comes to mind but I can’t remember
what causes flesh to pile that high five or ten seconds
of taking in and being taken in by eyes and a brain
during which I don’t build a shot gun from what’s at hand
oatmeal and National Geographics or a taser from hair
caught in the drain and the million volts of frustration
popping through my body  Even though  Even though his face
is an abstract painting called Void  Even though
I’m wondering if my pajama flap is open placing me
at a postural disadvantage  Breathe I say inside my head
which is where I store thoughts for the winter  All
is an illusion
