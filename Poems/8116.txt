
I once hit clothespins   
for the Chicago Cubs    
Id go out after supper   
when the wash was in   
and collect clothespins   
from under four stories   
of clothesline    
A swing-and-a-miss   
was a strike-out   
the garage roof Willie Mays   
pounding his mitt   
under a pop fly    
Bushes a double   
off the fence triple   
and over home run    
The bleachers roared    
I was all they ever needed for the flag    
New records every game 
once 10 homers in a row   
But sometimes Id tag them   
so hard theyd explode   
legs flying apart in midair   
pieces spinning crazily   
in all directions    
Foul Ball What else   
could I call it   
The bat was real
