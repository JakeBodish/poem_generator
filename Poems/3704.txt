
Not to be confused with messenger pigeons birds sent behind enemy lines in war but think passengers as in birds carrying suitcases sharing a berth on a train or traveling in bamboo cages on a ship always migrating on a one-way to extinction  How would extinction look on a graph A steady climb or a plateau then a precipitous cliff at the dawn of humans
 
Nesting grounds eight hundred square miles in area  Skies swollen with darkening multitudes  Days and days of unbroken flocks passing over  Ectopistes migratorius 
 
And the last of the species Martha named for Martha Washington dies in a cage in 1914 at the Cincinnati Zoo 
 
Forget clemency  We are the worst kind of predator not even deliberate in our destruction  Our killing happens à la carte on the side side of Dodo 
 
And because the nineteenth century did not enlist a battlefield artist for extinctions there are no official witnesses to the slaughter just participants  If you could somehow travel back to this scene through the would-be canvas you would run flailing your arms toward the hardwood forests and the men with sticks and guns and boiling sulphur pots to bring birds out of the trees as if you could deliver 50000 individual warnings or throw yourself prostrate on the ground as if your one body could hold sway
