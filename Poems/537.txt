
The Roman candle of a yard light
caramelizes the old snow 
The glow trespasses the dark hold
of December dimming the view
 
of the night sky with its winter
triangle a boy strains to see
through the haze as he lets his jacket
hang open unzipped to the cold 
 
He knows to return through
the black cleft between buildings
below electric wires that seem
to carry a little train of snow
 
on their slim rails where he throws
the switch that shuts off the bulb
on its pole that opens the dome
to a blast of stars in outer space
 
to the pinpoint of Jupiter
to the constellation of Orion hunting
the Great Bear that the boy follows
to find a smudge of gray–he can gaze
 
through that peep hole to another
galaxy also spangled with radiance
from stars that traveled two
and a half million light years
 
before appearing as a signal
in the rod cells of his eyes
that pass impulses through
neurons and nerves
 
to his brain that creates images 
He draws in a sharp breath
the high voltage power box
of his chest hot and humming
