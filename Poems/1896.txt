
As phantoms direct life from the shadows
 
                                                                              I feel
I leaned on something
                                          and it broke 
 
My father on the porch with his crosswords said
this must be what it feels like to be dead
 
When I returned from the dead there was no one to greet me
but still you are glad 
 
I wander the ruins the way my tongue
wanders my missing teeth
the bricks and mortar of Deep Deuce
rotted like molars in an ancient mouth
 
Here Charlie Christian might have walked 
 
The astrologer counseled patience
and creative imaging

You visualize her green boots inside the furnace      
 
 No  You are in a crematorium and you see
her perfect and corruptible body on a tray sliding into fire
 
Then you see yourself cutting the rope that ties you together with a saw
 
And then at last your own imperfect and corruptible body I mean me calls out
 
and I jump in after her
