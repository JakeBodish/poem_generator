did you say
August ponds
ought to have
been surrounded
by September fences
but did you say
September fences
ought to have
been climbed over
by October peoples
what did you say
for October padlocks
that ought never to have
been attached moreover
to November handcuffs
II 
Youll remember us for our dark Hungarian laughter
That tickled when it laughed that dug at the limelight
Why Ill send you a dark silver Hungarian coin
From the mines that never saw the light of day yet
Why Ill send you a dimes worth of Hungarian damage
That has been done to a cave that is full of Rhapsody
Why Ill send you a silver key to the cave of despair
Ill send you a violet tonight Ill send you a silver sword
Ill send you a silver hammer thatll hammer night and day
Ill send you a pail-ful of our kinds of blue revolutionary stars 
III 
Who are you Werent you their prisoner in the sedge dark
Where has been your search for freedom
Will you count the trees again in these dense woods
Wherever you have been tonight
Will you look backwards where you have been
And tell me whoever you are 
What have been your escapes
Nevertheless freedom is as ever an intense girl angel
That speaks to me one in the inane wilderness
Where has been your phantasmagoria
Are the dark trees at war with the darklike trees
Where has been your light
Where has been your swordy well
Where has been your darklike table
Did you ever search for another star
