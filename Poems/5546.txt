
My eyes are shaky and glimmer like the stars My head turns to the left and it movesjust like a pendulum  The kids laugh and shakeit back to me all the ways I’m stupidnot like them  But I know how the grass soundswhen the locusts come like a spaceshiptaking off and how it makes the air shake Captain Lovell I heard it in the branchesand the leaves  I heard the rocket leaving My teacher said it wasn’t so that you’repast hearing but my father said I could He puts his hands hard on my shouldersfrom behind and holds my head stillwith his looking  But I can feel how muchI want to shake and let myself go looseand double like a cloud of mayflies on the lakeyou know just how they rise so you couldn’tsee just one of them not even with your thumbheld up to catch one with your eyes  It’s somethingI can’t do that Babe and David can can’t sightthe stars or use a telescope or ever fire a gun Dr  Lovell I like to think you’re spinningand can’t feel it like I can’t feel the world shakeunless I’m really tired and then it’s like a giftto let it go and just stop trying so hard  I liketo think you let go too and when the kidsrun at me and move their heads from leftto right and call me “Zigzag” I look upand wish myself up there with youjust calm and swinging through the stars
