
I write the tall grass is a third wish
then back away
from the field  If I move
back
far enough everyone in the front row
will be still 
Be still 
you’re witnessing my first time 
A ballooning ballroom expanding
until the beat drops
a letdown
letting you down gently
before the DJ jumps up afraid to play
something that could offend 
I write the tall grass is a third wish
wasted
