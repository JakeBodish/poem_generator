
Death is careless at times  It confuses love with a wet afternoon in an empty
room   The  unpainted walls a reminder of how sex can resemble poverty   A
hollow  cry    An open mouth falling inside as you sleep    I prepare  my heart
and language with better words  like worlds in small selves  Ive built   Every
month  one dollar buys me one brick   But  how many bricks  does  it  take to
build a house  A stray dog barks late at night   I cant  see him  but know hes
there    He   reminds   me   that  here  dreams  have  dangerous  turns   I  turn
around  to  no  one  naked  beside  me  I  play  it  safe  not to see the fire in my
hands   But let us be clear  Im no beggar   Its  just that there are times  when 
the  world  is  a  sound  that  cripples  the air  and the soul  When what seems
arranged   glazing and  strange  like  music  played on tin cans   turns  into
wilting  noise   When  suddenly  all  that  exists  is  a small boy trying to focus
on the pain lifting a nation   A telephone call  He was wearing black shoes a 
Calvin  Klein  T-shirt  that he  found in a hotel trash brown slacks   She  was
wearing  one  earring  on her right ear  one sock on her left foot a dress the
color  of sky   She  bought him  a canne à sucre   He pulled her close said Ti
cherie    And  after  they  promised  to meet  later   she  winked  and  walked
leisurely in the shade  A tremble followed  When he turned around her body
was one of a thousand on the streets  He ran towards her stood by her armunable to see her face  The call drops  I begin to count the ways I tolerate my
dry mouth  To count the glasses of water I gave away to make up for my sins 
But this act does not count when we fall out of our hearts
