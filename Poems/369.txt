
I’m back again scrutinizing the Milky Way           
    of your ultrasound scanning the dark                                                                 
        matter the nothingness that now the heads say           
   is chockablock with quarks and squarks
gravitons and gravatini photons and photinos  Our sprout   
 
who art there inside the spacecraft                
    of your Ma the time capsule of this printout                
        hurling and whirling towards us it’s all daft           
   on this earth  Our alien who art in the heavens
our Martian our little green man we’re anxious     
 
to make contact to ask divers questions           
     about the heavendom you hail from to discuss                     
         the whole shebang of the beginning and end           
    the pre-big bang untime before you forget the why
and lie of thy first place  And our friend 
 
to say Welcome that we mean no harm we’d die              
    for you even that we pray you’re not here                     
       to subdue us that we’d put away           
   our ray guns missiles attitude and share
our world with you little big head if only you stay
