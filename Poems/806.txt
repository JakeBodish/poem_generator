
At the 100-year-old National Elk Refuge
near Jackson Hole we might askHow long does an elk liveWho’s an old elk here 
 
We’d like to spend time
with an elder elk please 
Tell us how to balance our lives
on this hard edge of human mean
mean temperatures what we do and don’t
want to mean 
 
Closing the door
to the news will only make you
stupid snapped my friend
who wanted everyone to know as much
as she did  I’m hiding in old school books
with information we never used yet 
Before I drove before I flew
before the principal went to jail 
Sinking my eyes into tall wooden
window sashes dreaming of light
arriving from far reaches
our teacher as shepherds
school a vessel of golden hope
you could lift your daily lesson
in front of your eyes
stare hard and think
this will take me
somewhere  O histories of India
geological formations of Australia
ancient poetries of China Japan
someday we will be aligned in a place
of wisdom together 
 
Red deer wapiti running elk rising
above yellow meadows at sundown 
An elk bows her head  In the company
of other elk she feels at home 
And we are lost on the horizon now
clumsy humanity
deeper into the next century than we
can even believe
and they will not speak to us
