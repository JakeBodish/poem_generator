Britains statesmen oft the fall foredoom Of foreign tyrants and of nymphs at home Here thou great Anna whom three realms obey Dost sometimes counsel take and sometimes tea         Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort To taste awhile the pleasures of a court In various talk th instructive hours they passd Who gave the ball or paid the visit last One speaks the glory of the British queen And one describes a charming Indian screen A third interprets motions looks and eyes At evry word a reputation dies  Snuff or the fan supply each pause of chat With singing laughing ogling and all that         Meanwhile declining from the noon of day The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray The hungry judges soon the sentence sign And wretches hang that jury-men may dine The merchant from th Exchange returns in peace And the long labours of the toilet cease  Belinda now whom thirst of fame invites Burns to encounter two adventrous knights At ombre singly to decide their doom And swells her breast with conquests yet to come  Straight the three bands prepare in arms to join Each band the number of the sacred nine  Soon as she spreads her hand th aerial guard Descend and sit on each important card First Ariel perchd upon a Matadore Then each according to the rank they bore For Sylphs yet mindful of their ancient race Are as when women wondrous fond of place         Behold four Kings in majesty reverd With hoary whiskers and a forky beard And four fair Queens whose hands sustain a flowr Th expressive emblem of their softer powr Four Knaves in garbs succinct a trusty band Caps on their heads and halberds in their hand And parti-colourd troops a shining train Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain         The skilful nymph reviews her force with care Let Spades be trumps she said and trumps they were         Now move to war her sable Matadores In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors  Spadillio first unconquerable lord Led off two captive trumps and swept the board  As many more Manillio forcd to yield And marchd a victor from the verdant field  Him Basto followd but his fate more hard Gaind but one trump and one plebeian card  With his broad sabre next a chief in years The hoary Majesty of Spades appears Puts forth one manly leg to sight reveald The rest his many-colourd robe conceald  The rebel Knave who dares his prince engage Proves the just victim of his royal rage  Evn mighty Pam that kings and queens oerthrew And mowd down armies in the fights of loo Sad chance of war now destitute of aid Falls undistinguishd by the victor Spade        Thus far both armies to Belinda yield Now to the baron fate inclines the field  His warlike Amazon her host invades Th imperial consort of the crown of Spades  The Clubs black tyrant first her victim died Spite of his haughty mien and barbrous pride What boots the regal circle on his head His giant limbs in state unwieldy spread That long behind he trails his pompous robe And of all monarchs only grasps the globe        The baron now his diamonds pours apace Th embroiderd King who shows but half his face And his refulgent Queen with powrs combind Of broken troops an easy conquest find  Clubs Diamonds Hearts in wild disorder seen With throngs promiscuous strow the level green  Thus when dispersd a routed army runs Of Asias troops and Africs sable sons With like confusion diffrent nations fly Of various habit and of various dye The piercd battalions disunited fall  In heaps on heaps one fate oerwhelms them all         The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts And wins oh shameful chance the Queen of Hearts  At this the blood the virgins cheek forsook A livid paleness spreads oer all her look She sees and trembles at th approaching ill Just in the jaws of ruin and codille  And now as oft in some distemperd state On one nice trick depends the genral fate  An Ace of Hearts steps forth The King unseen Lurkd in her hand and mournd his captive Queen He springs to vengeance with an eager pace And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace  The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky The walls the woods and long canals reply         Oh thoughtless mortals ever blind to fate Too soon dejected and too soon elate Sudden these honours shall be snatchd away And cursd for ever this victorious day         For lo the board with cups and spoons is crownd The berries crackle and the mill turns round  On shining altars of Japan they raise The silver lamp the fiery spirits blaze  From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide While Chinas earth receives the smoking tide  At once they gratify their scent and taste And frequent cups prolong the rich repast  Straight hover round the fair her airy band Some as she sippd the fuming liquor fannd Some oer her lap their careful plumes displayd Trembling and conscious of the rich brocade  Coffee which makes the politician wise And see through all things with his half-shut eyes Sent up in vapours to the barons brain New stratagems the radiant lock to gain  Ah cease rash youth desist ere tis too late Fear the just gods and think of Scyllas fate Changd to a bird and sent to flit in air She dearly pays for Nisus injurd hair        But when to mischief mortals bend their will How soon they find fit instruments of ill Just then Clarissa drew with tempting grace A two-edgd weapon from her shining case So ladies in romance assist their knight Present the spear and arm him for the fight  He takes the gift with revrence and extends The little engine on his fingers ends This just behind Belindas neck he spread As oer the fragrant steams she bends her head  Swift to the lock a thousand sprites repair A thousand wings by turns blow back the hair And thrice they twitchd the diamond in her ear Thrice she lookd back and thrice the foe drew near  Just in that instant anxious Ariel sought The close recesses of the virgins thought As on the nosegay in her breast reclind He watchd th ideas rising in her mind Sudden he viewd in spite of all her art An earthly lover lurking at her heart  Amazd confusd he found his powr expird Resignd to fate and with a sigh retird         The peer now spreads the glittring forfex wide T inclose the lock now joins it to divide  Evn then before the fatal engine closd A wretched Sylph too fondly interposd Fate urgd the shears and cut the Sylph in twain But airy substance soon unites again  The meeting points the sacred hair dissever From the fair head for ever and for ever        Then flashd the living lightning from her eyes And screams of horror rend th affrighted skies  Not louder shrieks to pitying Heavn are cast When husbands or when lap-dogs breathe their last Or when rich China vessels falln from high In glittring dust and painted fragments lie        Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine The victor cried the glorious prize is mine While fish in streams or birds delight in air Or in a coach and six the British fair As long at  Atalantis shall be read Or the small pillow grace a ladys bed While visits shall be paid on solemn days When numrous wax-lights in bright order blaze While nymphs take treats or assignations give So long my honour name and praise shall live What time would spare from steel receives its date And monuments like men submit to fate Steel could the labour of the gods destroy And strike to dust th imperial towrs of Troy Steel could the works of mortal pride confound And hew triumphal arches to the ground  What wonder then fair nymph thy hairs should feel The conquring force of unresisted steel
