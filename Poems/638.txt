
Tagus farewell that westward with thy streams
Turns up the grains of gold already tried
With spur and sail for I go seek the Thames
Gainward the sun that showth her wealthy pride
And to the town which Brutus sought by dreams
Like bended moon doth lend her lusty side 
My King my Country alone for whom I live
Of mighty love the wings for this me give
