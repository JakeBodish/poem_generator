
The horse in harness suffers
hes not feeling up to snuff 
The feelers sensate but the cook
pronounces lobsters tough 
The chains too short The dogs at pains
to reach a sheaf of shade  One half a squirrels whirling there
upon the interstate  That rough around
the monkeys eye is cancer  Only Gods
impervious hes deaf and blind  But hes
not dumb to answer for it all his spokesmen
arent allowed to come
