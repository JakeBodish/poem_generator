
Everything has gender
in Arabic 
History is male 
Fiction is female 
Dream is male 
Wish is female 
Feminine words are followed
by a circle with two dots over 
They call it the tied circle
knotted with wishes
which come true only when forgotten
or replaced by the wishes of others 
In the town of tied wishes
people feel great anticipation
because a stranger will arrive
today in her feminine sign 
Someone says he saw her
two dots glittering
refuting another’s vision
of a cat’s eyes hunting in darkness So scary he says how the moon
hides in her red circle
