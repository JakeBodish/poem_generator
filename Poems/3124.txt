
Im remembering again the day
we stood on the porch and you smoked
while the old man told you
about his basement full of wine
his bad heart and the doctors warning
how he held the dusty bottle out to you
glad he said to give it away
to someone who appreciated
its value and spirit the years
it took to settle into its richness
and worth  Im watching again
each cell alive as you reach
for the wine your forearm exposed
below the rolled sleeve the fine hairs
that sweep along the muscle glowing
lifting a little in the afternoon breeze 
Im memorizing the shape of the moment
your hand and the small bones
lengthening beneath the skin
as it tightens in the gripping
in the receiving of the gift the exact
texture and color of your skin
and the old mans face reduced
to its essence  That
and the brief second
when both of you had a hand on the bottle 
the thing not yet given
not yet taken but held
between you stoppered full 
And my body is flooded again
with an elemental joy
holding onto it against another day
in the unknowable future when Im given
terrible news some dark burden
Ill be forced to carry  I know
this is useless and cant possibly work
but Im saving that moment for balance
