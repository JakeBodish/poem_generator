
Id search for Philippines in History class 
The index named one page moved on to Pierce The Making of America marched past
my enigmatic fathers place of birth 
The week he died some man we didnt know
called up  This is his brother one more shockphoning for him  He died three days ago 
The leaden black receiver did not talk 
My uncle never gave his name or town
we never heard from him  Was it a dream
The earpiece roar dissolved to crackling sounds
a dial tone erased the Philippines 
And yet my world grows huge with maps crisscrossed
my History alive with all Ive lost
