
Well its six oclock in Oakland
and the sun is full of wine
I say its six oclock in Oakland
and the sun is red with wine
We buried you this morning baby
in the shadow of a vine
Well they told you of the sickness
almost eighteen months ago
Yes they told you of the sickness
almost eighteen months ago
You went down fighting daddy  Yes
You fought Death toe to toe
O the egrets fly over Lake Merritt
and the blackbirds roost in trees
O the egrets fly over Lake Merritt
and the blackbirds roost in trees
Without you little papa
what O what will become of me
O its hard to come home baby
To a house thats still and stark
O its hard to come home baby
To a house thats still and stark
All I hear is myself
thinking
and footsteps in the dark
