
My father scolded us all for refusing his liquor  He kept buying tequila and steak for the grill until finally we joined him making margaritas cutting the fat off the bone  When he saw how we drank my sister shredding the black labels into her glass while his remaining grandchildren dragged their thin bunk bed mattresses first out to the lawn to play then farther up the field to sleep next to her I think it was then he changed something in him died  Hes gentler now quiet losing weight though every night he eats the same ice cream he always ate only now hes not drinking he doesnt fall asleep with the spoon in his hand he waits for my mother to come lie down with him
