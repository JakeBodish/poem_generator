
I was someones
honors student once
a sticker a star 
I aced Home Ec and Geometry
 
I learned to stab a fork
steer my mothers car 
Old enough to work
I refreshed the salad bar
 
at Steak  Ale
scarcity a line
I couldnt fail 
The summers between university
 
interned at ATT
in the minority
outreach they called Inroads 
My boss Vicki had two
 
roommates whom she
called simply The Gays
crashing on her floor 
That was before
 
I was gay I wont try to say
with a straight face 
Like anyone really cares
I care  What Im trying to say
 
all this prepared
me for these squat blinking
office accessories 
The dry drinking
 
after the accidental reply-all 
By now theres a lot to lose 
Little by little I have become
so careful no talk
 
of politics or orientation
I let them say hes “a homosexual”
without an arch correction 
At a fondue buffet
 
in Zurich our dumb-
founded senior group
director when I let slip
damn it my trip
 
with a twenty-year-old inquired
Theyre always over seventeen
right I told her of coursegod yes and seething smiled
 
which Im famous for 
I didnt want to scare
her  But I tell you
Im keeping score 
 
E-mail is no more
than a suicide
Id like to please recall 
Note my suicide 
 
Im paid to multitask
scramble the life
out of fun
Monday I will ask 
 
every dash a loaded gun
every comma a knife 
you to bury the black-box file
