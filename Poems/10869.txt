
Pale hands I loved beside the Shalimar   Where are you now Who lies beneath your spellWhom do you lead on Raptures roadway far   Before you agonise them in farewell Oh pale dispensers of my Joys and Pains   Holding the doors of Heaven and of HellHow the hot blood rushed wildly through the veins   Beneath your touch until you waved farewell  Pale hands pink tipped like Lotus buds that float   On those cool waters where we used to dwellI would have rather felt you round my throat   Crushing out life than waving me farewell
