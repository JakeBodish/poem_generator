“Ah neva seen this before in all ma years ”
Testify Sis  How we grew accustomed
Spoiled almost by decorum now try
Mosquito larvae cultivating at speed
In standing bodies of water  Pigeons
Flock rooftops twist launch shout
As one spin sky turn skulls porous 
Car repair shop drills sing industry 
Tires feel out parking meters freed 
First horn blare triggers this chorus 
Step up pistons fire motor mouths
Say our only worry is our worst fears
Come true  Mosquito straw proboscis
Drinks from my arm bam Adios asterisk •
But really am I eyeballing an armored truck
Says one dung beetle to half earthworm
Who replies as Gloucester I see it feelingly 
Who gave those uniforms permission to storm
School car parks automatics drawn Finches ask
Robins who channeling Auden whistle   
Bang WTFBang bang Lulu
Lulu gone        
The calypso worked its juju
On my digital radio 
Flags at half-mast for this Union 
Taps on trumpets dawn till dusk 
Guides Scouts look out for rainbows
Projected on a disused warehouse in LA County 
Clocks throughout the land tell one contiguous time 
Rain and shine stop dead in tracks on borderlines •
Cat asks me if dogs can ever be cool After two of my kind pin down one of hisOn a front porch until chased off by our rulers 
I open my mouth to spit some piety aboutLions lying down with lambs but only barkWhat my genes say I should ears pulled back 
Do you remember Judas Iscariot Thirty silverPieces and a certain last supper just for this A taser for every problem warns the bee
With an empty bonnet sting for emphasisAbout why one plus one never makes twoAfter voting from sea to oil-slicked sea 
Look at her look at him hold kiss babiesIn photo ops all gaga minus bathtubNever mind water in this national soap
This wait for the next sentence whose weight“Illegals” carry on shoulders they look overNonstop even in sleep one eye open
Breath held when police cruise byCar backfire skin jump heartbeat skipDay in day out glory hallelujah do I have
A witness as empire zips into bonfire For what To dip wrists in fresh waterFrom an inverted fountain in a square •
Black lives matter but blue lives matter more  Duh 
Veins blue blood plus or minus B this or A that 
Epicurus I find your coin staring up at me
From the bottom of my beer mug too late
For Troy for Trayvon  I need a flotation device
A buoy Woolf’s lighthouse and single room
Garvey’s Star Line to beam me up Scotty 
Where is yesteryear’s full moon that silvered
Towers and made a midnight lake of the city
Where lovers strolled hand in hand one black
One white with no mind for anyone and no two
Minds in their business Gone the way of drones
Whose shadows crossed the moon without trace
On GPS to sow grief in the name of cod liver oil 
Spell it out or risk talk stuck in ecofriendly caves 
Black and blue both why can’t we intoned
Rodney not Walter get along Because
Because because fill in the dots with your
Trotsky or Brodsky and your Marx Groucho 
Laugh therapy narrows eyes blocks ears
Hurts jaws ribs merrily merrily cha-cha  Cha •
Eek-A-Mouse blasts my buds as I read
The instruction manual which says
One thing but leads to another
When I piece it together finally 
It being the thing I refuse to name 
My nerves porous as that strainer
I hold over a tilted pot full of spaghetti
In hot water  Pavarotti in the shower
Malcolm before a cracked mirror
Gaga at each news item competing
For part Fool  Ornate abandoned nest
Left in place in my suburban rafter
Squirreled from without a note
Unless feathers could ever be a sign
Of things to come of what once was •
Face Beckett’s door imperceptibly ajar 
His stage direction for how things
Turn out here if this show goes on 
Sir Ian why reserve your last check
For your flies before you take the stage
Because all eyes alight there first 
Mr  Spock where is the logic in this
I marvel at comics from my youth
In 4K LED  Captain put me ashore 
By which I mean at sea with sirens
Ears unwaxed sternum lashed to bow 
What is your name Kunta  Whip 
Am I not a     asked Sizwe in Fugard 
You are trans on loan from genes
Dust waves particles here today •
Go-go in la-la land whines craft for art’s saké 
See that chrysalis hanging like a mural 
Should it stop unfolding hold back
Dues suspend when wings peel gloves
Snake free take flight remind the greed
In our chi Che cha what turns without
Turning If you must know but first
Shush write milk in lemon juice on foolscap
Read by passing over Bunsen  Mercurial
Chemists we were all Curie  Cooked crack
Ready to pay any price to find out if love
Could ever be a portion all you would need
To spin Mercator a tad faster on whiteout
Poles match our heart tap rat-a-tat burst •
1   Hummingbird feeder needs refill
2   Peel sticker off window that says glass
3   Buy T-shirt with directive mind the gap
4   Sip tea from mug of civil rights dead
5   Breathe in sure but really exhale
6   Note how breeze lifts a whole branch
7   Whose green skirt shows white undies•
I mean certain legends about flight that grow up with right minds to help them come to terms with change that may be out of their control 
Lone branch ranges from a curved palm 90 feet over LA’s 1914 craftsman in historic Adams  How flayed branch cruises broadcasts a specific gravity geared to flight of the right kind slow bracing reluctant noncommittal inevitable and resigned to its fate 
Through double-glazing I hear so I believe that swoosh of storied capital decline swish perhaps almost a whistle as you wish much like us as kids with a clasped blade of grass held to our pursed lips for that didgeridoo that was elevator music to us atonal types 
But how can a branch sing if made to move on by wind and rain from where it began and thought it would end even if a philosophy spread among shoots of a final sail set for another dimension
As word of government raids spread through town and university we forwarded emails Instagrams and stopped with neighbors in streets to exchange the latest 
Is this time for emergency measures or are we too blind to know what we can feel coming a mile away where someone who knows someone we know stops for bread milk eggs and is grabbed handcuffed and carted off to detention Imagine us as branches dislodged in a sea change helped by soft water  We cling not to give up on all we know  What for That fall we must accept as fate •
Juggernaut ancestors shape-shift cumulus
March across dull blue grass to bagpipes 
Change bandages on Grandmother 
Amputated right hand she says she feels
Rainy days in Georgetown as a firm handshake
That rattles all 27 phantom bones makes her shiver 
Grandfather never averts his bifurcated lens
From his Golden Treasury unless his hanky readies
To catch eyewater at the blurred sight of her 
In a time of airships of toothpicks operated
Behind hand cover  Whoever you vote for
Runs the calypso the government gets in
Ting-a-ling-a-ling  Doan tek serious thing
Mek joke bannoh  WTF  Twin towers got us
Here  Nah Reagan  Nope slavery  Try again 
Irony that republic of deferred action 
Hummingbird smashes into that glass door
My mother walks absently into it too 
I glance just in time brake and catch a face
That I look through to my final destination •
K Street in South London Now
How One morning at 630
I crossed Blackheath Hill 
On my paper round
Met a scrawny fox halfway
Uphill down not sure 
We paused inhaled each
Other fox-trotted away
In a slight panic
Me thinking tabloid
Headlines rabid animal
Chases paper kid
On delivery route 
Follow as I buzz myself
Into a tower
Board elevator a man
In a suit exits
With the merest nod 
Climb 8 floors carry
That fox and just as I plunge
The folded Mirror
Into letter box
Door ajar flies open wham
A very pregnant
Woman naked swollen breasts
Blazing redhead small
Burning bush at crotch
Fills doorframe scrambles my head 
She takes one moment
To compute I am
Not her partner slams door smack
In my wide-eyed face 
That moment as she
Processes me and I her
Stretches out enough
For me to see her
Shoulder-length red flaming curls
And inverted red
Triangle tuft at her crotch
Bright stretched skin at her
Distended navel
An outie as though
I crashed at high speed and could
Recall the lead up
Frame by stark frame for
Posterity mine and hers
Her child near its term 
The rest of my round
I peer left right near distance
Round bends for said fox 
I conjure woman
Pregnant framed by her threshold
Here now with only
Me you these measures
This emergency all three
To foster connect all •
Lap up 70s Airy Hall Guyana 
One road in and one road out
One of everything village
Caiman donkey peacock
And mad expat Englishman
Footloose and fancy-free
Who we stone with red sand
That crumbles on contact
Grabbed from the roadside
That acts as giant bow
Strung with two-story house
Whose Greenheart frame
Tensed held all this time 
English pelted for saying
Down his big burnt nose
That he was sent here
To rule us half-clad children
That he in his better days
Seeing better times before
Guyana’s famous red rum
Got the better of him
Helped sow high and low
And everything between
Our town and country •
Maestro we played shoots
Planted in one place
Sprouts in disorderly rows
Up whole feet if you look away
For a spell all loaded
In one hammock strung
Between rafters in a back room
Empty until harvest
Stuffed paddy from roof
To pillar to post 
Rice husk smell for days 
Rocking chair song and dance
On full moons donkey-bray
At midday peacock-scream
Various most afternoons •
Now help bring barefoot
Pale instep cracked heel stamping
Englishman back not to curse
Stone or ridicule but to hear
How he would remedy this now
So out of sync with then •
Once more help us•
Parse wheat from chaff•
Quantify this voting•
Result that tests our gall •
Stepped-on alligator Uncle•
Takes for a log bridge•
Until it lifts shakes yawns •
Velocity of legs cycling air
Caiman not alligator
Lassoed between two poles
Fetched back to the house
Cut loose in a fenced field
For sport for that day
Lost to me every day since 
I bring it back steady
Its shine against this time•
Where I am told one past
Counts most all others
Must be put down to what
That alligator jaws open
Head reared presents
Ready to lash with tail
Charge at anyone
Who takes it for a log •
X marks the spot where
Englishman walks in half
Circles pumps his bent
Arms as if to fly cackles
Like a peacock only to get
The real thing started
The two in a quarrel thrice
Removed from that magic
Flower duet from Lakmé
By Léo Delibes  Peacock
Donkey caiman village fool
Be my ally bring it all
Cow moon dish spoon •
Yo-Yo Ma follows Eek
On democracy’s Shuffle Play •
Zebra asks me in Queen’s
English peppered with Esperanto
If he be black whiff white stripes
Or white wid black stripes 
I wake with this atonal pair
On the edge of my edginess
“I do not care I do not care
If the Don has on underwear ”“But don’t you think or worry some
That his nudity is zero sum”
“I cannot see for the life of me
Why that should concern anybody ”“I fret when all’s said and done
We leave him be he has his fun ”
