
My husband doesn’t believe me that the dogs barked nightly
at the spirit in the corner of the kitchen  That I knew of a family
whose quilts were flung against the wall mid-sleep  Once I told him
I met Satan in Scandinavia and she had pigtails and a machete
sticky with spiderwort  She couldn’t have been older than six
or seven  Her ancestors were Vikings  They boiled firestarters in urine
and when she approached me she laughed and called me ugly
three times stygg stygg stygg  With the same gurgle of the growling
dogs  With a film over her eyes bobbled back into her head  Then
she giggled and ran away  Later in the hotel room I anointed
my forehead with oil right thumb tracing the Sign of the Cross
howling in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit
amen
