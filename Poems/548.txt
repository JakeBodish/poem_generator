
This is the silence around the poem of the death of my father 
This is the silence before the poem 
 
While my father was dying the Challenger was exploding on TV
Again and again  I watched it happen  In his hospital room
I followed his breath  Then it stopped 
 
This is the silence in a poem about the dying of the father 
 
 
We’re burning the earth  We’re burning the sky 
 
Here is another silence in the middle of the poem about the immolation of the Fathers 
 
The pyres of bodies in Saigon 
The burned air
The charred limbs 
Ash 
Rancid flames 
Heat
Light
Fire
 
                                  We turn away 
 
Here is another silence within the poem about the burial of the fire 
 
When my father died the rains poured down the moment I picked up the shovel of earth 
I staggered under the weight of the water 
 
Another silence please 
 
 
I have always wanted to be a woman of fire 
I will have to learn how to rain 
Gently I will learn how to rain 
 
I have set fire to your green fields
May I be water to your burning lands 
 
Please join me in this last silence at the end of the poem of fire
