
Women want to save you or want you to savage them 
Men want to see what is under your towel 
The dollar bills they throw into your cage
are all you need to care about because
you aren’t dancing in a cage to entertain them 
 
You dance in a cage to make money  I open
my towel to the right then whip it back toward midline
just as I open to the left I show them nothing 
But I have them convinced I will show them something 
There is a difference between men and women 
 
you must look women in the eyes and if possible
look hurt with men you must avoid looking
at them altogether you must focus on moving your hips
which is close to what they are actually watching 
Suspended in a cage above the far end
 
of the dance floor I was not attainable I
made myself seem attainable  These are just the basics 
Wearing nothing but a towel my greyish wings
extended to full wingspan my chest shaved 
the clubbers believe I am wearing a costume 
 
It is amazing what people believe  The music
is cheaper than a Budweiser  The air is smoke and
the smell of smoke mixed with sweat and your job
is to convince each of them you are dancing for no one else 
When my shift is over and I pull on some jeans
 
tuck my wings and bandage them down pull on two shirts
I can almost pretend I never entered that cage in the first place 
Outside on Lansdowne Street there are people standing
in one line or another waiting to get in to clubs 
Night after night the same thing the waiting never ends
