
My cousin Milton worked for a cable company 
The boy I knew when we were children
 
had fists that were often clenched his face set like
an old man whose life had been so hard
 
it hardened him  But the mans hands opened to let
more of the world in  He sent the funniest
 
cards to family and friends at Christmas laid down
cable so others could connect  Yet he lived
 
alone kept to himself much of the time so when
his sister found his body hed been gone
 
a good while  He died young at fifty-seven without
fuss or bother  No sitting by the bedside
 
or feeding him soup  He just laid himself down like
a trunk line and let the signal pass through
