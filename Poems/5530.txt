
To perform death is something only humans would doNo animal would sit thereWith a blank look on its faceJust because the camera is thereNo no an animal would look directly in itOr cover its face like the overweightWoman in the picture in the magazineBy the room where I keep my bedWhat people don’t understand about beautyIs that after all it is not fleetingAfter all it is so gross to be that wayThat someone sees among youAfter all to call into questionI painted my lips my eyesOnly our scholars know thatTo perform is to be malleableTo perform in languageOr was itThe large purple insect I let in the roomOr was it the furred face   the hippo or the gorgeThat I was the devil in the woodIn my own bones that I knew the faceThat I took that faceWas it midnight blue skyNo were my wings iridescentEven in these linesThe voice moves youWhat sense of exquisite causeThought Moves you past these linesInto conversation With the undeadI don’t knowThat is somethingYou will have to answer for yourselfI came back to this place to help youAnd that I didShoot sparks of green and grayThrough timeWhat skin sackI put myself  inI mean for what whyOr whoDid I manage to do this for if not youLilaced thingThe soft rustle of  beetle wingsIn air that is warm and grayAnd is not strongBut there is there to carry us past it
