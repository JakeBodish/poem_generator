
I was wondering why that guy
wore the blanket coat bone choker rock
watch woven buckle quilled Stetson 
I was wondering why he wore
that beaded vest like a ledger drawing
or a Winter Count its skinny figure
forever sneaking after two bison
around belly to back
around back to belly 
I was wondering why when he saidI wear these getups every day Every day because these thingsare sacred these things are prayer 
Then I knew I could live this life
If I had blue horses
painted around and around me
shells and beads like rain in my ear
praying Prairie open in me
at stoplight hard city last call bank line
coffee break shopping cart keycodePrarie open in mePrarie open in me
every day every day every day
