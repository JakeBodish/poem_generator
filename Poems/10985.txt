
Though half my years besiege the aged sun     I have not lived  My robust preparation     Lags tardily behind fit consummationDroops sweatily in courses just begun Oh I have loved and lusted with the best     Plucked momentary music from the senses     I’ve kissed a lip or two with fair pretensesAnd wept for softness of a woman’s breast My mind rebounds to nether joys and pain     Toying with filth and pharisaic leaven     I know the lift up sundry peaks to heavenAnd every rockless path to hell again I wait the hour when gods have more to giveThan husks and bare insatiate will to live
