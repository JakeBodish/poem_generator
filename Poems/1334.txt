
Our fathers did but use the world beforeAnd having used did leave the same to us We spill whatever resteth to their store What can our heirs inherit but our curseFor we have sucked the sweet and sap awayAnd sowed consumption in the fruitful groundThe woods and forests clad in rich arrayWith nakedness and baldness we confound We have defaced the lasting monumentsAnd caused all honour to have end with usThe holy temples feel our ravishments What can our heirs inherit but our curseThe world must end for men are so accurstUnless God end it sooner they will first
