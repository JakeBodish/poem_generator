
THE FLESH Sweet thou art pale 
     More pale to seeChrist hung upon the cruel treeAnd bore His Fathers wrath for me Sweet thou art sad 
     Beneath a rodMore heavy Christ for my sake trodThe winepress of the wrath of God Sweet thou art weary 
     Not so ChristWhose mighty love of me sufficdFor Strength Salvation Eucharist Sweet thou art footsore 
     If I bleedHis feet have bled yea in my needHis Heart once bled for mine indeed THE WORLD Sweet thou art young 
     So He was youngWho for my sake in silence hungUpon the Cross with Passion wrung Look thou art fair 
     He was more fairThan men Who deignd for me to wearA visage marrd beyond compare And thou hast riches 
     Daily breadAll else is His Who living deadFor me lackd where to lay His Head And life is sweet 
     It was not soTo Him Whose Cup did overflowWith mine unutterable woe THE DEVIL Thou drinkest deep 
     When Christ would supHe draind the dregs from out my cupSo how should I be lifted upThou shalt win Glory 
     In the skiesLord Jesus cover up mine eyesLest they should look on vanities Thou shalt have Knowledge 
     Helpless dustIn Thee O Lord I put my trustAnswer Thou for me Wise and Just And Might  
     Get thee behind me  LordWho hast redeemd and not abhorrdMy soul oh keep it by Thy Word
