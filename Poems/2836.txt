
The woman with the microphone sings to hurt you
To see you shake your head  The mic may as well
Be a leather belt  You drive to the center of town
To be whipped by a womans voice  You cant tell
The difference between a leather belt and a lovers
Tongue  A lovers tongue might call you bitch
A term of endearment where you come from a kind
Of compliment preceded by the word singIn certain nightclubs  A lush little tongueYou have you can yell Sing bitch and I love youWith a shot of Patrón at the end of each phraseFrom the same barstool every Saturday night but you cantRemember your fathers leather belt without shakingYour head  Thats what satisfies her the womanWith the microphone  She does not mean to entertainYou and neither do I  Speak to me in a lovers tongue  Call me your bitch and Ill sing the whole night long
