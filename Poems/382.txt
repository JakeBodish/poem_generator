
Dawn marks the wall
 
a thin flange of
off-blue
 
An imagined
silence
 
Always an imagined
silence
 
The speed
at which sleep’s
fogged dialogue withers
 
into the present
noun-scape
 
This rift valley
 
A volley of
seasonal beacons
 
Window
where mind
 
finds orbit
 
     
 
All a world can do
is appear
 
The window
intones
 
A room
whose walls
 
warp with sun
 
What’s seen
is dreamed
 
We think
ourselves here
