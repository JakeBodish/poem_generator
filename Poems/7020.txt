
Come live with me and be my love And we will some new pleasures prove Of golden sands and crystal brooks With silken lines and silver hooks  There will the river whispering run Warmd by thy eyes more than the sun And there the enamourd fish will stay Begging themselves they may betray  When thou wilt swim in that live bath Each fish which every channel hath Will amorously to thee swim Gladder to catch thee than thou him  If thou to be so seen best loth By sun or moon thou darknest both And if myself have leave to see I need not their light having thee  Let others freeze with angling reeds And cut their legs with shells and weeds Or treacherously poor fish beset With strangling snare or windowy net  Let coarse bold hands from slimy nest The bedded fish in banks out-wrest Or curious traitors sleeve-silk flies Bewitch poor fishes wandring eyes  For thee thou needst no such deceit For thou thyself art thine own bait That fish that is not catchd thereby Alas is wiser far than I
