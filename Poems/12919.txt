
Devouring Time blunt thou the lions paws
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws
And burn the long-livd Phoenix in her blood
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets
And do whateer thou wilt swift-footed Time
To the wide world and all her fading sweets
But I forbid thee one more heinous crime
O carve not with the hours my loves fair brow
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
Him in thy course untainted do allow
For beautys pattern to succeeding men 
Yet do thy worst old Time Despite thy wrong
My love shall in my verse ever live young
