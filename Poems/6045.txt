
It was the week of asking  Asking
to watch her eat  Asking if she understood
the doctors’ questions  Asking her
to explain the difference between
wanting to die right now and dying later 
The tumor making certain answers
unquestionable  I watched her point
to the incense dish from which
someone swept all the ashes up  Asking
if she recognized us  Because that
is what the living want thinking
it is a sign we have been loved 
But the answer was a summer drive
a mountain piles of leaves beneath which
a wolf slept suckling her cubs 
Some deaths are good
and it makes them hard to grieve 
She was at times in great pain  We wanted her
to die too  That was important  But first
we wanted her to remember 
From the bed a finger pressed
into a pile of leaves  Gray haunch
unmovable ashes  I didn’t want to disturb
their tableau
