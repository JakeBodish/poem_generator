
Not in thy body is thy life at all
     But in this ladys lips and hands and eyes
     Through these she yields thee life that vivifiesWhat else were sorrows servant and deaths thrall Look on thyself without her and recall
     The waste remembrance and forlorn surmise
     That livd but in a dead-drawn breath of sighsOer vanishd hours and hours eventual Even so much life hath the poor tress of hair
     Which stord apart is all love hath to show
     For heart-beats and for fire-heats long agoEven so much life endures unknown even where
     Mid change the changeless night environeth
     Lies all that golden hair undimmd in death
