
I wait for you to come
to brush your shoe against
the blade of grass Im sitting on
touch me with your hand
as you reach for one last
violet to take home
 
or pick up a worm to place
gracefully in the garden
 
even better if you lie
on a hillside to watch the sunset
or breathe in stars
 
I will feel your warmth bury
my head next to that freckle
on your calf that hair
on your forearm or just behind
the lobe of your left ear
 
I promise not to take too much
blood into my swelling body
 
only what I think I need
 
and I will never
let you know I am here
though I will love you
 
deeply
