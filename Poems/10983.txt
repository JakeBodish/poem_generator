
Pour O pour that parting soul in songO pour it in the sawdust glow of nightInto the velvet pine-smoke air tonightAnd let the valley carry it along And let the valley carry it along  O land and soil red soil and sweet-gum treeSo scant of grass so profligate of pinesNow just before an epoch’s sun declines Thy son in time I have returned to thee Thy son I have in time returned to thee In time for though the sun is setting onA song-lit race of slaves it has not setThough late O soil it is not too late yetTo catch thy plaintive soul leaving soon goneLeaving to catch thy plaintive soul soon gone  O Negro slaves dark purple ripened plumsSqueezed and bursting in the pine-wood airPassing before they stripped the old tree bareOne plum was saved for me one seed becomesAn everlasting song a singing treeCaroling softly souls of slaveryWhat they were and what they are to meCaroling softly souls of slavery
