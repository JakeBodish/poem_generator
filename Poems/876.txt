
I have a rendezvous with DeathAt some disputed barricadeWhen Spring comes back with rustling shadeAnd apple-blossoms fill the air I have a rendezvous with DeathWhen Spring brings back blue days and fair It may be he shall take my handAnd lead me into his dark landAnd close my eyes and quench my breath It may be I shall pass him still I have a rendezvous with DeathOn some scarred slope of battered hillWhen Spring comes round again this yearAnd the first meadow-flowers appear God knows twere better to be deepPillowed in silk and scented downWhere Love throbs out in blissful sleepPulse nigh to pulse and breath to breathWhere hushed awakenings are dear    But Ive a rendezvous with DeathAt midnight in some flaming townWhen Spring trips north again this yearAnd I to my pledged word am trueI shall not fail that rendezvous
