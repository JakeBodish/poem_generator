
A mother possum crawled down the chimney
the spring Donny came to us
because both sets of his parents had kicked him out
the same April after your dad and I divorced
when you kicked a hole in the dining room wall 
The possum was swollen with young
she would later carry half-grown on her back
or hanging from her thick hairless tail 
“An oversized rat with maternal instincts”
your dad once said 
 
Instead of one angry son I now had two–
fifteen and seventeen–
two forged signatures on absence excuses
two discipline committee meetings
two conferences with the principal 
While I worked
you shared contraband beer
as well as the basement bedroom
with its fieldstone fireplace
in which you found the possum one cool evening 
 
Laughing and cheering you teamed up
to cage her with a trash can
carry her to the alley out back and dump her 
The possum squeezed back
down the chimney twice more  The third time
you threw her out on Troost Avenue screaming
for a car to smash her beneath its tires 
She must have been near her time
desperate for a nest
to crawl back down after that 
The noise woke me after midnight 
Donny had clubbed her with his nunchuks 
You both kicked and stomped
her head as she lurched stumbled
between your feet 
Halfway down
the basement steps I stopped
seeing your faces  The possum fell
limp  I backed slowly up the stairs 
 
In the morning you couldn’t meet my eyes 
I just made you clean up the mess
