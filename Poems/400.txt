
I’m terrified of a number of fates
Poisoned water under a tyrant’s wage
Being fired for doing nothing my parents dying
Committing a thought like this to the page
The splash of acid to the face
The Queens non-profit boss received
Leaving work one blue August evening  Hell’s
So eloquent and poetry’s no fate at all
Unless you count the story of the divided sea
Waiting to wash its assassins away 
Says the Pharaoh “That’s so sad ”
But that story is less fate than news whereas
That Queens boss Permanently burned the Times
Says one eye won’t stop weeping
