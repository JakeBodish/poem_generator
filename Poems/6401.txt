
Oh I said this is going to be 
And it was 
Oh I said this will never happen 
But it did 
And a purple fog descended upon the land 
The roots of trees curled up 
The world was divided into two countries 
Every photograph taken in the first was of people 
Every photograph taken in the second showed none 
All of the girl children were named And 
All of the boy children named Then
