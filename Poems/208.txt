
We dressed for church   I had a white hat
and white gloves when I was fifteen no joke 
You had to do that to show God you cared 
 
Gods eyes were stained glass and his voice
was pipe organ  He was immortal invisible
while my panty-hose itched and my atheist
 
father chewed his tongue and threatened to run
out the door but didnt for my mothers sake
and she swallowed her fate this marriage
 
like a communion cracker and my brain-
damaged brother lurched around the church
nursery and my sweeter sister watched me
 
with huge brown eyes to see what Id do next 
My God why did I turn my eyes upward when
we were all there then in the flesh I am so
 
sorry about God sorry we fastened that word
to the sky  Gods not even legal in Hebrew 
If you get the vowel caught between the two
 
consonants of your lips it can carry you
dangerously up like a balloon over what youd
give anything to be in the middle of now
