
How many paltry foolish painted thingsThat now in coaches trouble every streetShall be forgotten whom no poet singsEre they be well wrappd in their winding-sheetWhere I to thee eternity shall giveWhen nothing else remaineth of these daysAnd queens hereafter shall be glad to liveUpon the alms of thy superfluous praise Virgins and matrons reading these my rhymesShall be so much delighted with thy storyThat they shall grieve they livd not in these timesTo have seen thee their sexs only glory So shalt thou fly above the vulgar throngStill to survive in my immortal song
