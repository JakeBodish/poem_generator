
I went out at night alone The young blood flowing beyond the seaSeemed to have drenched my spirit’s wings  I bore my sorrow heavily But when I lifted up my head From shadows shaken on the snowI saw Orion in the east Burn steadily as long ago From windows in my father’s house Dreaming my dreams on winter nightsI watched Orion as a girl Above another city’s lights Years go dreams go and youth goes too The world’s heart breaks beneath its warsAll things are changed save in the east The faithful beauty of the stars
