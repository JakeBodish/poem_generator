
Gone gone againMay June JulyAnd August goneAgain gone byNot memorableSave that I saw them goAs past the empty quaysThe rivers flow And now againIn the harvest rainThe Blenheim orangesFall grubby from the treesAs when I was young And when the lost one was here And when the war beganTo turn young men to dung Look at the old houseOutmoded dignifiedDark and untenantedWith grass growing insteadOf the footsteps of lifeThe friendliness the strifeIn its beds have lainYouth love age and painI am something like thatOnly I am not deadStill breathing and interestedIn the house that is not dark I am something like thatNot one pane to reflect the sunFor the schoolboys to throw at They have broken every one
