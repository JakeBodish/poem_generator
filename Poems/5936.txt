We were not green in judgment or coldin blood like Cleopatra in her youthwho still was ordering chopped radishin her bowls back thenthe hearts all gone to piecesnext to the winter greensthat in our days we never had use forso smitten were we with fireand ovens that I was gravy in judgmentwhich might not mean muchunless you’ve taken a spoonof it and poured it back over a dumplingshaped like your heartso that it became even softersomething you could not have thought possible It’s all happening nowyou liked to say and I agreedthough it was not the newsfrom the outside I relishedbut the daily Extra Extra the lightof the morning brought to my attentionevery time we woke in your houseor my house and my heart  salty risen   was warmagain in a way it hadn’t been for years Organ of passion organ of righteousnessthat has never had a single flavor cross its lipshow could you knowhow much I would miss the honey of those daysher drizzle of it on the turkey baconmy cracking pepper up and down the panthe sweet meat of happiness I would no longer let pass between our teeth
