
He can’t stop putting the dead
flowers the deadhead nails the deadweight
sacks of flour in his mouth  He can’t
stop writing about the mouth  The way
he woke up to his mouth full of bees
their dead crunch still stinging
his gums  He writes There’s something
beautiful in the way a mouth can be broken
by saliva and cold air
