
Even before I saw the chambered nautilus
I wanted to sail not in the us navy
Tonight Im waiting for you your letter
At the same time his letter the view of you
By him and then by me in the park no rhymes
I saw you this is in prose no its not
Sitting with the molluscs  anemones in an
Empty autumn enterprise baby you look pretty
With your long eventual hair is love king
Whats this A sonnet Loves a babe we know that
Im coming up Im coming Shakespeare only stuck
To one subject but Ill mention nobody said
You have to get young Americans some ice cream
In the artificial light in which she woke
