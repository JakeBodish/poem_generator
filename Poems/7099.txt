
What is thy thought of meWhat is thy feelingLovst thou the veil of senseOr its revealingLeavst thou the maiden roseDrooping and blushingOr rendst its bosom withKissing and crushingI would be beautifulThat thou shouldst woo meGentle delightsome butTo draw thee to me Yet should thy longing eyeEver caress meAnd quickened FantasyOnly possess meThus thy hearts highest needLong would I cherishLest its more trivial wishPall and then perish Would that Loves fond pursuitWere crownèd neverOr that his virgin kissLasted for ever
