
I have a brief confession
that I would like to make 
If I dont get it off my chest
Im sure my heart will break 
I didnt do my reading 
I watched TV instead 
while munching cookies cakes and chips
and cinnamon raisin bread 
I didnt wash the dishes 
I didnt clean the mess 
Now there are roaches eating crumbs 
a million more or less 
I didnt turn the TV off 
I didnt shut the light 
Just think of all the energy
I wasted through the night 
I feel so very guilty 
I did a lousy job 
I hope my students dont find out
that I am such a slob
