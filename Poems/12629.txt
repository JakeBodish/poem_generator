    But Wretched Child how canst thou thus requiteThy Aged Parents for that great delightThey took in thee when thou as helpless layIn their Indulgent Bosoms day by dayThy Mother long before she brought thee forthTook care thou shouldst want neither Food nor Cloth Thy Father glad was at his very heartHad he to thee a Portion to impart Comfort they promised themselves in theeBut thou it seems to them a Grief wilt be How oft How willingly brake they their SleepIf thou their Bantling didst but whinch or weep Their Love to thee was such they could have givnThat thou mightst live almost their part of Heavn 
    But now behold how they rewarded areFor their Indulgent Love and tender CareAll is forgot this Love he doth despiseThey brought this Bird up to pick out their Eyes
