The tiny journalist
will tell us what she sees 
 
Document the moves the dust
soldiers blocking the road 
 
Yes she knows how to take a picture
with her phone  Holds it high
 
like a balloon  Yes she would
prefer to dance and play
 
would prefer the world
to be pink  It is her job to say
 
what she sees what is happening 
From her vantage point everything
 
is huge but don’t look down on her 
She’s bigger than you are 
 
If you stomp her garden
each leaf expands its view 
 
Don’t hide what you do 
She sees you at 2 a m  adjusting your
 
impenetrable vest 
What could she have
 
that you want Her treasures
thing shiny buttons her grandmother loved 
 
Her cousin her uncle There might have been a shirt     
 
The tiny journalist notices
action on far away roads
 
farther even than the next village 
She takes counsel from bugs so
 
puffs of dust find her first Could that be a friend 
 They pretended not to see us They came at night with weapons  
 What was our crime That we likedrespect as they do That we have pride 
 
She stares through a hole in the fence
barricade of words and wire
 
feels the rising fire
before anyone strikes a match 
 
She has a better idea
