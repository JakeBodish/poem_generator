  Dante “The Divine Comedy”

As above so below as below so above 
  Three Initiates “The Kybalion”



A Lowcountry marsh trembles with the blood of an African
Who refused to climb out of the salt and mud of the bay
And quite literally lost his head  A hunter named Hunter
Waits for the man’s wounds to close and for him to rise
Again  Some call this festive cruelty Paradise  Pleasure 
Demby the African made to rise and suffer another shot
Calls it the Afterlife the unceasing blind world of death
He welcomed expecting the end to his captivity and exile 
But there is no end to the perfecting of cruelty even now
In the Afterlife where a hawk humped up in the high weeds
And a house on fire are a congruent sadness a brief history
Of nature’s one duty for flesh   decay decay decay     
Sometimes it is as if every bird in the Afterlife trills this
One song  And I forget who I am but then I look down
At my feet shuffling in darkness and hear my name   
Till     Till     Till     And I know I am no farmer blade
Or mule driven over some roach-ragged road to field
And fray and sometimes I forget how I came here to After-
Life to pleasure to domestic violence to drive be
Driven and then I look down at my hands  It is a war
That brought you this peace a war that brought you this peace 
And then I heard a question “Shall we kill all of the masters”
And before I brokered an answer I heard a voice say
“Then we must kill ourselves first  And who will
Be left to kill the masters” I turned to find nothing
But a boy in a tree and a girl beside him their heads
Tolling in the wind like pecker-fretted fruit  Voice I said
Come now or do not come at all  And there a man
I had seen before scratching in dust next to a drill field
With a dictionary and a strange astronomy for a face 
Ezra is that you I asked  “The peasants’ bent shoulders
Odysseus and the dead bullock   call me whatever you’d like 
I come to every name like a white ox toward Pisa
And the butcher’s road  I come to Paradise dragged
By the hair     with one day’s reading and surrendered
Temple ” You do talk funny I said  “He do the police
In different voices” he said  And when all the voices
sound like the police I said kill all the voices  And so ran 
I ran from Ezra who ran after me and demanded he be
My guide  “There is no running from the forest of men 
There is no running from men ” I’ll be damned I said   
But before I could finish Ezra said “That’s right  Be damned 
Be here taloned and tumbling the sky down in Paradise 
Here  Be in your cage and free ” But here is not the here
I seek nor sought  For that here harangues me
And I might as well be the nigger coming over
The obstacle fence a periplum of certain disaster
A choir of empty cups sitting loudly before the famished
Your prince dear Ezra hanging by his heels in the piazza
The sprezzatura of maggots rummaging the round heart
For its divinity and pulse  Ezra nothing of you but the dead 
And so I ran past the possum running through the skull
Holes of a dead man lying in the fog that licked them
Into a wet testimony the possum testifying too to their death   
Coming going in ruins and floating out out beyond
Their murders and dropped plates out beyond the Thame-ish
Rivers and its drowning traditions  And then I looked back
And saw Ezra  He had come to his cage and could go no farther 
“Till” he said  “Bring me up from beneath these decks
One slaver to another ” He winked and I winked back
Handed him the katydid buzzing in my pocket as I had done
Before dug a trench around him as another had done before
Then said “Ezra be here in your cage and free” and ran 
And then I came upon a mountain and then a chasm
For which there was no bridge and so turned back
To find a possum running behind me and I asked him
Dear Possum what do we do with this darkness
Between us and the possum said nothing and ran on
Into the darkness into the chasm and fell speaking of
The end of touch the desire to forget desire shadows
The fear in a handful of dust a woman’s mouth
Fear I had known of and visited though now I cringed
At the thought of that violence the violence that I brought   
And so thought to throw myself too in that chasm
When a hand touched my shoulder a voice said “Not now
Maybe never  On we go dear boy through this weather 
Let’s find us another theory of light  Or darkness ”
Then she laughed for it was a woman with a lit darkness
And a careful chin glasses her body a tin of tender 
What do you know of me I asked  She said “Louis
I know of you as I know fog   that it comes on
Through the alleys and past the dead boys and girls
Who had not wanted to die in those alleys and ornament
The city’s sight  Louis” she said  “I’ve known all your light 
But do you know mine” And I hadn’t I hadn’t 
“I was a taken city burning” she said “a burning house
Built to heal the sick a sick house full of healing
The owl moccasin and panther   a rising
For which there has never been such risen the total
Black  I is the total black  Flame and fox and knot
Of the what-nots you would have forgotten if not for me
I am perfect fucking memory no-dominion-defied
The god-head-glitter-gussied-up-for-the-going-down ”
And though I thought I saw I had not seen  Instead
Of one body three  Women  And who and who and who
I asked  They laughed at my asking and said “You
Wouldn’t know us but we will tell you our names   
Mother Song and Holy Yoke  Audre Gwendolyn
And Lucille  Follow us  Or heel ” And where
And where should I follow you They did not answer
Instead they walked on the edge of the abyss
Laughing as if the abyss  “We are what is whatnot
The ever shimmying out of the never-wound 
Louis do you follow or do you fall”
They said  “Are you short or is you tall”
And on and on they played pleasured and pigeoned
With each other kiting sound and word between them
As I have seen lovers do passing cigarettes and smoke
From one mouth to another the smoke the shared body
Of a God that has no master or mastering plan
Other than abiding in darkness abiding in both
Its coronation and crucifixion  On and on we walked 
And I followed  Beyond the bears chortling pears
From Augustine’s outstretched hand out beyond the river
Scissoring the changing maple its leaves ambering
Then auburn then green each time a child appeared
And touched its trunk  We stopped watched  I asked
Who are they  And the one full of light and knives answered
Waving at a few who journeyed to the edge of the water
But did not wade in  And why don’t they wade in
I asked  She snickered quieted then said
“Wind and foxes what was never mine but was and was ”
As if she knew I did not understand continued “‘The ones
I got but did not get’ the wild hair they could not grow
But scratches me now as it did once in a dream 
Our abortions Louis our ones given and gave  Dem 
The ones given all of their years at once  And none
Or never ” And when she spoke I saw another come
To the shore and wave at me a boy given and gave the crushed-
Color of late evening long after the pickers have come
In and settled near a pot of ox bones boiling in the evening
Of their own water once again predicting the arch
And strange astronomy of the flesh and its march march
March to October and the battered soil  I mean I turned
From the one waving because I could not be beneath
The stairs of his steering and stare  Paradise
Why do you bring me to such weather Why
Would any man come down from his noose for this
“Because coming down is exactly the point 
All heavens lesser and below heaven  Noose not        
You came to see what has become of death        ”
The women spoke as one who had many tongues  
All Holy Ghost and gut of a river gabbling over the white
Stones  And where are we going I asked 
“Where language begins Till 
                                              Paradise  But over there ”

                 And wasn’t this paradise that I had entered
Through the thick marsh waters out of the cane
                         The crowds fleeced of their living flesh at the far bank
                 The intubated children with their gas masks
                         Hanging from their hands and wandering
      The sand in wet hospital gowns in this their new cancer
                 Wasn’t this paradise
                        A boy headphoned and heart drunk
          Swaying at the back of the crowd mumbling to himself                        Started from the bottom now we’re here
     Started from the bottom now my whole team is fucking here
