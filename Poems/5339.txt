diving board thwokingand leaving never arrived      Cut it outmy mother said     my brother clowning around with a water gun     Cut it out The planes arrowed into silence fourteenfifteen sixteen always coming home from summer     over the bridge to Brooklyn The father stabbed on Orange Streetthe Betamax in the trash the Sasha doll the dog chewed up hollow plastic arms gaping  Powdered pink lemonade tonguing the sweet grains                                                        liquid-thick  I could stand in that self   for yearswondering is it better to anticipate than to age     Imagining children with five different mena great flood that would destroy your possessions     and free you to wander  Bathing suits and apples and suntan oiland a mother bending over youshadow of   her face on yours  It’s gonethat way the breeze the permanent pool A father saying “ghost” and the sheetsslipping off   the oak tree’s bough When I wake leaves in the water  You could say greenforever and not be lying  2 The pond near the house in Mainewhere we lived for one year to “get away” from the city     the pondwhere the skaters     on Saturdays camered scarves     through white snowvoices drawing near and     pullingaway trees against the clouds  Trying to liveoff   the land for a while  Too hardin the end my father said      What did he say Forget it     you weren’t listening     He worefishing overalls most days and stank of   guts Our shouts slipping the green garbage cansedging the white scar pondso many days like secrets about to bedivulged                                               White snowto stink of   fish guts but     to be tryingto live               the pond near the houseand the sound of   voices     drawing near As you aged you got distracted indebted  In the hospital around my motherthe machines     beepedthe long leads of   the heart monitordrooping parabolas  It’s not worth dying for     she said  Whatwas it she meant Swollen shells the desiccated brown seedpods we used to pinch onto our noses and skate about     putting on airs  Then the books openedtheir pages and with our red woolenscarves flying and the Freezy Freakies’ once-invisible hearts reddening into the cold we disappeared  Evian bottles skitter against the chain-link fence It’s gone     that way     the green planes arrowing into silence     gum wrappersslipping to the ground O wild West Wind     be thou our friend and blow away the trash  Salvage us from     the heap of our making andCut it out my mother said     Stop worryingabout the future it doesn’tbelong to us and we don’t belong to it 3 The surface more slippery slickand white the ice  I stand at the pond’s edge gather the information     darkening there hello algae     hello fish pond my mind in the depths     going  On the beach I dig tunnel to the hands of   the woman who stitched this red shirt     holes all the way to China It got so easy to     get used to it the orchestration of meaning against the night life a tower you could climb onnot a junk heap     pale picture booksyellowing on the shelves  It got so     I close my eyes and walk along the hospital hall The iris quivering in the March lighta nurse taking my mother’s pulsenot paid enough to help us as we wished to be helped  And your hope left behind     turning the pages of   magazines the models in Prada  As a girlit was a quest to feel exploded every secondpudding pops     and Vietnam vets standing on the corner shaking their Styrofoamcups      Holding her cup my mother stands petting the dogit’s 1982     the sun tunneling in     she drinks her coffeeCut it out or     Forget it or     Hello  Look I’ve made a telephone for us Put that cup to your ear and I’ll put it to mineand listen     I just need to findone of those Styrofoam cups and what about you     where did yougo what kind of night is it there electric synthetic blackened or burnt 4 At night they come to youdistorted and bright like an old print on a light box present     present          not quite  Are we inventing them as we sleep or are they still     happeningin a time we can’t touchThe hockey game on the bluetv glowing and slowing     I come home to a man slumped on the couch not-quite-sayinga greeting     all the gone ones there the slap of skates     all goneand the commentator it’s going on foreverthe blade moving along rinksays What a slapshot what a shot You make a life it is made of days anddays ordinary and subvocal not busy becoming what they could be               dark furlings of tiny church feelings mysterious I meanand intricate like that high-windowed light  intricate and mysterious          I come home  Near our house we hung out on the Promenade after school the boys smokingthe security systems in the Center blinking     a disco party blue red  blue red the East Riverreflecting scraped sky     cornices and cloudswe could hear the roar of cars across it and taste the chemical airof   the offices the

subwaysflirting the boys     grabbing us calling     hey     hey Changeable one day to the next Jon talking of atheismblond hair in strips          At night the bomb mushroomingover the Statue of   Liberty white blinding everywhere           Oh she said don’t worryjust a dream          just a dream Everyone is scared of   Russia  Imagine          she laughed     We used to have to hide under our
