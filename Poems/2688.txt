
First are you our sort of a person
Do you wear
A glass eye false teeth or a crutch
A brace or a hook
Rubber breasts or a rubber crotch
Stitches to show somethings missing No no Then
How can we give you a thing
Stop crying 
Open your hand 
Empty Empty  Here is a hand
To fill it and willing
To bring teacups and roll away headaches
And do whatever you tell it 
Will you marry it
It is guaranteed
To thumb shut your eyes at the end
And dissolve of sorrow 
We make new stock from the salt 
I notice you are stark naked 
How about this suit  
Black and stiff but not a bad fit 
Will you marry it
It is waterproof shatterproof proof
Against fire and bombs through the roof 
Believe me theyll bury you in it 
Now your head excuse me is empty 
I have the ticket for that 
Come here sweetie out of the closet 
Well what do you think of that
Naked as paper to start
But in twenty-five years shell be silver
In fifty gold 
A living doll everywhere you look 
It can sew it can cook
It can talk talk talk 
It works there is nothing wrong with it 
You have a hole its a poultice 
You have an eye its an image 
My boy its your last resort 
Will you marry it marry it marry it
