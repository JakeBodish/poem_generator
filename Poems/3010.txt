
A chimney breathing a little smoke 
The sun I cant see
making a bit of pink
I cant quite see in the blue 
The pink of five tulips
at five p m  on the day before March first 
The green of the tulip stems and leaves
like something I cant remember
finding a jack-in-the-pulpit
a long time ago and far away 
Why it was December then
and the sun was on the sea
by the temples wed gone to see 
One green wave moved in the violet sea
like the UN Building on big evenings
green and wet
while the sky turns violet 
A few almond trees
had a few flowers like a few snowflakes
out of the blue looking pink in the light 
A gray hush
in which the boxy trucks roll up Second Avenue
into the sky  Theyre just
going over the hill 
The green leaves of the tulips on my desk
like grass light on flesh
and a green-copper steeple
and streaks of cloud beginning to glow 
I cant get over
how it all works in together
like a woman who just came to her window
and stands there filling it
jogging her baby in her arms 
Shes so far off  Is it the light
that makes the baby pink
I can see the little fists
and the rocking-horse motion of her breasts 
Its getting grayer and gold and chilly 
Two dog-size lions face each other
at the corners of a roof 
Its the yellow dust inside the tulips 
Its the shape of a tulip 
Its the water in the drinking glass the tulips are in 
Its a day like any other
