
The whole countryin a courtly danceits tiny mouth openI pour another cup of wineand falling risingthe children remove their toysaround the small apartmentto their bunk bedsnot quite dark yetearly spring with snowon the windthe woman across the streetbent like a sicklecollecting bottles and cansknocks goes onI wonder where she livesand the stars shiningon her greasy clothes
