
Anything can be a bird if you’re not careful 
I should say something nice about the weather 
I should be in awe of the living but the world dulls
when I step into it  The squirrels scatter the branches
lift  Sure I’ve hurt the ones I’ve loved
by not paying attention  Not alone   never alone
is a lesson I need to understand  It was you who said that 
It’s you still  You who says Look You who points
to the sky  You who tilts my chin toward the heron
who cups the minnow in your hands
who spots the deer miles ahead who dulls
the world with your absence  You who says Look
 when I look you are gone replaced
by the whitetail’s hind legs fading into the bush
