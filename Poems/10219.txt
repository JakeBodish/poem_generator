
I have just returned from a visit to my pier
Often I am permitted to return to my pier
For a long time I would go to pier early
So much depends upon a pier
This is an old pier
I celebrate my pier and what I assume      
I had a pier
There is a certain slant of pier
On womans first disobedience and the pier
Christmas wont be Christmas without the pier
I wandered lonely as a pier
Pier was spiteful
This is just to say I have eaten the pier
