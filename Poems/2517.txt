
To these I turn in these I trust Brother Lead and Sister Steel To his blind power I make appealI guard her beauty clean from rust He spins and burns and loves the airAnd splits a skull to win my praiseBut up the nobly marching daysShe glitters naked cold and fair Sweet Sister grant your soldier thisThat in good fury he may feelThe body where he sets his heelQuail from your downward darting kiss
