At least it helps me to think about my son
a Leoborn to us
Aries and Cancer some
sixteen years ago
in St  John’s Hospital next to the Long Island
Railroad tracks
Atlantic AvenueBrooklyn
New York
at dawn
which facts
do not really prepare you
do they
for him
angry
serious
and running through the darkness with his own
becoming light
