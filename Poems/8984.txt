
He danced with tall grass
for a moment like he was swaying
with a woman  Our gun barrels
glowed white-hot 
When I got to him
a blue halo
of flies had already claimed him 
I pulled the crumbled photograph
from his fingers 
Theres no other way
to say this I fell in love 
The morning cleared again
except for a distant mortar
 somewhere choppers taking off 
I slid the wallet into his pocket
 turned him over so he wouldnt be
kissing the ground
