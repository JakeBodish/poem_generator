
When I push your button
you fly off the handle
old skin and bones
black bat wing 
Were alike you and I 
Both of us
resemble my mother
so fierce in her advocacy
on behalf of
the most vulnerable child
wholl catch his death
in this tempest 
Such a headwind
Sometimes it requires
all my strength
just to end a line 
But when the wind is at
my back were likely
to get carried away and say
something we can never retract
something saturated from the ribs
down an old stony
word like ruin  Youre what roof
I have frail thing
youre my argument
against the whole sky 
Youre the fundamental difference
between wet and dry
