
Empty air has its own mechanism me dijo  
Its gears accord to whim 
 
We go out only when we have to me dijo  
We have hidden things for breathing 
 
You cant understand it prepped that way me dijo  
It always changes but never readily enough 
 
Some things we say more of and then again me dijo  
They always mean less once pre-written 
 
The context connections are far too frail me dijo  
To make them you need to pixel-point time 
 
There are no click-in-n-out pictures me dijo  
You facet your eyes to see them multiply 
 
There are hands held out everywhere me dijo  
We have to be careful what to step aroundin 
 
Sometimes we come this close too late me dijo  
Then we have to wait for inertia to embrace us 
 
We are the hungry hungry so ravenous me dijo  
We will tear at your insides and lick them clean
