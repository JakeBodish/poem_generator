
Insanity is not a want of reason  It is reasons overgrowth a calculating kudzu  Explaining why in two-ton manifesti thinkers sally forth with testaments and pipe bombs  Heaven help us spare us all your meaningful designs  Shine down or shower forth but for the earthlings sake ignore all prayers followed by against or for  Teach us to bear lifes senselessness our insignificance and more lets call that sanity  The terrifying prospect isnt some escapist with a novel fond of comfort munching sweets  it is the busy hermeneut so serious hes sour intent on making meaning of us all and bursting from the towers to the streets
