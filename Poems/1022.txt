
Will my ears grow long as Grandpas
What makes us look like kin
Tell me whered I get long eyelashes
and whered I get my chin
 
Whered I get my ice cream sweet tooth
and this nose that wiggles when I talk
Wheres I get my dizzy daydreams
and my foot-rolling side-step walk
Did I inherit my sense of humor
and these crooked ugly toes
What if I balloon like Uncle Harry
and have to shave my nose
 
How long after I start growing
until I start to shrink
Am I going to lose my teeth
some day
My hair
My mind
 
Do you think
Ill be tall or short or thin
or bursting at the seams
Am I naturally this crazy
Is it something in my genes
 
Im more than
who I am
Im also
who Im from 
Its a scary speculation--   
Who will I become
