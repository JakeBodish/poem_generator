
I wake up with a toothache think I should writeabout a toothache make it somehow worthwhile 
Its got everything intimacy decay how the bodys
busy night and day doing you in  One of the hundreds
of jumpers corpses pulled from the bay had a note
in its pocket saying No reason at all exceptI have a toothache  Joseys grandfather
shot himself after his fifth sinus operation failed 
Josey says Empty Nose Syndrome and I get confused 
how can hollows be hollowed But then I go to
emptynosesyndrome org cup my poor nose
in horror grateful for all I take for granted cant see 
Golden Gate Hank hates his nickname If you wanted to be called Serenity Hank
Ken tells him you shouldnt have jumpedoff the fucking bridge  The ones that live
all say they changed their minds in the four seconds
before they hit tried to land feet first and managed it 
Ken says dont tell people I think every dayof how I wouldnt kill myself they get the wrong idea 
I think every day of how Id save myself save
Josey stab the bad guy fall feet first punch the Great White
in his eyeball play dead in the bullet-ridden mass grave 
From the back seat of the Suburban I heard
my mother say to my father Driving across a high bridgealways makes me want to jump  You might live
A seventeen year old boy hit feet first swam to shore
and walked for help saying his back was killing him 
Another guy realized he was alive and underwater felt something
brushing his broken legs  Great now I get eaten by a shark
he thought  It happens  But this was a seal circlingapparently the only thing that was keeping me aliveand you can not tell me that wasnt God because thats what I believe and thats what Ill believe until the day I die
