Nota man is the intelligence of his soil
The sovereign ghost  As such the Socrates
Of snails musician of pears principium
And lex  Sed quaeritur is this same wig
Of things this nincompated pedagogue
Preceptor to the sea Crispin at sea
Created in his day a touch of doubt 
An eye most apt in gelatines and jupes
Berries of villages a barbers eye
An eye of land of simple salad-beds
Of honest quilts the eye of Crispin hung
On porpoises instead of apricots
And on silentious porpoises whose snouts
Dibbled in waves that were mustachios
Inscrutable hair in an inscrutable world 
One eats one paté even of salt quotha 
It was not so much the lost terrestrial
The snug hibernal from that sea and salt
That century of wind in a single puff 
What counted was mythology of self
Blotched out beyond unblotching  Crispin
The lutanist of fleas the knave the thane
The ribboned stick the bellowing breeches cloak
Of China cap of Spain imperative haw
Of hum inquisitorial botanist
And general lexicographer of mute
And maidenly greenhorns now beheld himself
A skinny sailor peering in the sea-glass 
What word split up in clickering syllables
And storming under multitudinous tones
Was name for this short-shanks in all that brunt
Crispin was washed away by magnitude 
The whole of life that still remained in him
Dwindled to one sound strumming in his ear
Ubiquitous concussion slap and sigh
Polyphony beyond his batons thrust 
Could Crispin stem verboseness in the sea
The old age of a watery realist
Triton dissolved in shifting diaphanes
Of blue and green A wordy watery age
That whispered to the suns compassion made
A convocation nightly of the sea-stars
And on the cropping foot-ways of the moon
Lay grovelling  Triton incomplicate with that
Which made him Triton nothing left of him
Except in faint memorial gesturings
That were like arms and shoulders in the waves
Here something in the rise and fall of wind
That seemed hallucinating horn and here
A sunken voice both of remembering
And of forgetfulness in alternate strain 
Just so an ancient Crispin was dissolved 
The valet in the tempest was annulled 
Bordeaux to Yucatan Havana next
And then to Carolina  Simple jaunt 
Crispin merest minuscule in the gates
Dejected his manner to the turbulence 
The salt hung on his spirit like a frost
The dead brine melted in him like a dew
Of winter until nothing of himself
Remained except some starker barer self
In a starker barer world in which the sun
Was not the sun because it never shone
With bland complaisance on pale parasols
Beetled in chapels on the chaste bouquets 
Against his pipping sounds a trumpet cried
Celestial sneering boisterously  Crispin
Became an introspective voyager 
Here was the veritable ding an sich at last
Crispin confronting it a vocable thing
But with a speech belched out of hoary darks
Noway resembling his a visible thing
And excepting negligible Triton free
From the unavoidable shadow of himself
That lay elsewhere around him  Severance
Was clear  The last distortion of romance
Forsook the insatiable egotist  The sea
Severs not only lands but also selves 
Here was no help before reality 
Crispin beheld and Crispin was made new 
The imagination here could not evade
In poems of plums the strict austerity
Of one vast subjugating final tone 
The drenching of stale lives no more fell down 
What was this gaudy gusty panoply
Out of what swift destruction did it spring
It was caparison of mind and cloud
And something given to make whole among
The ruses that were shattered by the large 
 
                                 iiConcerning the Thunderstorms of Yucatan
In Yucatan the Maya sonneteers
Of the Caribbean amphitheatre
In spite of hawk and falcon green toucan
And jay still to the night-bird made their plea
As if raspberry tanagers in palms
High up in orange air were barbarous 
But Crispin was too destitute to find
In any commonplace the sought-for aid 
He was a man made vivid by the sea
A man come out of luminous traversing
Much trumpeted made desperately clear
Fresh from discoveries of tidal skies
To whom oracular rockings gave no rest 
Into a savage color he went on 
How greatly had he grown in his demesne
This auditor of insects He that saw
The stride of vanishing autumn in a park
By way of decorous melancholy he
That wrote his couplet yearly to the spring
As dissertation of profound delight
Stopping on voyage in a land of snakes
Found his vicissitudes had much enlarged
His apprehension made him intricate
In moody rucks and difficult and strange
In all desires his destitutions mark 
He was in this as other freemen are
Sonorous nutshells rattling inwardly 
His violence was for aggrandizement
And not for stupor such as music makes
For sleepers halfway waking  He perceived
That coolness for his heat came suddenly
And only in the fables that he scrawled
With his own quill in its indigenous dew
Of an aesthetic tough diverse untamed
Incredible to prudes the mint of dirt
Green barbarism turning paradigm 
Crispin foresaw a curious promenade
Or nobler sensed an elemental fate
And elemental potencies and pangs
And beautiful barenesses as yet unseen
Making the most of savagery of palms
Of moonlight on the thick cadaverous bloom
That yuccas breed and of the panthers tread 
The fabulous and its intrinsic verse
Came like two spirits parlaying adorned
In radiance from the Atlantic coign
For Crispin and his quill to catechize 
But they came parlaying of such an earth
So thick with sides and jagged lops of green
So intertwined with serpent-kin encoiled
Among the purple tufts the scarlet crowns
Scenting the jungle in their refuges
So streaked with yellow blue and green and red
In beak and bud and fruity gobbet-skins
That earth was like a jostling festival
Of seeds grown fat too juicily opulent
Expanding in the golds maternal warmth 
So much for that  The affectionate emigrant found
A new reality in parrot-squawks 
Yet let that trifle pass  Now as this odd
Discoverer walked through the harbor streets
Inspecting the cabildo the façade
Of the cathedral making notes he heard
A rumbling west of Mexico it seemed
Approaching like a gasconade of drums 
The white cabildo darkened the façade
As sullen as the sky was swallowed up
In swift successive shadows dolefully 
The rumbling broadened as it fell  The wind
Tempestuous clarion with heavy cry
Came bluntly thundering more terrible
Than the revenge of music on bassoons 
Gesticulating lightning mystical
Made pallid flitter  Crispin here took flight 
An annotator has his scruples too 
He knelt in the cathedral with the rest
This connoisseur of elemental fate
Aware of exquisite thought  The storm was one
Of many proclamations of the kind
Proclaiming something harsher than he learned
From hearing signboards whimper in cold nights
Or seeing the midsummer artifice
Of heat upon his pane  This was the span
Of force the quintessential fact the note
Of Vulcan that a valet seeks to own
The thing that makes him envious in phrase 
And while the torrent on the roof still droned
He felt the Andean breath  His mind was free
And more than free elate intent profound
And studious of a self possessing him
That was not in him in the crusty town
From which he sailed  Beyond him westward lay
The mountainous ridges purple balustrades
In which the thunder lapsing in its clap
Let down gigantic quavers of its voice
For Crispin to vociferate again                                 iii                 Approaching Carolina
The book of moonlight is not written yet
Nor half begun but when it is leave room
For Crispin fagot in the lunar fire
Who in the hubbub of his pilgrimage
Through sweating changes never could forget
That wakefulness or meditating sleep
In which the sulky strophes willingly
Bore up in time the somnolent deep songs 
Leave room therefore in that unwritten book
For the legendary moonlight that once burned
In Crispins mind above a continent 
America was always north to him
A northern west or western north but north
And thereby polar polar-purple chilled
And lank rising and slumping from a sea
Of hardy foam receding flatly spread
In endless ledges glittering submerged
And cold in a boreal mistiness of the moon 
The spring came there in clinking pannicles
Of half-dissolving frost the summer came
If ever whisked and wet not ripening
Before the winters vacancy returned 
The myrtle if the myrtle ever bloomed
Was like a glacial pink upon the air 
The green palmettoes in crepuscular ice
Clipped frigidly blue-black meridians
Morose chiaroscuro gauntly drawn 
How many poems he denied himself
In his observant progress lesser things
Than the relentless contact he desired
How many sea-masks he ignored what sounds
He shut out from his tempering ear what thoughts
Like jades affecting the sequestered bride
And what descants he sent to banishment
Perhaps the Arctic moonlight really gave
The liaison the blissful liaison
Between himself and his environment
Which was and is chief motive first delight
For him and not for him alone  It seemed
Elusive faint more mist than moon perverse
Wrong as a divagation to Peking
To him that postulated as his theme
The vulgar as his theme and hymn and flight
A passionately niggling nightingale 
Moonlight was an evasion or if not
A minor meeting facile delicate 
Thus he conceived his voyaging to be
An up and down between two elements
A fluctuating between sun and moon
A sally into gold and crimson forms
As on this voyage out of goblinry
And then retirement like a turning back
And sinking down to the indulgences
That in the moonlight have their habitude 
But let these backward lapses if they would
Grind their seductions on him Crispin knew
It was a flourishing tropic he required
For his refreshment an abundant zone
Prickly and obdurate dense harmonious
Yet with a harmony not rarefied
Nor fined for the inhibited instruments
Of over-civil stops  And thus he tossed
Between a Carolina of old time
A little juvenile an ancient whim
And the visible circumspect presentment drawn
From what he saw across his vessels prow 
He came  The poetic hero without palms
Or jugglery without regalia 
And as he came he saw that it was spring
A time abhorrent to the nihilist
Or searcher for the fecund minimum 
The moonlight fiction disappeared  The spring
Although contending featly in its veils
Irised in dew and early fragrancies
Was gemmy marionette to him that sought
A sinewy nakedness  A river bore
The vessel inward  Tilting up his nose
He inhaled the rancid rosin burly smells
Of dampened lumber emanations blown
From warehouse doors the gustiness of ropes
Decays of sacks and all the arrant stinks
That helped him round his rude aesthetic out 
He savored rankness like a sensualist 
He marked the marshy ground around the dock
The crawling railroad spur the rotten fence
Curriculum for the marvellous sophomore 
It purified  It made him see how much
Of what he saw he never saw at all 
He gripped more closely the essential prose
As being in a world so falsified
The one integrity for him the one
Discovery still possible to make
To which all poems were incident unless
That prose should wear a poems guise at last                              iv               The Idea of a Colony
Nota his soil is mans intelligence 
Thats better  Thats worth crossing seas to find 
Crispin in one laconic phrase laid bare
His cloudy drift and planned a colony 
Exit the mental moonlight exit lex
Rex and principium exit the whole
Shebang  Exeunt omnes  Here was prose
More exquisite than any tumbling verse
A still new continent in which to dwell 
What was the purpose of his pilgrimage
Whatever shape it took in Crispins mind
If not when all is said to drive away
The shadow of his fellows from the skies
And from their stale intelligence released
To make a new intelligence prevail
Hence the reverberations in the words
Of his first central hymns the celebrants
Of rankest trivia tests of the strength
Of his aesthetic his philosophy
The more invidious the more desired 
The florist asking aid from cabbages
The rich man going bare the paladin
Afraid the blind man as astronomer
The appointed power unwielded from disdain 
His western voyage ended and began 
The torment of fastidious thought grew slack
Another still more bellicose came on 
He therefore wrote his prolegomena
And being full of the caprice inscribed
Commingled souvenirs and prophecies 
He made a singular collation  Thus
The natives of the rain are rainy men 
Although they paint effulgent azure lakes
And April hillsides wooded white and pink
Their azure has a cloudy edge their white
And pink the water bright that dogwood bears 
And in their music showering sounds intone 
On what strange froth does the gross Indian dote
What Eden sapling gum what honeyed gore
What pulpy dram distilled of innocence
That streaking gold should speak in him
Or bask within his images and words
If these rude instances impeach themselves
By force of rudeness let the principle
Be plain  For application Crispin strove
Abhorring Turk as Esquimau the lute
As the marimba the magnolia as rose 
Upon these premises propounding he
Projected a colony that should extend
To the dusk of a whistling south below the south 
A comprehensive island hemisphere 
The man in Georgia waking among pines
Should be pine-spokesman  The responsive man
Planting his pristine cores in Florida
Should prick thereof not on the psaltery
But on the banjos categorical gut
Tuck tuck while the flamingos flapped his bays 
Sepulchral señors bibbing pale mescal
Oblivious to the Aztec almanacs
Should make the intricate Sierra scan 
And dark Brazilians in their cafés
Musing immaculate pampean dits
Should scrawl a vigilant anthology
To be their latest lucent paramour 
These are the broadest instances  Crispin
Progenitor of such extensive scope
Was not indifferent to smart detail 
The melon should have apposite ritual
Performed in verd apparel and the peach
When its black branches came to bud belle day
Should have an incantation  And again
When piled on salvers its aroma steeped
The summer it should have a sacrament
And celebration  Shrewd novitiates
Should be the clerks of our experience 
These bland excursions into time to come
Related in romance to backward flights
However prodigal however proud
Contained in their afflatus the reproach
That first drove Crispin to his wandering 
He could not be content with counterfeit
With masquerade of thought with hapless words
That must belie the racking masquerade
With fictive flourishes that preordained
His passions permit hang of coat degree
Of buttons measure of his salt  Such trash
Might help the blind not him serenely sly 
It irked beyond his patience  Hence it was
Preferring text to gloss he humbly served
Grotesque apprenticeship to chance event
A clown perhaps but an aspiring clown 
There is a monotonous babbling in our dreams
That makes them our dependent heirs the heirs
Of dreamers buried in our sleep and not
The oncoming fantasies of better birth 
The apprentice knew these dreamers  If he dreamed
Their dreams he did it in a gingerly way 
All dreams are vexing  Let them be expunged 
But let the rabbit run the cock declaim 
Trinket pasticcio flaunting skyey sheets
With Crispin as the tiptoe cozener
No no veracious page on page exact                                 v                 A Nice Shady Home
Crispin as hermit pure and capable
Dwelt in the land  Perhaps if discontent
Had kept him still the pricking realist
Choosing his element from droll confect
Of was and is and shall or ought to be
Beyond Bordeaux beyond Havana far
Beyond carked Yucatan he might have come
To colonize his polar planterdom
And jig his chits upon a cloudy knee 
But his emprize to that idea soon sped 
Crispin dwelt in the land and dwelling there
Slid from his continent by slow recess
To things within his actual eye alert
To the difficulty of rebellious thought
When the sky is blue  The blue infected will 
It may be that the yarrow in his fields
Sealed pensive purple under its concern 
But day by day now this thing and now that
Confined him while it cosseted condoned
Little by little as if the suzerain soil
Abashed him by carouse to humble yet
Attach  It seemed haphazard denouement 
He first as realist admitted that
Whoever hunts a matinal continent
May after all stop short before a plum
And be content and still be realist 
The words of things entangle and confuse 
The plum survives its poems  It may hang
In the sunshine placidly colored by ground
Obliquities of those who pass beneath
Harlequined and mazily dewed and mauved
In bloom  Yet it survives in its own form
Beyond these changes good fat guzzly fruit 
So Crispin hasped on the surviving form
For him of shall or ought to be in is 
Was he to bray this in profoundest brass
Arointing his dreams with fugal requiems
Was he to company vastest things defunct
With a blubber of tom-toms harrowing the sky
Scrawl a tragedians testament Prolong
His active force in an inactive dirge
Which let the tall musicians call and call
Should merely call him dead Pronounce amen
Through choirs infolded to the outmost clouds
Because he built a cabin who once planned
Loquacious columns by the ructive sea
Because he turned to salad-beds again
Jovial Crispin in calamitous crape
Should he lay by the personal and make
Of his own fate an instance of all fate
What is one man among so many men
What are so many men in such a world
Can one man think one thing and think it long
Can one man be one thing and be it long
The very man despising honest quilts
Lies quilted to his poll in his despite 
For realists what is is what should be 
And so it came his cabin shuffled up
His trees were planted his duenna brought
Her prismy blonde and clapped her in his hands
The curtains flittered and the door was closed 
Crispin magister of a single room
Latched up the night  So deep a sound fell down
It was as if the solitude concealed
And covered him and his congenial sleep 
So deep a sound fell down it grew to be
A long soothsaying silence down and down 
The crickets beat their tambours in the wind
Marching a motionless march custodians 
In the presto of the morning Crispin trod
Each day still curious but in a round
Less prickly and much more condign than that
He once thought necessary  Like Candide
Yeoman and grub but with a fig in sight
And cream for the fig and silver for the cream
A blonde to tip the silver and to taste
The rapey gouts  Good star how that to be
Annealed them in their cabin ribaldries
Yet the quotidian saps philosophers
And men like Crispin like them in intent
If not in will to track the knaves of thought 
But the quotidian composed as his
Of breakfast ribands fruits laid in their leaves
The tomtit and the cassia and the rose
Although the rose was not the noble thorn
Of crinoline spread but of a pining sweet
Composed of evenings like cracked shutters flung
Upon the rumpling bottomness and nights
In which those frail custodians watched
Indifferent to the tepid summer cold
While he poured out upon the lips of her
That lay beside him the quotidian
Like this saps like the sun true fortuner 
For all it takes it gives a humped return
Exchequering from piebald fiscs unkeyed                                vi           And Daughters with Curls
Portentous enunciation syllable
To blessed syllable affined and sound
Bubbling felicity in cantilene
Prolific and tormenting tenderness
Of music as it comes to unison
Forgather and bell boldly Crispins last
Deduction  Thrum with a proud douceur
His grand pronunciamento and devise 
The chits came for his jigging bluet-eyed
Hands without touch yet touching poignantly
Leaving no room upon his cloudy knee
Prophetic joint for its diviner young 
The return to social nature once begun
Anabasis or slump ascent or chute
Involved him in midwifery so dense
His cabin counted as phylactery
Then place of vexing palankeens then haunt
Of children nibbling at the sugared void
Infants yet eminently old then dome
And halidom for the unbraided femes
Green crammers of the green fruits of the world
Bidders and biders for its ecstasies
True daughters both of Crispin and his clay 
All this with many mulctings of the man
Effective colonizer sharply stopped
In the door-yard by his own capacious bloom 
But that this bloom grown riper showing nibs
Of its eventual roundness puerile tints
Of spiced and weathery rouges should complex
The stopper to indulgent fatalist
Was unforeseen  First Crispin smiled upon
His goldenest demoiselle inhabitant
She seemed of a country of the capuchins
So delicately blushed so humbly eyed
Attentive to a coronal of things
Secret and singular  Second upon
A second similar counterpart a maid
Most sisterly to the first not yet awake
Excepting to the motherly footstep but
Marvelling sometimes at the shaken sleep 
Then third a thing still flaxen in the light
A creeper under jaunty leaves  And fourth
Mere blusteriness that gewgaws jollified
All din and gobble blasphemously pink 
A few years more and the vermeil capuchin
Gave to the cabin lordlier than it was
The dulcet omen fit for such a house 
The second sister dallying was shy
To fetch the one full-pinioned one himself
Out of her botches hot embosomer 
The third one gaping at the orioles
Lettered herself demurely as became
A pearly poetess peaked for rhapsody 
The fourth pent now a digit curious 
Four daughters in a world too intricate
In the beginning four blithe instruments
Of differing struts four voices several
In couch four more personæ intimate
As buffo yet divers four mirrors blue
That should be silver four accustomed seeds
Hinting incredible hues four self-same lights
That spread chromatics in hilarious dark
Four questioners and four sure answerers 
Crispin concocted doctrine from the rout 
The world a turnip once so readily plucked
Sacked up and carried overseas daubed out
Of its ancient purple pruned to the fertile main
And sown again by the stiffest realist
Came reproduced in purple family font
The same insoluble lump  The fatalist
Stepped in and dropped the chuckling down his craw
Without grace or grumble  Score this anecdote
Invented for its pith not doctrinal
In form though in design as Crispin willed
Disguised pronunciamento summary
Autumns compendium strident in itself
But muted mused and perfectly revolved
In those portentous accents syllables
And sounds of music coming to accord
Upon his law like their inherent sphere
Seraphic proclamations of the pure
Delivered with a deluging onwardness 
Or if the music sticks if the anecdote
Is false if Crispin is a profitless
Philosopher beginning with green brag
Concluding fadedly if as a man
Prone to distemper he abates in taste
Fickle and fumbling variable obscure
Glozing his life with after-shining flicks
Illuminating from a fancy gorged
By apparition plain and common things
Sequestering the fluster from the year
Making gulped potions from obstreperous drops
And so distorting proving what he proves
Is nothing what can all this matter since
The relation comes benignly to its end
So may the relation of each man be clipped
