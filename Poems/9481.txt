
Theres a place between two stands of trees where the grass grows uphill
and the old revolutionary road breaks off into shadows
near a meeting-house abandoned by the persecuted
who disappeared into those shadows 
Ive walked there picking mushrooms at the edge of dread but dont be fooled
this isnt a Russian poem this is not somewhere else but here
our country moving closer to its own truth and dread
its own ways of making people disappear 
I wont tell you where the place is the dark mesh of the woods
meeting the unmarked strip of light 
ghost-ridden crossroads leafmold paradise
I know already who wants to buy it sell it make it disappear 
And I wont tell you where it is so why do I tell you
anything Because you still listen because in times like these
to have you listen at all its necessary
to talk about trees
