
Surviving in its fragile skin
a white egret rises
from the gulf of its strength 
I want the lightest needle of a pine
to fall on my hand
a pine with ravaged limbs 
Id stare through salt-blind eyes
at a remote fragile sea    Id roar 
Id make the skeleton of grief 
Id roar like you unreconciled sea
