
A full year passed the seasons keep me honest
since I last noticed this same commotion 
Who knew God was an abstract expressionist
I’m asking myself the very question
I asked last year staring out at this array
of racing colors then set in motion
by the chance invasion of a Steller’s jay 
Is this what people mean by speed of light
My usually levelheaded mulberry tree
hurling arrows everywhere in sight 
its bow the out-of-control Virginia creeper
my friends say I should do something about
whose vermilion went at least a full shade deeper
at the provocation of the upstart blue
the leaves half green half gold suddenly hyper
in savage competition with that red and blue 
tohubohu returned in living color 
Kandinsky where were you when I needed you
My attempted poem would lie fallow a year
I was so busy focusing on the desert’s
stinginess with everything but rumor 
No place even for the spectrum’s introverts 
rose olive gray no pigment at all 
and certainly no room for shameless braggarts
like the ones that barge in here every fall
and make me feel like an unredeemed failure
even more emphatically than usual 
And here they are again their fleet allure
still more urgent this time the desert’s gone
I’m through with it want something fuller 
why shouldn’t a person have a little fun
some utterly unnecessary extravagance
Which was at least I think it was God’s plan
when He set up such things are never left to chance
that one split-second assignation
with genuine no-kidding-around omnipotence
what for lack of better words I’m calling vision 
You breathe in and for once there’s something there 
Just when you thought you’d learned some resignation
there’s real resistance in the nearby air
until the entire universe is swayed 
Even that desert of yours isn’t quite so bare
and God’s not nonexistent He’s just been waylaid
by a host of what no one could’ve foreseen 
He’s got plans for you this red-gold-green parade
is actually a fairly detailed outline 
David never needed one but he’s long dead
and God could use a little recognition 
He promises  It won’t go to His head
and if you praise Him properly an autumn psalm
Why didn’t I think of that you’ll have it made 
But while it’s true that my Virginia creeper praises Him
its palms and fingers crimson with applause
that the local breeze is weaving Him a diadem
inspecting my tree’s uncut gold for flaws
I came to talk about the way that violet-blue
sprang the greens and reds and yellows
into action actual motion  I swear it’s true
though I’m not sure I ever took it in 
Now I’d be prepared if some magician flew
into my field of vision to realign
that dazzle out my window yet again 
It’s not likely but I’m keeping my eyes open
though I still wouldn’t be able to explain
precisely what happened to these vines these trees 
It isn’t available in my tradition 
For this I would have to be Chinese
Wang Wei to be precise on a mountain
autumn rain converging on the trees
a cassia flower nearby a cloud a pine
washerwomen heading home for the day
my senses and the mountain so entirely in tune
that when my stroke of blue arrives I’m ready 
Though there is no rain here the air’s shot through
with gold on golden leaves  Wang Wei’s so giddy
he’s calling back the dead Li Bai Du Fu
Guys You’ve got to see this autumn sun
