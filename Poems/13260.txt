
I am so young that I am still in love
with Battle Creek Michigan decoder rings
submarines powered by baking soda   
whistles that only dogs can hear  Actually   
not even them  Nobody can hear them 
Mrs  Hill from next door is hammering   
on our front door shouting and my father
in his black and gold gangster robe lets her in   
trembling and bunched up like a rabbit in snow   
pleading oh I’m so sorry so sorry
so sorry
