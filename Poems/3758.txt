
But unfortunately it can only travel into the future
at a rate of one second per second
 
which seems slow to the physicists and to the grant
committees and even to me 
 
But I manage to get there time after time to the next
moment and to the next 
 
Thing is I cant turn it off  I keep zipping ahead 
well not zipping And if I try
 
to get out of this time machine open the latch
Ill fall into space unconscious
 
then desiccated And Im pretty sure Im afraid of that 
So I stay inside 
 
Theres a window though  It shows the past 
Its like a television or fish tank 
 
But its never live its always over  The fish swim
in backward circles 
 
Sometimes its like a rearview mirror another chance
to see what Im leaving behind
 
and sometimes like blackout all that time
wasted sleeping 
 
Myself age eight whole head burnt with embarrassment
at having lost a library book 
 
Myself lurking in a candled corner expecting
to be found charming 
 
Me holding a rose though I want to put it down
so I can smoke 
 
Me exploding at my mother who explodes at me
because the explosion
 
of some dark star all the way back struck hard
at mothers mothers mother 
 
I turn away from the window anticipating a blow 
I thought Id find myself
 
an old woman by now traveling so light in time 
But I havent gotten far at all 
 
Strange not to be able to pick up the pace as Id like
the past is so horribly fast
