
Aliens have inhabited my aesthetics for
decades  Really since the early 70s 
Before that I pretty much wrote
as myself though young  But something
has happened to my memory my
judgment apparently my will has been
affected  That old stuff the fork
in my head first home run
Dad falling out of the car 
I remember the words but I
cant get back there anymore  I
think they must be screening my
sensations  Im sure my categories have
been messed with  I look at
the anthologies in the big chains
and campus bookstores even the small
press opium dens all those stanzas
against the white space they just
look like the models in the
catalogs  The models have arms and
legs and a head the poems
mostly dont but other than that
its hard for me anyway to
tell them apart  Theres the sexy
underwear poem the sturdy workboot poem
you could wear to a party
in a pinch the little blaspheming
dress poem  Theres variety you say
the button-down oxford with offrhymed cuffs 
The epic toga showing some ancient
ankle the behold the world is
changed and finally Im normal flowing
robe and shorts the full nude
the scatter Yes I suppose theres
variety but the looks those come
on and read me for the
inner you Ive locked onto with
my cultural capital sensing device looks
No thanks Jay Peterman No thanks
Ordinary Evening in New Haven Im
just waiting for my return ticket
to have any meaning for those
saucer-shaped clouds to lower The authorities
deny any visitations hardly a surprise 
And I myself deny them think
about it  What could motivate a
group of egg-headed tentacled slimier-than-thou aestheticians
with techniquies far beyond ours to
visit earth abduct naive poets and
inculcate them with otherwordly forms that
are also if you believe the
tabloids salacious And these abductions always
seem to take place in some
provincial setting isnt that more than
slightly suspicious Why dont they ever
reveal themselves hovering over some New
York publishing venue It would be
nice to get some answers here 
we might learn something about poetry
if nothing else but Im not
much help since Im an abductee
at least in theory though like
I say I dont remember much 
But this writing seems pretty normal
complete sentences semicolons yada yada  I
seem to have lost my avant-garde
card in the laundry  They say
thats typical  Well youll just have
to use your judgment earthlings Judgment
thats your job Back to work
As if you could leave And
you thought gravity was a problem
