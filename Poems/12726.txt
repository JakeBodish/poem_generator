
Im going out to clean the pasture springIll only stop to rake the leaves awayAnd wait to watch the water clear I mayI shant be gone long  You come too Im going out to fetch the little calfThats standing by the mother  Its so youngIt totters when she licks it with her tongue I shant be gone long  You come too
