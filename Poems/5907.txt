
It was a blessèd time we were at the beachGo out early in the morning no shoes no hats no tiesAnd quick as a toad’s tongue can reachLove wounded the hearts of the mad and the wise Did you know Guy when he galloped along When he was a military man Did you know Guy when he galloped along When he was an artiman In the war It was a blessèd time At mail callWe are squeezed in tighter than on a busAnd the stars passing by were mimicked by the shellsIn the night when the cannons came rolling upDid you know Guy when he galloped along When he was a military man Did you know Guy when he galloped along When he was an artiman In the war It was a blessèd time Days and nights blendingThe stew-pot shells gave our trench dugoutAluminum shrapnel that you set aboutSmoothing all day into an unlikely ringDid you know Guy when he galloped along When he was a military man Did you know Guy when he galloped along When he was an artiman In the war It was a blessèd time The war goes onThe Gunners have filed for part of a yearSafe in the woods the Driver can hearAn unknown star repeating a songDid you know Guy when he galloped along When he was a military man Did you know Guy when he galloped along When he was an artiman In the war Translated from the French
