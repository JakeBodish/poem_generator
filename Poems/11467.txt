
As I drew nearer to the end of all desire
I brought my longings ardor to a final height
Just as I ought  My vision becoming pure
Entered more and more the beam of that high light
That shines on its own truth  From then my seeing
Became too large for speech which fails at a sight
Beyond all boundaries at memorys undoing 
As when the dreamer sees and after the dream
The passion endures imprinted on his being
Though he cant recall the rest  I am the same
Inside my heart although my vision is almost
Entirely faded droplets of its sweetness come
The way the sun dissolves the snows crust 
The way in the wind that stirred the light leaves   
The oracle that the Sibyl wrote was lost
