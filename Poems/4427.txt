
all the rain came down at once like a dropped bag
of aquarium pebbles  too much for the street to swallow
all gravel  grit  i feel the saltwater rushing
in my mouth as i hit the shore   sand becoming rice 
the pot on the stove   put on the lid  we read the
back of the bag   bring the water to a boil   it
protests in the clouds  rainwater peeling open
car windows to fill the floor   make mobile your
lakes  the herons will come   don’t feed the birds rice 
my favorite summer storms are the ones
that come too fast  they remind me so much of myself
gathering their gray hair in a bouquet to beat
against the highway  i think of the times the thunder
would toss geodes at the street until they cracked open
about dad telling my brother  i to go upstairs
 shut the windows before the storm snuck inside 
the car prayed until it drove on water   ocean barreling
toward us like a great big whale blueness open  mouth full
of salt  you ask if we should stir the rice  the water
hisses  spits  we often forget about the ghosts
who kneel in pots of water  there’s always a wooden spoon  i keep
mine in the glove box  taking it out i park the car with
the four-ways on  other monsters slosh past 
we get out on the side of the road  kneeling i plunge
the spoon into the bank chicken broth  rice 
rain warming our bodies until there’s no
mistaking us from the stove  i burn my feet getting
back into the car  our flesh turns chicken-white  tender 
somewhere in all of this i managed
to drive across the whole unknown ocean   the one
without a name that shows up only when it downpours 
makes tides that eat radar  sailors 
picks rice grains from her teeth 
the other side is not land but soft rice steaming
 ready  our legs sink in  take a spoonful of me
before i drive home a second time  the sun emerging like
a quartered bell pepper  i’m thinking of
lying in a rain puddle with you  falling apart
into a palm full of cooked rice
