
Give me some light cries Hamlets
uncle midway through the murder
of Gonzago  Light Light cry scattering
courtesans  Here as in Denmark
its dark at four and even the moon
shines with only half a heart 
The ornaments go down into the box
the silver spaniel My Darling
on its collar from Mothers childhood
in Illinois the balsa jumping jack
my brother and I fought over
pulling limb from limb  Mother
drew it together again with thread
while I watched feeling depraved
at the age of ten 
With something more than caution
I handle them and the lights with their
tin star-shaped reflectors brought along
from house to house their pasteboard
toy suitcases increasingly flimsy 
Tick tick the desiccated needles drop 
By suppertime all that remains is the scent
of balsam fir  If its darkness
were having let it be extravagant
