
As thro the land at eve we went      And pluckd the ripend earsWe fell out my wife and IO we fell out I know not why      And kissd again with tears And blessings on the falling out      That all the more endearsWhen we fall out with those we love      And kiss again with tearsFor when we came where lies the child      We lost in other yearsThere above the little graveO there above the little grave      We kissd again with tears
