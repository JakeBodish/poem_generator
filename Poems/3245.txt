
We practiced together
sweat and stained 
We pummeled each other
and laughed off pain 
Teams may disagree
may tease
may blame 
Teams may bicker and whine
but get down for the game 
You had my back 
We fought the fight 
And though our score
was less last night
were walking tall 
Our team came through
and stuck together like Crazy Glue 
Im proud to say
I lost with you
