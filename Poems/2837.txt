
If it had become a competition in which we
Like children desperate for the blue ribbon
Pulled knotted hemp gripping until certain
Of calluses if our contest awarded the strongestThe boy who could best inflict pain yet not Flinch when injured then you won for I must Imagine the brown of your back to reach my Peak a short thread of breaths a tug of warWith the heaviest child grunting at the end Of the rope until jerked and dragged over The line  That fat kid flounders through muckThe way I splash your relentless name In shivers about me  Watch him wallow  If he tastes mud as bitter as this poemOf mine then I win – and you love me
