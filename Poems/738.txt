
A cradle thief my mother called the man
wed see in shops cafes parks even church
with that poor girl beside him  Hand in hand
theyd walk as if they didnt feel the scorch
of peoples stares  The day we saw him press
his lips to hers my mother blocked my eyes
as if his mouth I longed for my first kiss
against her mouth was smothering her cries 
All week I ran a fever that wouldnt break 
A cradle thief a voice I only half
knew as my own surprised me in the dark
my sick-bed wet with shivers  A cradle thief
I said again as if the words could will
my window broken footprint on the sill
