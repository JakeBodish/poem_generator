
Does my little son miss the smell
of his first mother I wonder
as the mewl of his mouth
opens toward a plastic bottle
that is not her breast 
 
Sudden new mother
I bury my nose deep
into his skullcap of ringlets
his starry cheesiness 
 
In her good-bye letter to him
sealed in his album
with a birth certificate which now
list my name as Mother
 
his first mother writes
she nursed him briefly
after he emerged into
the second room of his world 
 
I think of milk volcanic
and insistent answering
the newborn’s gigantic thirst
a primal agreement between
generosity and greed 
 
Sometimes I press my nose
to the glass of that place
where a mother and my child
belong to each other
I cannot imagine coming
between them 
 
But then I want to lick him all over
with a cow’s thick tongue
to taste him and mark him as mine
so if the other mother returns
she will refuse her handled calf
smeared with my smell
