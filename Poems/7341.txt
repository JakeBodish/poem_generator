
Farewell love and all thy laws foreverThy baited hooks shall tangle me no more Senec and Plato call me from thy loreTo perfect wealth my wit for to endeavour In blind error when I did perseverThy sharp repulse that pricketh aye so soreHath taught me to set in trifles no storeAnd scape forth since liberty is lever Therefore farewell go trouble younger heartsAnd in me claim no more authority With idle youth go use thy propertyAnd thereon spend thy many brittle dartsFor hitherto though I have lost all my timeMe lusteth no lenger rotten boughs to climb
