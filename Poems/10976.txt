
There’s an Isle a green Isle set in the sea     Here’s to the Saint that blessed itAnd here’s to the billows wild and free     That for centuries have caressed itHere’s to the day when the men that roam     Send longing eyes o’er the waterHere’s to the land that still spells home     To each loyal son and daughterHere’s to old Ireland fair I ween     With the blue skies stretched above herHere’s to her shamrock warm and green     And here’s to the hearts that love her
