
This is an old apartment and therefore the mirrors are huge and ornate  They go with the high ornate ceilings  There’s one such mirror in the living room and another in the bedroom  Both have intricately carved borders and a leafy crest on top  In the living room these have been painted over in white but in the bedroom it’s still the original gilt rococo  Both mirrors sit on top of fireplaces and are as big as tombs  I think the descriptive term for them is French Regency Baroque 
The mirror in the bathroom is pretty big too and again somewhat ornate  And there are two other mirrors here as well  Not bad for a small one-bedroom flat 
The problem is I’ve never been too fond of mirrors  I rarely look into them and only then to make sure my hair isn’t sticking up or there’s no toothpaste showing or when I’m fine-trimming the beard to make sure I’ve missed no section  Oh there are exceptional other occasions  Once when I got a red eye on a transatlantic flight for example I kept checking on the progress of the red’s disappearance  Or when I fell on gravel and got an ugly friction wound on my forehead I had to first deal with applying the dressing then keep an eye on how that healing was coming along  Very slowly as it happened 
As for gazing into the mirror to see if  I look OK enough to go out into the world or   perish the thought   if I look attractive today the answer is no way Que sera sera as the song goes 
Tiny children love the mirror and it’s very pleasant to watch them gazing into it  Dogs don’t understand it and bark fiercely at the rival dog that’s their reflection  I once gave a woman a full-length mirror as an Xmas present  It wasn’t ornate or gilded and it got smashed soon afterwards and seven years of bad luck followed 
But if   I want to look at myself in the mirror regularly or for lengthy periods there’s plenty opportunity for it in this apartment  I could even stand naked and see everything  And as Monsieur Baudelaire reminds us according to the immortal principles of 1789 everyone has equal rights therefore I have the right to behold myself with pleasure or distaste  It is between me and my conscience
