
That whine is the sound
of waste rot the frantic
grinding inability to attend
to anything but sere thwarting
of yourself a dry corrosion
which some say they know
but you and I 
 my jaw clenched as youturn a pageyou with a heart like drywallI who wouldlace my arms with razorsthen press themslowly to your lipsthe metal tastemixing with fleshand through gritted teethI making the soundof you you youdo not know meaningonly me me
 
we know best
