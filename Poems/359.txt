
White-Mexican looks like a Latina
not my label
a question
from a Guatemalan student
whos come undone
in my ESL class
doesnt get my kind
I try to describe
how I grew up
in Caucasian corn country
surrounded by houses
on cul-de-sacs
that all looked the same
how we were alone
in a town of 5000
one black family
one Indian family
one Asian family
and one household of Mexicans
no two us and the Renterias
to whom we were related by marriage
before and after my divorce
and they were mixed
still it was a good living
happy in our cocooness
our oneness
separated by money
one direction
color on the other
classes classes classes
day and night
we took lessons
piano jazz tap ballet
the dance team trumpet
trombone tennis Finishing School
and one awful summer golf
Christened Confirmed Cathechismized
it all cut me in several places
molding of head and heart
making me ultrasensitive
then and now
an observer of the outside
an outsider among my own kind
my very shade
mysterious aloof
black haired beauty
who cant speak Spanish
living among blue eyed dyed blond bombshells
who held up her head higher
because shes shy not stuck-up
understood undenied sacrificed to at any price
by my beloved little brown parents
who taught me well
gave up so much
so their daughters could shine
and theyd swell with pride
at the life they had given us
on Sundays we basked
in mutual admiration after mass
singing our church songs while making breakfast
according to the unspoken doctrine in our house of
fast first eat later after communion
we intruded with our Mexican music
bellowing out the open windows
the smell of bacon frying
pancakes baking coffee
and eggs scrambled to order
it wafted out on beautiful summer mornings
out of our house in Pleasant Hill Iowa
perched on the highest spot
one could reach on the East Side of the street
for first and second generation immigrants
