it isnt matter
isnt doesnt matter
does it compared
with what shant
have known your
lines are all
lines of approach
this dogs eyelids
this delhi dogs
intentional eyelids this
doorway dog this
dog fellating beggars
delhi exuding matter
nictitation cannot extrude
America to england
the third nictitating
poetry is over
eyelid cannot eject
America to england
large foreign bodies
poetry is over
over and out
surgery rarely happens
over and ours
dogs arent loved
over here here
sufficiently foreign bodies
remain requiring incision
mind yourself it
happened before you
as you go
youre nothing cold
sunshine practised apprehension
