
I was climbing up the sliding board
When suddenly I felt
A mosquito bite my bottom
And it raised a big red welt 
So I said to that mosquito
“Im sure you wouldnt mind
If I took a pair of tweezers
And I tweezered your behind”
He shriveled up his body
And he shuffled to his feet
And he said “Im awfully sorry
But a skeeters got to eat
Still there are mosquito manners
And I must have just forgot em 
And I swear Ill never never never
Bite another bottom ”
But a minute later Archie Hill
And Buck and Theo Brown
Were horsing on the monkey bars
Hanging upside down 
They must have looked delicious
From a skeeters point of view
Cause he bit em on the bottoms
Archie Buck and Theo too
You could hear em goin HOLY
You could hear em goin WHACK
You could hear em cuss and holler
Goin smack smack smack 
A mosquitos awful sneaky
A mosquitos mighty sly
But I never never never
Thought a skeeterd tell a lie
