
She and I make a bladder bag to draw water from the ice trench 
SheI chain stitches a skin dressed in oil to make a new pot of soup 
SheI sews a badger hair rough around the top of hermy kamiks
to make the steps windward toward the limits of woman 
SheI eats club root and white clover to strengthen hermy silver
body to bear a child  SheI maps following 1 degree from the North
Star and 60 degrees from the end of the earth’s axis on rotation
for Ukpeagvik sheI uses a small arc of ice cleaving into parts reduced
to simple curves fitted with serrated edges of white flesh  SheI molds
to the fretted neck of frozen water into a deep urn made like a rock shelter
or a cavern  SheI constructs a hole on the surface of a glacier formed by melting particles
of roe and pan reservoir dust from a shelter for the ice worms  Because the earth is
molding burning laughing and purging its crust
