
The chickens are back in their coop 
The kids are out on the town 
Its here in one fell swoop 
                Its sundown 
Youve heard them say it before 
The rumours been going around 
Youre heading straight for the door 
                Its sundown 
                Youve forgotten what you said 
                All that matters is here and now
                No ones getting you to bed
                even though its sundown 
The trucks roll by on the highway 
You want to follow that sound 
You want to have your say
               at sundown 
The dusk turns into dark 
You walk away with a frown 
Youre the only one in the park
               past sundown 
               Heres where the children played
               but theyre not here right now 
               You dont want to end your day
               even though its sundown
