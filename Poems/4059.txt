
To pass through astonishment and know much too late 
And because habit makes us strange I find myself
Searching on a landscape that generates questions
Beyond its ability to solve  That dark post
Out there might be this poem standing as you would   
Lead in the 4th grade play   under theater lights
And your shadows that petal around you  And what
Should be most memorable isn’t  So I recall
Those prolonged moments of silence incongruous
And revealing as metaphor most frequently 
For instance waiting at the bus stop in Pai in
A midmorning the hue of the roadside guardrails
That dot the cliff’s side like Morse code  Before leaving
With trees those felled ones half-painted white the burnt trunks        
That passed by like the so many phenomena
Of our days blurred together into a motion
At times convincing as a nickelodeon’s
I waited under the thatched roof of the station
With other travelers  With each in our common
Solitude risen around like that Haydn piece
In the tunnel I descended into on my
Way out onto Broadway from the 1 train some months
Ago it seemed of Hopper  Star fruit on the ground
Discolored withering blighted  Three of the town’s
Strays hobbled by before midday’s heat stalled the town
Like some lost Stephano Trinculo and their lamed
Dark sycophant   at least that’s what they were for me 
It wasn’t comfort never comfort but something else 
And when each moment with expectations for more
Than it can hold leads to the next and soon   as then   
Expectation fills up the day as does your breath
A balloon the day floats with such care and strange hours And both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul        
Plato wrote   poetry’s banisher beauty’s guard 2
My hands grow differently used  While one hand thumbs
Pages the other hand steadies open the book 
It’s the other hand that rests on the desk forearm
Paralleled to the table’s edge all the fingers
Except the thumb holding the blank field  One hand’s mole
A gnat flattened between pinky and ring finger
The other hand’s palm-side below the skin enough
It’s likely a splinter left for years  Just one hand
Fits my Discman plugged in while watching those around
No news-as-white-noise here to occupy my sight
Kids who bus to school hours away toothpicking
Slivers of chili-dappled mango slices in
A triple-sweatered lady palming back her hair
In the thick Thai pre-dawn June the one foreigner
Other than us earphone couched and her shape dozed slack
Coat-blanketed neck against my side  One hand rests 
Half a day ago under a mosquito net
Flush with the desk fan sitting on the rattan floor
One hand kept on the steady act of beckoning
Behind the tongue-swelled clit uncreasing the ridged roof
Almost like the mouth’s roof as it slopes down toward teeth
Like rubbing the dampened cave wall finger-darkened
As the guide turns his back to us  The other hand
Traced its crook   that delta-creased pad set between thumb
And fingers hand’s most fleshy zone   on the torso 
The other hand then stilled her hip mosquito net
Weighted walling out stitches of ants from its hook
A viscous drape like that through one hand’s two fingers 
Oddly only one hand drums along the CD
Converge Jane Doe as the crowd would rupture outward
Into a circle pit   a vortex in reverse   
If this were a concert  The other hand just bides
Its time  Milton’s clumsy other hand God’s other
Hand that Lessing chose and that Spaniard’s other hand
Riddled useless at Lepanto a bullet lodged
Into that scurvied poet’s chest the other hand
Remembers and betrays  The other hand cries outWhich was Keats’s living one Neither hand scarred yet
Even after thumb-knuckle tempted a sander
In shop class impulse from imagining too much 
One hand’s cushion bears the pencil my friend whose tasks
Are split between his hands   “I eat with my left hand
Punch with the other”   says we whack off with the hand
We write  Each hand on different shaded denim thighs
The unclipped nails crude halos of sun-blocking hills 
One hand lets forth words the other hand holds it back 3
Chased by a three-legged dog to the temple stairs
Past all the fallen star fruit the veined tips the last
To wither the through-light flesh sun- and bug-eaten
We crossed paths with a one-legged man   wordless sounds
And that permanent wild gaze   crutching down the stairs
Four hundred as we stopped to catch a break mid-flight 
Our breath would last us a run-through of the temple
And in the first hallway   him his phatic calls tics
And unwilled smile facing the morning that just passed
The sun no longer in front of his propped body
But above it the valley overabundant
With the real light that stole our day  The fog too lifted
Against my sight  We paused  Having just climbed the hill
We agreed to leave our shoes on despite sandals
Stationed on the stoop and then we turned towards that hall 
“Let’s go” he ends befriended prayer Phaedrus-empty 
   The driver gases the bus off the parking brakes
To idle back out the station the attendants
Scoop up the wood wedges and clatter the door shut
The passengers all shift  In the chapter among
The deformed and footless Zhuangzi ends arguing
For the greatest of men a man void of feelings
“The Way gave him a face Heaven gave him a form
Can’t you call him a man” Yet there are things I love
The sun you travel  And back again the thick fog
Parts us from the obliterating Turner sun 
Pretty soon come day the motorbikes The Rough Guide
Says all tourists should try will buzz by those three dogs
All lethargic the largest too tired to dry-hump
His red tip unsheathing there’s no neutering here
The black one bald in spots wouldn’t even fight it off
The mottled one coiled back like the dog that badgers
Bosch’s wayfarer bandaged poor bastard with his gnarled stick
Not looking at us but rather caught looking back
And above his head a doorway   no the gallows   
The same one Brueghel’s final peasants romped beneath
My turn now to sleep  I can dab off from my jeans
Your drool just reaching my thigh as you do with care
From our sheets when   yet that stuff all that stuff of ours
Still spots our many beds with different aged salt-rings
Each gasp less a sound than a failure at silence 
Before us another strange town while for others
School home maybe work a field someplace normal there
Someplace beyond sight from its roadside stop  Abroad
A month toward a year in another country Anne   
Anacrusis these days I’m lost in reminded
Of my presence as if catching a stranger’s wave
To the yet-to-be-seen man behind you as yours
