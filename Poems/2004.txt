
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groanFor that deep wound it gives my friend and meIs’t not enough to torture me aloneBut slave to slavery my sweet’st friend must beMe from myself thy cruel eye hath takenAnd my next self thou harder hast engrossedOf him myself and thee I am forsakenA torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed  Prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward But then my friends heart let my poor heart bailWhoe’er keeps me let my heart be his guardThou canst not then use rigour in my jail     And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee     Perforce am thine and all that is in me
