Every morning since the time changedI have woken to the dawn chorusAnd even before it sounded I dreamed of itLoud unbelievably loud shameless raucousAnd once I rose and twitched the curtains apartExpecting the birds to be pressing in frightAgainst the pane like passengersBut the garden was empty and it was nightNot a slither of light at the horizonStill the birds were bawling through the mistsTerrible invisibleA million small evangelistsHow they sing as if each had pecked up a smoldering coalTheir throats singed and swollen with song In dissonance as befits the dark worldWhere only travelers and the sleepless belong
