
It was winter near freezing
Id walked through a forest of firs
when I saw issue out of the waterfall
a solitary bird 
It lit on a damp rock
and as water swept stupidly on
wrung from its own throat
supple undammable song 
It isnt mine to give 
I cant coax this bird to my hand
that knows the depth of the river
yet sings of it on land
