No nor a fierce hurrahfor what it does without choicefor following the lightfor the same reason the light follows it Just a thing rough to the touch a facelike a thousand ticks turning their backssuckling at something you can’t seeand a body like a tag off the earthso that my child hands couldn’t tear it outfrom the overgrown lot next door                            My palms raw with the shockof quills and spines  Its hold like spite and uglyexcept when seen from a distance a whole field of them by the highwayan 80-mile-per-hour view                           like a camera’s flash All of them like haloswithout saints to weigh them down
