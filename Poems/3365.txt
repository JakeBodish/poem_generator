
They darken  In the sky over Florence
the oblong clouds swell and darken 
And hailstones lift back through the updrafts
thickening darkening until swollen as bird eggs
they drop to the cobbled streets Horses the child Galileo thinks then
peeks through the doorway
to the shock of ten thousand icy hooves 
At his back his father is tuning violins
and because there is nothing sharper at hand
Galileo saws through a captured hailstone
with a length of E-string
the white globe opening slowly and the pattern inside
already bleeding its frail borders 
Layers and layers of ice 
Like what Onion pulp Cypress rings
If only the room were colder and the eye
finer  If only the hand were faster
and the blade sharper and firmer
and without a hint of song
