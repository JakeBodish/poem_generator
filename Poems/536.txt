
The bus steps are high but William clambers up gamely 
Doors shut  He peers out a print-marked window 
From the street corner I wave wistful as a soldier’s bride
as his bus pulls away and turns a corner 
 
At noon the yellow bus returns him
to the same place where I’m standing again 
He thinks I stood there all day waiting in his absence 
When he finds out I left to play tennis
 
his forehead crumples like paper in a wastebasket 
Now he knows I can move on my own without him 
Tears drawn from the well of desertion form in his eyes 
I’m his first love and his greatest disappointment
