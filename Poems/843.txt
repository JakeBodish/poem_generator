
Oh yet one smile tho dark may lower 
Around thee clouds of woe and ill 
Let me yet feel that I have power 
Mid Fates bleak storms to soothe thee still  
Tho sadness be upon thy brow 
Yet let it turn dear love to me 
I cannot bear that thou shouldst know 
Sorrow I do not share with thee  
True loves wreath is of mountain flowers 
They stand the storm and brave the blast 
And blossom on so love like ours 
Is sweetest when all else is past  
Too well I know what storms have frowned 
And now frown on lifes troubled tide 
Still darker let them gather round 
They have no power on hearts so tried  
Then say not that you may not bear 
To shadow spirit light as mine 
I shall not shrink or fear to share 
The darkest fate if it be thine
 
 Oh say not love was never made 
For heart so light as mine 
Must love then seek the cypress shade 
Rear but a gloomy shrine  
Oh say not that for me more meet 
The revelry of youth 
Or that my wild heart cannot beat 
With deep devoted truth  
Tho mirth may many changes ring 
Tis but an outward show 
Even upon the fond doves wing 
Will varying colours glow  
Light smiles upon my lip may gleam 
And sparkle oer my brow 
Tis but the glisten of the stream 
That hides the gold below  
Tis love that gilds the mirthful hour 
That lights the smile for me 
Those smiles would instant lose their power 
Did they not glance on thee
 
 Oh come to my slumber 
Sweet dreams of my love 
I have hung the charmed wreath 
My soft pillow above  
The roses are linked 
In a chain pure and white 
And the rose-leaves are wet 
With the dew drops of night  
The moon was on high 
As I gatherd each flower 
The dew that then falls 
Has a magical power  
The Spirit of slumber 
Those roses has blest 
And sweet are the visions 
Theyll bring to my rest  
Be their spell on my soul 
So they let me but see 
His dark eyes flash in love 
And his smile glance on me  
Let sleep bring the image 
Of him far away 
Tis worth all the tears 
I shed for him by day  
I have hung the charmed wreath 
My soft pillow above 
Then come to my slumber 
Sweet dreams of my love
 
 
How vain to cast my love away 
On bosom false as thine 
The flowerets bloom that springs in May 
Would be a safer shrine 
To build my fondest hopes upon 
Tho fragile it may be  
That flowers smile is not sooner gone 
Than love that trusts to thee  
Love asks a calm a gentle home 
Or else its life is oer 
If once you let its pinions roam 
Oh then tis love no more  
The aspins changefuI shade can be 
No shelter for the dove 
And hearts as varying as that tree 
Are sure no place for love  
Hope lingerd long and anxiously 
Oer failing faith but now 
I give thee back each heartless sigh 
Give back each broken vow  
Ill trust the stay of tulip dyes 
The calm of yon wild sea 
The sunshine of the April skies 
But never more to thee 
 
 Oh would that love had power to raise 
A little isle for us alone 
With fairy flowers and sunny rays 
The blue sea wave its guardian zone  
No other step should ever press 
This hidden Eden of the heart 
And we would share its loveliness 
From every other thing apart  
The rose and violet should weep 
Wheneer our leafy couch was laid 
The lark should wake our morning sleep 
The bulbul sing our serenade  
And we would watch the starry hours 
And call the moon to hear our vows 
And we would cull the sweetest flowers 
And twine fresh chaplets for our brows  
 
 
I thought thus of the flowers the moon 
This fairy isle for you and me 
And then I thought how very soon 
How very tired we should be 
 
                   Matrimonial Creed 
HE must be rich whom I could love 
His fortune clear must be 
Whether in land or in the funds 
Tis all the same to me  
He must be old whom I could love 
Then hell not plague me long 
In sooth twill he a pleasant sight
To see him borne along 
To where the croaking ravens lurk 
And where the earth worms dwell 
A widows hood will suit my face
And black becomes me well  
And he must make a settlement 
Ill have no man without 
And when he writes his testament 
He must not leave me out  
Oh such a man as this would suit 
Each wish I here express 
If he should say   Will you have me 
Ill very soon say   Yes ⁠
