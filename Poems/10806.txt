hung in my mindWhen I had left him many a mile behind All he said was “Nobody can’t stop ’ee  It’sA footpath right enough  You see those bitsOf mounds that’s where they opened up the barrowsSixty years since while I was scaring sparrows They thought as there was something to find thereBut couldn’t find it by digging anywhere ”To turn back then and seek him where was the useThere were three Manningfords Abbots Bohun and BruceAnd whether Alton not Manningford it wasMy memory could not decide becauseThere was both Alton Barnes and Alton Priors All had their churches graveyards farms and byresLurking to one side up the paths and lanesSeldom well seen except by aeroplanesAnd when bells rang or pigs squealed or cocks crowedThen only heard  Ages ago the roadApproached  The people stood and looked and turned Nor asked it to come nearer nor yet learnedTo move out there and dwell in all men’s dust And yet withal they shot the weathercock justBecause ’twas he crowed out of tune they saidSo now the copper weathercock is dead If they had reaped their dandelions and soldThem fairly they could have afforded gold Many years passed and I went back againAmong those villages and looked for menWho might have known my ancient  He himselfHad long been dead or laid upon the shelfI thought  One man I asked about him roaredAt my description “’Tis old BottlesfordHe means Bill ” But another said “Of courseIt was Jack Button up at the White Horse He’s dead sir these three years ” This lasted tillA girl proposed Walker of Walker’s Hill“Old Adam Walker  Adams Point you’ll seeMarked on the maps ”                                 “That was her roguery”The next man said  He was a squire’s sonWho loved wild bird and beast and dog and gunFor killing them  He had loved them from his birthOne with another as he loved the earth “The man may be like Button or Walker orLike Bottlesford that you want but far moreHe sounds like one I saw when I was a child I could almost swear to him  The man was wildAnd wandered  His home was where he was free Everybody has met one such man as he Does he keep clear old paths that no one usesBut once a lifetime when he loves or musesHe is English as this gate these flowers this mire And when at eight years old Lob-lie-by-the-fireCame in my books this was the man I saw He has been in England as long as dove and dawCalling the wild cherry tree the merry treeThe rose campion Bridget-in-her-braveryAnd in a tender mood he as I guessChristened one flower Love-in-idlenessAnd while he walked from Exeter to LeedsOne April called all cuckoo-flowers Milkmaids From him old herbal Gerard learnt as a boyTo name wild clematis the Traveller’s-joy Our blackbirds sang no English till his earTold him they called his Jan Toy ‘Pretty dear ’She was Jan Toy the Lucky who having lostA shilling and found a penny loaf rejoiced For reasons of his own to him the wrenIs Jenny Pooter  Before all other men’Twas he first called the Hog’s Back the Hog’s Back That Mother Dunch’s Buttocks should not lackTheir name was his care  He too could explainTotteridge and Totterdown and Juggler’s LaneHe knows if anyone  Why Tumbling BayInland in Kent is called so he might say “But little he says compared with what he does If ever a sage troubles him he will buzzLike a beehive to conclude the tedious frayAnd the sage who knows all languages runs away Yet Lob has thirteen hundred names for a foolAnd though he never could spare time for schoolTo unteach what the fox so well expressedOn biting the cock’s head off Quietness is best He can talk quite as well as anyoneAfter his thinking is forgot and done He first of all told someone else’s wifeFor a farthing she’d skin a flint and spoil a knifeWorth sixpence skinning it  She heard him speak‘She had a face as long as a wet week’Said he telling the tale in after years With blue smock and with gold rings in his earsSometimes he is a pedlar not too poorTo keep his wit  This is tall Tom that boreThe logs in and with Shakespeare in the hallOnce talked when icicles hung by the wall As Herne the Hunter he has known hard times On sleepless nights he made up weather rhymesWhich others spoilt  And Hob being then his nameHe kept the hog that thought the butcher cameTo bring his breakfast ‘You thought wrong’ said Hob When there were kings in Kent this very LobWhose sheep grew fat and he himself grew merryWedded the king’s daughter of CanterburyFor he alone unlike squire lord and kingWatched a night by her without slumberingHe kept both waking  When he was but a ladHe won a rich man’s heiress deaf dumb and sadBy rousing her to laugh at him  He carriedHis donkey on his back  So they were married And while he was a little cobbler’s boyHe tricked the giant coming to destroyShrewsbury by flood  ‘And how far is it yet’The giant asked in passing  ‘I forgetBut see these shoes I‘ve worn out on the roadAnd we’re not there yet ’ He emptied out his loadOf shoes for mending  The giant let fall from his spadeThe earth for damming Severn and thus madeThe Wrekin hill and little Ercall hillRose where the giant scraped his boots  While stillSo young our Jack was chief of Gotham’s sages But long before he could have been wise agesEarlier than this while he grew thick and strongAnd ate his bacon or at times sang a songAnd merely smelt it as Jack the giant-killerHe made a name  He too ground up the millerThe Yorkshireman who ground men’s bones for flour “Do you believe Jack dead before his hourOr that his name is Walker or BottlesfordOr Button a mere clown or squire or lordThe man you saw Lob-lie-by-the-fire Jack CadeJack Smith Jack Moon poor Jack of every tradeYoung Jack or old Jack or Jack What-d’ye-callJack-in-the-hedge or Robin-run-by-the-wallRobin Hood Ragged Robin lazy BobOne of the lords of No Man’s Land good Lob Although he was seen dying at WaterlooHastings Agincourt and Sedgemoor too Lives yet  He never will admit he is deadTill millers cease to grind men’s bones for breadNot till our weathercock crows once againAnd I remove my house out of the laneOn to the road ” With this he disappearedIn hazel and thorn tangled with old-man’s-beard But one glimpse of his back as there he stoodChoosing his way proved him of old Jack’s bloodYoung Jack perhaps and now a WiltshiremanAs he has oft been since his days began
