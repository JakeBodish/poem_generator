It wasnt bliss  What was bliss  but the ordinary life Shed spend hours  in patter moving through whole days  touching sniffing tasting       exquisite  housekeeping in a charmed world   And yet there was always  more of the same all that happiness  the aimless Being There   So she wandered for a while bush to arbor  lingered to look through a ponds restive mirror   He was off cataloging the universe probably  pretending he could organize  what was clearly someone elses chaos   Thats when she found the tree  the dark crabbed branches  bearing up such speechless bounty  she knew without being told  this was forbidden  It wasnt  a question of ownership   who could lay claim to  such maddening perfection  And there was no voice in her head  no whispered intelligence lurking  in the leaves just an ache that grew  until she knew shed already lost everything  except desire the red heft of it  warming her outstretched palm
