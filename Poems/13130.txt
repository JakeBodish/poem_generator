on Eve So little here nay lost but Eve was Eve This far his over-match who self deceivd And rash before-hand had no better weighd The strength he was to cope with or his own But as a man who had been matchless held In cunning over-reacht where least he thought To salve his credit and for very spight Still will be tempting him who foyls him still And never cease though to his shame the more Or as a swarm of flies in vintage time About the wine-press where sweet moust is powrd Beat off returns as oft with humming sound Or surging waves against a solid rock Though all to shivers dasht the assault renew Vain battry and in froth or bubbles end So Satan whom repulse upon repulse Met ever and to shameful silence brought Yet gives not ore though desperate of success And his vain importunity pursues  He brought our Saviour to the western side Of that high mountain whence he might behold Another plain long but in bredth not wide Washd by the Southern Sea and on the North To equal length backd with a ridge of hills That screend the fruits of the earth and seats of men From cold Septentrion blasts thence in the midst Divided by a river of whose banks On each side an Imperial City stood With Towers and Temples proudly elevate On seven small Hills with Palaces adornd Porches and Theatres Baths Aqueducts Statues and Trophees and Triumphal Arcs Gardens and Groves presented to his eyes Above the highth of Mountains interposd  By what strange Parallax or Optic skill Of vision multiplyed through air or glass Of Telescope were curious to enquire And now the Tempter thus his silence broke     The City which thou seest no other deem Then great and glorious Rome Queen of the Earth So far renownd and with the spoils enricht Of Nations there the Capitol thou seest Above the rest lifting his stately head On the Tarpeian rock her Cittadel Impregnable and there Mount Palatine The Imperial Palace compass huge and high The Structure skill of noblest Architects With gilded battlements conspicuous far Turrets and Terrases and glittering Spires  Many a fair Edifice besides more like Houses of Gods so well I have disposd My Aerie Microscope thou mayst behold Outside and inside both pillars and roofs Carvd work the hand of famd Artificers In Cedar Marble Ivory or Gold  Thence to the gates cast round thine eye and see What conflux issuing forth or entring in Pretors Proconsuls to thir Provinces Hasting or on return in robes of State Lictors and rods the ensigns of thir power Legions and Cohorts turmes of horse and wings Or Embassies from Regions far remote In various habits on the Appian road Or on the Æmilian some from farthest South Syene and where the shadow both way falls Meroe Nilotic Isle and more to West The Realm of Bocchus to the Black-moor Sea From the Asian Kings and Parthian among these From India and the golden Chersoness And utmost Indian Isle Taprobane Dusk faces with white silken Turbants wreathd From Gallia Gades and the Brittish West Germans and Scythians and Sarmatians North Beyond Danubius to the Tauric Pool  All Nations now to Rome obedience pay To Romes great Emperour whose wide domain In ample Territory wealth and power Civility of Manners Arts and Arms And long Renown thou justly mayst prefer Before the Parthian these two Thrones except The rest are barbarous and scarce worth the sight Shard among petty Kings too far removd These having shewn thee I have shewn thee all The Kingdoms of the world and all thir glory  This Emperour hath no Son and now is old Old and lascivious and from Rome retird To Capreæ an Island small but strong On the Campanian shore with purpose there His horrid lusts in private to enjoy Committing to a wicked Favourite All publick cares and yet of him suspicious Hated of all and hating with what ease Indud with Regal Vertues as thou art Appearing and beginning noble deeds Mightst thou expel this monster from his Throne Now made a stye and in his place ascending A victor people free from servile yoke And with my help thou mayst to me the power Is given and by that right I give it thee  Aim therefore at no less then all the world Aim at the highest without the highest attaind Will be for thee no sitting or not long On Davids Throne be prophecid what will     To whom the Son of God unmovd replyd  Nor doth this grandeur and majestic show Of luxury though calld magnificence More then of arms before allure mine eye Much less my mind though thou shouldst add to tell Thir sumptuous gluttonies and gorgeous feasts On Cittron tables or Atlantic stone For I have also heard perhaps have read Their wines of Setia Cales and Falerne Chios and Creet and how they quaff in Gold Crystal and Myrrhine cups imbossd with Gems And studs of Pearl to me shouldst tell who thirst And hunger still then Embassies thou shewst From Nations far and nigh what honour that But tedious wast of time to sit and hear So many hollow complements and lies Outlandish flatteries then proceedst to talk Of the Emperour how easily subdud How gloriously I shall thou sayst expel A brutish monster what if I withal Expel a Devil who first made him such Let his tormenter Conscience find him out For him I was not sent nor yet to free That people victor once now vile and base Deservedly made vassal who once just Frugal and mild and temperate conquerd well But govern ill the Nations under yoke Peeling thir Provinces exhausted all By lust and rapine first ambitious grown Of triumph that insulting vanity Then cruel by thir sports to blood enurd Of fighting beasts and men to beasts exposd Luxurious by thir wealth and greedier still And from the daily Scene effeminate  What wise and valiant man would seek to free These thus degenerate by themselves enslavd Or could of inward slaves make outward free Know therefore when my season comes to sit On Davids Throne it shall be like a tree Spreading and over-shadowing all the Earth Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash All Monarchies besides throughout the world And of my Kingdom there shall be no end Means there shall be to this but what the means Is not for thee to know nor me to tell     To whom the Tempter impudent replid  I see all offers made by me how slight Thou valust because offerd and rejectst Nothing will please the difficult and nice Or nothing more then still to contradict On the other side know also thou that I On what I offer set as high esteem Nor what I part with mean to give for naught All these which in a moment thou beholdst The Kingdoms of the world to thee I give For givn to me I give to whom I please No trifle yet with this reserve not else On this condition if thou wilt fall down And worship me as thy superior Lord Easily done and hold them all of me For what can less so great a gift deserve    Whom thus our Saviour answerd with disdain  I never likd thy talk thy offers less Now both abhor since thou hast dard to utter The abominable terms impious condition But I endure the time till which expird Thou hast permission on me    It is written The first of all Commandments Thou shalt worship The Lord thy God and only him shalt serve And darst thou to the Son of God propound To worship thee accurst now more accurst For this attempt bolder then that on Eve And more blasphemous which expect to rue  The Kingdoms of the world to thee were givn Permitted rather and by thee usurpt Other donation none thou canst produce If given by whom but by the King of Kings God over all supreme if givn to thee By thee how fairly is the Giver now Repaid   But gratitude in thee is lost Long since    Wert thou so void of fear or shame As offer them to me the Son of God To me my own on such abhorred pact That I fall down and worship thee as God Get thee behind me plain thou now appearst That Evil one Satan for ever damnd     To whom the Fiend with fear abasht replyd  Be not so sore offended Son of God Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men If I to try whether in higher sort Then these thou bearst that title have proposd What both from Men and Angels I receive Tetrarchs of fire air flood and on the earth Nations besides from all the quarterd winds God of this world invokt and world beneath Who then thou art whose coming is foretold To me so fatal me it most concerns  The tryal hath indamagd thee no way Rather more honour left and more esteem Me naught advantagd missing what I aimd  Therefore let pass as they are transitory The Kingdoms of this world I shall no more Advise thee gain them as thou canst or not  And thou thy self seemst otherwise inclind Then to a worldly Crown addicted more To contemplation and profound dispute As by that early action may be judgd When slipping from thy Mothers eye thou wentst Alone into the Temple there was found Among the gravest Rabbies disputant On points and questions fitting Moses Chair Teaching not taught the childhood shews the man As morning shews the day    Be famous then By wisdom as thy Empire must extend So let extend thy mind ore all the world In knowledge all things in it comprehend All knowledge is not coucht in Moses Law The Pentateuch or what the Prophets wrote The Gentiles also know and write and teach To admiration led by Natures light And with the Gentiles much thou must converse Ruling them by perswasion as thou meanst Without thir learning how wilt thou with them Or they with thee hold conversation meet How wilt

think I know them not not therefore am I short Of knowing what I aught he who receives Light from above from the fountain of light No other doctrine needs though granted true But these are false or little else but dreams Conjectures fancies built on nothing firm  The first and wisest of them all professd To know this only that he nothing knew The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits A third sort doubted all things though plain sence Others in vertue placd felicity But vertue joynd with riches and long life In corporal pleasure he and careless ease The Stoic last in Philosophic pride By

life Which when he lists he leaves or boasts he can For all his tedious talk is but vain boast Or subtle shifts conviction to evade  Alas what can they teach and not mislead Ignorant of themselves of God much more And how the world began and how man fell Degraded by himself on grace depending Much of the Soul they talk but all awrie And in themselves seek vertue and to themselves All glory arrogate to God give none Rather accuse him under usual names Fortune and Fate as one regardless quite Of mortal things    Who therefore seeks in these True wisdom finds her not or by delusion Far worse her false resemblance only meets An empty cloud    However many books Wise men have said are wearisom who reads Incessantly and to his reading brings not A spirit and judgment equal or superior And what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek Uncertain and unsettld still remains Deep verst in books and shallow in himself Crude or intoxicate collecting toys And trifles for choice matters worth

Story strewd With Hymns our Psalms with artful terms inscribd Our Hebrew Songs and Harps in Babylon That pleasd so well our Victors ear declare That rather Greece from us these Arts derivd Ill

Godlike men The Holiest of Holies and his Saints Such are from God inspird not such from thee Unless where moral vertue is expresst By light of Nature not in all quite lost  Thir Orators thou then extollst as those The top of Eloquence Statists indeed And lovers of thir Country as may seem But herein to our Prophets far beneath As men divinely taught and better teaching The solid rules of Civil Government In thir majestic unaffected stile Then all the Oratory of Greece and Rome  In them is plainest taught and easiest learnt What makes a Nation happy and keeps it so What ruins Kingdoms and lays Cities flat These only with our Law best form a King     So spake the Son of God but Satan now Quite at a loss for all his darts were spent Thus to our Saviour with stern brow replyd     Since neither wealth nor honour arms nor arts Kingdom nor Empire pleases thee nor aught By me proposd in life contemplative Or active tended on by glory or fame What dost thou in this World the Wilderness For thee is fittest place I found thee there And thither will return thee yet remember What I foretell thee soon thou shalt have cause To wish thou never hadst rejected thus Nicely or cautiously my offerd aid Which would have set thee in short time with ease On Davids Throne or Throne of all the world Now at full age fulness of time thy season When Prophesies of thee are best fullfilld  Now contrary if I read aught in Heaven Or Heavn write aught of Fate by what the Stars Voluminous or single characters In their conjunction met give me to spell Sorrows and labours opposition hate Attends thee scorns reproaches injuries Violence and stripes and lastly cruel death A Kingdom they portend thee but what Kingdom Real or Allegoric I discern not Nor when eternal sure as without end Without beginning for no date prefixt Directs me in the Starry Rubric set     So saying he took for still he knew his power Not yet expird and to the Wilderness Brought back the Son of God and left him there Feigning to disappear    Darkness now rose As day-light sunk and brought in lowring night Her shadowy off-spring unsubstantial both Privation meer of light and absent day  Our Saviour meek and with untroubld mind After his aerie jaunt though hurried sore Hungry and cold betook him to his rest Wherever under some concourse of shades Whose branching arms thick intertwind might shield From dews and damps of night his shelterd head But shelterd slept in vain for at his head The Tempter watchd and soon with ugly dreams Disturbd his sleep and either Tropic now Gan thunder and both ends of Heavn the Clouds From many a horrid rift abortive pourd Fierce rain with lightning mixt water with fire In ruine reconcild nor slept the winds Within thir stony caves but rushd abroad From the four hinges of the world and fell On the vext Wilderness whose tallest Pines Though rooted deep as high and sturdiest Oaks Bowd their Stiff necks loaden with stormy blasts Or torn up sheer ill wast thou shrouded then O patient Son of God yet only stoodst Unshaken nor yet staid the terror there Infernal Ghosts and Hellish Furies round Environd thee some howld some yelld some shriekd Some bent at thee thir fiery darts while thou Satst unappalld in calm and sinless peace  Thus passd the night so foul till morning fair Came forth with Pilgrim steps in amice gray Who with her radiant finger stilld the roar Of thunder chasd the clouds and laid the winds And grisly Spectres which the Fiend had raisd To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire  And now the Sun with more effectual beams Had cheard the face of Earth and dryd the wet From drooping plant or dropping tree the birds Who all things now behold more fresh and green After a night of storm so ruinous Cleard up their choicest notes in bush and spray To gratulate the sweet return of morn Nor yet amidst this joy and brightest morn Was absent after all his mischief done The Prince of darkness glad would also seem Of this fair change and to our Saviour came Yet with no new device they all were spent Rather by this his last affront resolvd Desperate of better course to vent his rage And mad despight to be so oft repelld  Him walking on a Sunny hill he found Backd on the North and West by a thick wood Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape And in a careless mood thus to him said     Fair morning yet betides thee Son of God After a dismal night I heard the rack As Earth and Skie would mingle but my self Was distant and these flaws though mortals fear them As dangerous to the pillard frame of Heaven Or to the Earths dark basis underneath Are to the main as inconsiderable And harmless if not wholsom as a sneeze To mans less universe and soon are gone Yet as being oft times noxious where they light On man beast plant wastful and turbulent Like turbulencies in the affairs of men Over whose heads they rore and seem to point They oft fore-signifie and threaten ill This Tempest at this Desert most was bent Of men at thee for only thou here dwellst  Did I not tell thee if thou didst reject The perfet season offerd with my aid To win thy destind seat but wilt prolong All to the push of Fate persue thy way Of gaining Davids Throne no man knows when For both the when and how is no where told Thou shalt be what thou art ordaind no doubt For Angels have proclaimd it but concealing The time and means each act is rightliest done Not when it must but when it may be best  If thou observe not this be sure to find What I foretold thee many a hard assay Of dangers and adversities and pains Ere thou of Israels Scepter get fast hold Whereof this ominous night that closd thee round So many terrors voices prodigies May warn thee as a sure fore-going sign     So talkd he while the Son of God went on And staid not but in brief him answerd thus     Mee worse then wet thou findst not other harm Those terrors which thou speakst of did me none I never feard they could though noising loud And threatning nigh what they can do as signs Betokning or ill boding I contemn As false portents not sent from God but thee Who knowing I shall raign past thy preventing Obtrudst thy offerd aid that I accepting At least might seem to hold all power of thee Ambitious spirit and wouldst be thought my God And stormst refusd thinking to terrifie Mee to thy will desist thou art discernd And toilst in vain nor me in vain molest     To whom the Fiend now swoln with rage replyd Then hear O Son of David Virgin-born For Son of God to me is yet in doubt Of the Messiah I have heard foretold By all the Prophets of thy birth at length Announct by Gabriel with the first I knew And of the Angelic Song in Bethlehem field On thy birth-night that sung thee Saviour born  From that time seldom have I ceasd to eye Thy infancy thy childhood and thy youth Thy manhood last though yet in private bred Till at the Ford of Jordan whither all Flockd to the Baptist I among the rest Though not to be Baptizd by voice from Heavn Heard thee pronouncd the Son of God belovd  Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view And narrower Scrutiny that I might learn In what degree or meaning thou art calld The Son of God which bears no single sence The Son of God I also am or was And if I was I am relation stands All men are Sons of God yet thee I thought In some respect far higher so declard  Therefore I watchd thy footsteps from that hour And followd thee still on to this wast wild Where by all best conjectures I collect Thou art to be my fatal enemy  Good reason then if I before-hand seek To understand my Adversary who And what he is his wisdom power intent By parl or composition truce or league To win him or win from him what I can  And opportunity I here have had To try thee sift thee and confess have found thee Proof against all temptation as a rock Of Adamant and as a Center firm To the utmost of meer man both wise and good Not more for Honours Riches Kingdoms Glory Have been before contemnd and may agen Therefore to know what more thou art then man Worth naming Son of God by voice from Heavn Another method I must now begin     So saying he caught him up and without wing Of Hippogrif bore through the Air sublime Over the Wilderness and ore the Plain Till underneath them fair Jerusalem The holy City lifted high her Towers And higher yet the glorious Temple reard Her pile far off appearing like a Mount Of Alabaster topt with Golden Spires There on the highest Pinacle he set The Son of God and added thus in scorn    There stand if thou wilt stand to stand upright Will ask thee skill I to thy Fathers house Have brought thee and highest plact highest is best Now shew thy Progeny if not to stand Cast thy self down safely if Son of God For it is written He will give command Concerning thee to his Angels in thir hands They shall up lift thee lest at any time Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone     To whom thus Jesus also it is written Tempt not the Lord thy God he said and stood  But Satan smitten with amazement fell As when Earths Son Antæus to compare Small things with greatest in Irassa strove With Joves Alcides and oft foild still rose Receiving from his mother Earth new strength Fresh from his fall and fiercer grapple joynd Throttld at length in the Air expird and fell So after many a foil the Tempter proud Renewing fresh assaults amidst his pride Fell whence he stood to see his Victor fall  And as that Theban Monster that proposd Her riddle and him who solvd it not devourd That once found out and solvd for grief and spight Cast her self headlong from th Ismenian steep So strook with dread and anguish fell the Fiend And to his crew that sat consulting brought Joyless triumphals of his hopt success Ruin and desperation and dismay Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God  So Satan fell and strait a fiery Globe Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh Who on their plumy Vans receivd him soft From his uneasie station and upbore As on a floating couch through the blithe Air Then in a flowry valley set him down On a green bank and set before him spred A table of Celestial Food Divine Ambrosial Fruits fetcht from the tree of life And from the fount of life Ambrosial drink That soon refreshd him wearied and repaird What hunger if aught hunger had impaird Or thirst and as he fed Angelic Quires Sung Heavenly Anthems of his victory Over temptation and the Tempter proud     True Image of the Father whether thrond In the bosom of bliss and light of light Conceiving or remote from Heaven enshrind In fleshly Tabernacle and human form Wandring the Wilderness whatever place

In Paradise to tempt his snares are broke For though that seat of earthly bliss be faild A fairer Paradise is founded now For Adam and his chosen Sons whom thou A Saviour art come down to re-install  Where they shall dwell secure when time shall be Of Tempter and Temptation without fear  But thou Infernal Serpent shalt not long Rule in the Clouds like an Autumnal Star Or Lightning thou shalt fall from Heavn trod down Under his feet for proof ere this thou feelst Thy wound yet not thy last and deadliest wound By this repulse receivd and holdst in Hell No triumph in all her gates Abaddon rues Thy bold attempt hereafter learn with awe To dread the Son of God he all unarmd Shall chase thee with the terror of his voice From thy Demoniac holds possession foul Thee and thy Legions yelling they
