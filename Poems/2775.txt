
I hardly know where to look
anymore  Places have a
putrid familiarity
like the smell of my own sheets
or the close air of the kitchen  
fishbones on the drain
left in the ghastly order
of temporal things I have been sitting in this barfor years nowthe beer is stale the wine off-colorthe music is always the sameold sad songs that get olderno better than endless conversationnight after forgotten nightwhen all I or you can recallis the dark the traffic lightsthe bartenders commentsabout drunk womenin public places I would like to go homefinally down the long streetsnorth and south crossed with small gold leavesI forget just where the hellanything is  Locked out
