I didn’t want to scold the sky that year but
 Grandma’s words taunted my senses  If there
is a thirst then you need to pity the flowers
 
in a loud voice  Ask the frogs why they are
being punished stomp on the ground and talk
to the dried clay about cracking open the earth 
 
I know challenging the storm is risky  “Last
but not least burn cedar and pray the lightning
doesn’t strike your town ” That night the stars
 
disappeared so did the birds  Perhaps it was
the season for rain or the dance  In the western
distance we thought we heard cannon blasts
 
looking over we watched the horizon fill with
lightning strikes  Rain couldn’t pour hard enough
over the thirsty plain  Accompanying clouds
 
called to thunder’s voice in extreme decimals
requesting all the water heaven could send forth
to come  Rain and more rain filled empty stream
 
bottoms  Rivers who had pulled their dry banks
farther and farther from their center begged for
a drink to startle dusty beds with a flooding roar 
 
Lives in dormant places begin to stir and awaken 
 The lives of water beings those that swim the
ones that hop and the ones that fly begin to stir 
 
That year all thirst was quenched
