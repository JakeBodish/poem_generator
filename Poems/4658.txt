Light falls from her voice
and I try to catch it as the last
light of the day fades    
But there is no form to touch
no pain to trace 
2
Are dreams
taking their seats
on the night train
3
She recites a list of wishes
to keep him from dying 
4
The truth lands like a kiss 
sometimes like a mosquito
sometimes like a lantern 
5
Your coffee-colored skin
awakens me to the world 
6
We have only one minute
and I love you 
7
All children are poets
until they quit the habit
of reaching for butterflies
that are not there 
8
The moment you thought you lost me
you saw me clearly
with all of my flowers
even the dried ones 
9
If you pronounce all letters
and vowels at once
you would hear their names
falling drop by drop
with the rain 
10
We carved
our ancestral trees into boats 
The boats sailed into harbors
that looked safe from afar 
11
Trees talk to each other
like old friends
and don’t like to be interrupted 
They follow anyone who
cuts one of them
turning that person
into a lonely cut branch 
Is this why in Arabic
we say “cut of a tree”
when we mean
“having no one”
12
The way roots hide
under trees 
there are secrets
faces and wind
behind the colors
in Rothko’s untitled canvases 
13
Will the sea forget its waves
as caves forgot us
14
Back when there was no language
they walked until sunset
carrying red leaves
like words to remember 
15
It’s true that pain
is like air available
everywhere
but we each feel
our pain hurts the most 
16
So many of them died
under stars
that don’t know their names 
17
If she just survived with me 
18
A flame dims in the fireplace
a day slips quietly away from the calendar
and Fairuz sings “They say love kills time
and they also say time kills love ”
19
The street vendor offers tourists
necklaces with divided hearts
seashells to murmur the sea’s secrets in your ear
squishy balls to make you feel better
maps of homelands you fold
in your pocket as you go on your way 
20
I am haunted by the melody
of a forgotten song
sung while two hands
tied my shoelaces into a ribbon
and waved me goodbye to school 
21
If I could photocopy
the moment we met
I would find it full
of all the days and nights 
22
It won’t forget the faraway child
that city whose door stayed open
for passersby tourists and invaders 
23
The moon is going to the other
side of the world
to call my loved ones 
24
The seasons change
colors and you come and go 
What color is your departure
