
The hastily assembled angel wandered
The desert hidden in      the pillar of
Cloud in the day      and in the pillar of
Fire in the night      and as he wandered he
Asked himself whether      sometimes as he wandered
He asked himself      whether he really could
Be said to wander      since he after all
Could see through time      which was even better for
Seeing where he was going than seeing      through space
In the day he was a darkness in the cloud
Like rain      and in the night he was a darkness
In the fire      like God      and day and night he won-
dered why he had been given gifts even God
Hadn’t been given or no even God      had-
n’t given Themselves or no no even      God did-
n’t have and who he wondered ever could
Give God a gift      except he knew he was
Allowed to see through time because he was
Not God      and could be wrong      and saw through time
With many-chambered eyes      all things that might be
And God would see      only the one thing that wouldIs that the one gift      he wondered      That free people
Give God uncertainty
