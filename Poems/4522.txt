
I know something about godforsaken places 
Walking on the beach alone far from the Dead Sea
I thought I saw a horseshoe crab crawling slowly 
it was a Gideon Society black Bible cover 
Another time washed up on a Montauk dune
I found a Chianti wine bottle
with a letter in it  I read to myself
a child’s handwriting “Hello
let’s make friends  Please call” she gave her phone number 
I held the bottle a week before calling then asked
for Mary Jane in my best Portuguese accentI am Pessoa  I’m calling from Por-tu-gal 
I’ll be your friend
