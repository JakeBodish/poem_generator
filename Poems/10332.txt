
An old man going a lone highwayCame at the evening cold and grayTo a chasm vast and deep and wide Through which was flowing a sullen tideThe old man crossed in the twilight dimThe sullen stream had no fear for himBut he turned when safe on the other sideAnd built a bridge to span the tide “Old man” said a fellow pilgrim near“You are wasting your strength with building hereYour journey will end with the ending dayYou never again will pass this wayYou’ve crossed the chasm deep and wideWhy build this bridge at evening tide”The builder lifted his old gray head“Good friend in the path I have come” he said“There followed after me to-dayA youth whose feet must pass this way This chasm that has been as naught to meTo that fair-haired youth may a pitfall beHe too must cross in the twilight dimGood friend I am building this bridge for him”
