
How changed is here each spot man makes or fills
    In the two Hinkseys nothing keeps the same
         The village street its haunted mansion lacks
    And from the sign is gone Sibyllas name
         And from the roofs the twisted chimney-stacks 
              Are ye too changed ye hills
    See tis no foot of unfamiliar men
         To-night from Oxford up your pathway strays
         Here came I often often in old days 
    Thyrsis and I we still had Thyrsis then Runs it not here the track by Childsworth Farm
    Past the high wood to where the elm-tree crowns
         The hill behind whose ridge the sunset flames
    The signal-elm that looks on Ilsley Downs
         The Vale the three lone weirs the youthful Thames 
              This winter-eve is warm
    Humid the air leafless yet soft as spring
         The tender purple spray on copse and briers
         And that sweet city with her dreaming spires
    She needs not June for beautys heighteningLovely all times she lies lovely to-night 
    Only methinks some loss of habits power
         Befalls me wandering through this upland dim 
    Once passd I blindfold here at any hour
         Now seldom come I since I came with him 
              That single elm-tree bright
    Against the west I miss it is it goner
         We prized it dearly while it stood we said
         Our friend the Gipsy-Scholar was not dead
    While the tree lived he in these fields lived on Too rare too rare grow now my visits here
    But once I knew each field each flower each stick
         And with the country-folk acquaintance made
    By barn in threshing-time by new-built rick 
         Here too our shepherd-pipes we first assayd 
              Ah me this many a year
    My pipe is lost my shepherds holiday
         Needs must I lose them needs with heavy heart
         Into the world and wave of men depart
    But Thyrsis of his own will went away It irkd him to be here he could not rest 
    He loved each simple joy the country yields
         He loved his mates but yet he could not keep
    For that a shadow lourd on the fields
         Here with the shepherds and the silly sheep 
              Some life of men unblest
    He knew which made him droop and filld his head 
         He went his piping took a troubled sound
         Of storms that rage outside our happy ground
    He could not wait their passing he is dead So some tempestuous morn in early June
    When the years primal burst of bloom is oer
         Before the roses and the longest day 
    When garden-walks and all the grassy floor
         With blossoms red and white of fallen May
              And chestnut-flowers are strewn 
    So have I heard the cuckoos parting cry
         From the wet field through the vext garden-trees
         Come with the volleying rain and tossing breezeThe bloom is gone and with the bloom go I Too quick despairer wherefore wilt thou go
    Soon will the high Midsummer pomps come on
         Soon will the musk carnations break and swell
    Soon shall we have gold-dusted snapdragon
         Sweet-William with his homely cottage-smell
              And stocks in fragrant blow
    Roses that down the alleys shine afar
         And open jasmine-muffled lattices
         And groups under the dreaming garden-trees
    And the full moon and the white evening-star He hearkens not light comer he is flown
    What matters it next year he will return
         And we shall have him in the sweet spring-days
    With whitening hedges and uncrumpling fern
         And blue-bells trembling by the forest-ways
              And scent of hay new-mown 
    But Thyrsis never more we swains shall see
         See him come back and cut a smoother reed
         And blow a strain the world at last shall heed 
    For Time not Corydon hath conquerd theeAlack for Corydon no rival now 
    But when Sicilian shepherds lost a mate
         Some good survivor with his flute would go
    Piping a ditty sad for Bions fate
         And cross the unpermitted ferrys flow
              And relax Plutos brow
    And make leap up with joy the beauteous head
         Of Proserpine among whose crowned hair
         Are flowers first opend on Sicilian air
    And flute his friend like Orpheus from the dead O easy access to the hearers grace
    When Dorian shepherds sang to Proserpine
         For she herself had trod Sicilian fields
    She knew the Dorian waters gush divine
         She knew each lily white which Enna yields
              Each rose with blushing face
    She loved the Dorian pipe the Dorian strain 
         But ah of our poor Thames she never heard
         Her foot the Cumner cowslips never stirrd
    And we should tease her with our plaint in vain
    Well wind-dispersed and vain the words will be
         Yet Thyrsis let me give my grief its hour
         In the old haunt and find our tree-toppd hill
    Who if not I for questing here hath power
         I know the wood which hides the daffodil
              I know the Fyfield tree
    I know what white what purple fritillaries
         The grassy harvest of the river-fields
         Above by Ensham down by Sandford yields
    And what sedged brooks are Thamess tributariesI know these slopes who knows them if not I 
    But many a tingle on the loved hillside
         With thorns once studded old white-blossomd trees
    Where thick the cowslips grew and far descried
         High towerd the spikes of purple orchises
              Hath since our day put by
    The coronals of that forgotten time
         Down each green bank hath gone the ploughboys team
         And only in the hidden brookside gleam
    Primroses orphans of the flowery prime Where is the girl who by the boatmans door
    Above the locks above the boating throng
         Unmoord our skiff when through the Wytham flats
    Red loosestrife and blond meadow-sweet among
         And darting swallows and light water-gnats
              We trackd the shy Thames shore
    Where are the mowers who as the tiny swell
         Of our boat passing heaved the river-grass
         Stood with suspended scythe to see us pass 
    They all are gone and thou art gone as wellYes thou art gone and round me too the night
    In ever-nearing circle weaves her shade 
         I see her veil draw soft across the day
    I feel her slowly chilling breath invade
         The cheek grown thin the brown hair sprent with grey
              I feel her finger light
    Laid pausefully upon lifes headlong train  
         The foot less prompt to meet the morning dew
         The heart less bounding at emotion new
    And hope once crushd less quick to spring again And long the way appears which seemd so short
    To the less practised eye of sanguine youth
         And high the mountain-tops in cloudy air
    The mountain-tops where is the throne of Truth
         Tops in lifes morning-sun so bright and bare
              Unbreachable the fort
    Of the long-batterd world uplifts its wall
         And strange and vain the earthly turmoil grows
         And near and real the charm of thy repose
    And night as welcome as a friend would fall But hush the upland hath a sudden loss
    Of quiet Look adown the dusk hill-side
         A troop of Oxford hunters going home
    As in old days jovial and talking ride
         From hunting with the Berkshire hounds they come 
              Quick let me fly and cross
    Into yon farther field Tis done and see
         Backd by the sunset which doth glorify
         The orange and pale violet evening-sky
    Bare on its lonely ridge the Tree the TreeI take the omen Eve lets down her veil
    The white fog creeps from bush to bush about
         The west unflushes the high stars grow bright
    And in the scatterd farms the lights come out 
         I cannot reach the signal-tree to-night
              Yet happy omen hail
    Hear it from thy broad lucent Arno-vale
         For there thine earth forgetting eyelids keep
         The morningless and unawakening sleep
    Under the flowery oleanders paleHear it O Thyrsis still our tree is there 
    Ah vain These English fields this upland dim
         These brambles pale with mist engarlanded
    That lone sky-pointing tree are not for him
         To a boon southern country he is fled
              And now in happier air
    Wandering with the great Mothers train divine
         And purer or more subtle soul than thee
         I trow the mighty Mother doth not see
    Within a folding of the ApennineThou hearest the immortal chants of old 
    Putting his sickle to the perilous grain
         In the hot cornfield of the Phrygian king
    For thee the Lityerses-song again
         Young Daphnis with his silver voice doth sing
              Sings his Sicilian fold
    His sheep his hapless love his blinded eyes 
         And how a call celestial round him rang
         And heavenward from the fountain-brink he sprang
    And all the marvel of the golden skies There thou art gone and me thou leavest here
    Sole in these fields yet will I not despair 
         Despair I will not while I yet descry
    Neath the mild canopy of English air
         That lonely tree against the western sky 
              Still still these slopes tis clear
    Our Gipsy-Scholar haunts outliving thee
         Fields where soft sheep from cages pull the hay
         Woods with anemonies in flower till May
    Know him a wanderer still then why not meA fugitive and gracious light he seeks
    Shy to illumine and I seek it too 
         This does not come with houses or with gold
    With place with honour and a flattering crew
         Tis not in the worlds market bought and sold 
              But the smooth-slipping weeks
    Drop by and leave its seeker still untired
         Out of the heed of mortals he is gone
         He wends unfollowd he must house alone
    Yet on he fares by his own heart inspired Thou too O Thyrsis on like quest wast bound
    Thou wanderedst with me for a little hour
         Men gave thee nothing but this happy quest
    If men esteemd thee feeble gave thee power
         If men procured thee trouble gave thee rest 
              And this rude Cumner ground
    Its fir-topped Hurst its farms its quiet fields
         Here camst thou in thy jocund youthful time
         Here was thine height of strength thy golden prime
    And still the haunt beloved a virtue yields What though the music of thy rustic flute
    Kept not for long its happy country tone
         Lost it too soon and learnt a stormy note
    Of men contention-tost of men who groan
         Which taskd thy pipe too sore and tired thy throat 
              It faild and thou wage mute
    Yet hadst thou always visions of our light
         And long with men of care thou couldst not stay
         And soon thy foot resumed its wandering way
    Left human haunt and on alone till night Too rare too rare grow now my visits here
    Mid city-noise not as with thee of yore
         Thyrsis in reach of sheep-bells is my home 
     Then through the great towns harsh heart-wearying roar
         Let in thy voice a whisper often come
              To chase fatigue and fearWhy faintest thou I wanderd till I died   Roam on The light we sought is shining still   Dost thou ask proof Our tree yet crowns the hill  Our Scholar travels yet the loved hill-side
