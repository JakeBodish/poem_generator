I saw the shrouds of prisonerslike baptismal gownsburied outside the cemetery On the canvas frills exhaledsinged wool and cardboard The angels arrived as lace Took notes then stuck  Awful residuefrom a small cut                                  •The veil has been ripped from the skinwhere it was burned in The skin is the veil the baby-materialimprinted on as ifone dropped the handkerchiefand it was one’s wrist The cuff is frightening   Stuffed onto oil Water-stains might fence its ghost in                                  ﻿•“The barbed wire complex”I understand   Winged and flattenedat the same time poor thingsSome leftover specters of blood Remember Blake’s figures like columnswith headslooking around for GodWhen events are not as randomas they seem                                  ﻿•The article of clothingis only half there it’s not fullbut when it falls forward it is Terrible emptiness of the spreadneckline and little sleeve Half-cooked squares Was this religious fireand is this where it passedMaybe they are floating on waterof paint pool-sized blue and ridged like foam You would have to flyto see them flat as a map The rib and hem  Rained onfor eons  Noah’s children’sfloating forms                                  ﻿•Angels dieIt’s a frightening-miracle because here they are The Upper Godhas let them droplike centuries into space And I recognize them
