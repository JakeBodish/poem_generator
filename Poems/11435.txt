clindor Sir why so restless Is there any need  With all your fame for one more glorious deed  Have you not slain enough bold foes by now  And must you have fresh laurels for your brow matamore Its true Im restless and I cant decide  Which of two foes should first be nullified  The Mogul emperor or the Persian Sophy   clindor Ah let them live a while Sir  Neither trophy  Would add a great deal to your fame and standing   And wheres the army that youd be commanding  matamore Army Ah villain coward do you doubt  That with this arm alone Id wipe them out  The mere sound of my name makes ramparts yield  And drives divisions from the battlefield  My wrath against these rulers needs engage  Only a piddling portion of my rage  With one commandment given to the Fates  I oust the strongest monarchs from their states  Thunders my cannon my troops the Destinies  One blow lays low a thousand enemies  One breath and all their hopes go up in smoke   Yet you dare speak of armies What a joke  No longer shall a second Mars employ you With but a glance you rogue I shall destroy you          And yet the thought of her whom I adore  Softens me now and Im enraged no more  That little archer whom every God obeys  Forbids my eyes to glare with lethal rays   Observe how my ferocity which hates  And hacks and slaughters gently dissipates  When I recall my lady and my face  Is changed by thoughts of beauty love and grace   clindor Oh Sir you have a hundred selves or more  Youre as handsome now as you were grim before   I cant imagine any lady who  Could stubbornly refuse her heart to you   matamore Whatever I may have said feel no alarm  Sometimes I terrify sometimes I charm  Depending on my humor I inspire  Men with anxiety women with desire   Before I had the power to suppress My beauty women gave me much distress When I appeared they swooned in quantity  And thousands died each day for love of me   With every princess I had many a tryst  And every queen came begging to be kissed  The Ethiopian and the Japanese  Murmured my name in all their sighs and pleas   Two sultanesses could not but adore me  Two more escaped from the seraglio fòr me  Which strained my friendship with the Turkish nation   clindor Their anger could but gild your reputation   matamore Still all that was more trouble than it was worth   It balked my plans for conquering the earth   Whats more I tired of it and to deter  Such nuisances sent word to Jupiter  That if he could not put a stop to these  Fond women and their importunities  Id rise up in a rage and end his reign  As ruler of the Gods and would obtain  For Mars the right to throw his bolts of thunder   Needless to say the coward knuckled under  He did as I desired and now you see  Im handsome only when I choose to be   clindor What love notes youd receive were that not so matamore Dont bring me any               unless from her you know   What does she say of me  clindor                                                                          Today she said  That you inspire all hearts with love and dread  And that if what you promise her comes true  Shell feel herself a Goddess thanks to you   matamore Back in the times Ive just been speaking of  Goddesses also pestered me for love  And I shall tell you of a strange event  Which caused confusion without precedent  And threw all nature into disarray   The Sun was powerless to rise one day  Because that bright much-worshipped deity  Could not find where the Dawn his guide might be   He sought her everywhere in Cephalus bower  In old Tithonus bed in Memnons tower  But since Aurora nowhere was in sight  The day till noontide was as black as night   clindor Where was the Goddess during these alarms  matamore In my bedchamber offering me her charms   But she gained nothing by such shameless actions  My heart was blind to all her bright attractions  And all she got by showing off her beauty  Was a firm command to go and do her duty   clindor That curious story Sir I now recall   I was in Mexico where I heard it all   They said that Persia vexed by the insult to  Their famous Sun God had it in for you   matamore I heard as much and would have made them pay  But was in Transylvania that day  Where their ambassador hastened to appease  My wrath with presents and apologies   clindor Your brave heart showed them clemency  How fine matamore Just look my friend upon this face of mine   There every human virtue can be found   Of all the foes Ive stamped into the ground  Whose kingdoms are annulled and cast aside  There was not one who did not fall through pride   But those who humbly honored my perfection  Have kept their power through a wise subjection   The modest kings of Europe are all my vassals  I do not sack their towns or wreck their castles  I let them reign  But its another story  In Africa where I scorched the territory  Of certain kings who lacked humility  And left great deserts there for all to see   Those endless sands beneath those skies of fire  Are a great monument to my righteous ire   clindor Let us revert to love your ladys here   matamore My cursèd rivals at her side I fear   clindor Where are you going  matamore                                                     He isnt brave this dunce  And yet hes vain and could be bold for once   Perhaps hell challenge me from foolish pride  Merely because hes at the ladys side   clindor By doing so the fool might come to harm   matamore I cant be valorous when Im full of charm   clindor Cease to be charming and be terrible Sir   matamore Oh you dont realize what that would incur   I cant be terrible by halves you know  Id slaughter both my mistress and my foe   Until they part lets stand aside and wait   clindor Your prudence like your valor is very great   They withdraw to a corner
