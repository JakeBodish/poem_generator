
This is what our dying looks like 
You believe in the sun  I believe
I cant love you  Always be closing
Said our favorite professor before
He let the gun go off in his mouth 
I turned 29 the way any man turns
In his sleep unaware of the earth
Moving beneath him its plates in
Their places a dated disagreement 
Lets fight it out baby  You have
Only so long left a man turning
In his sleep so I take a picture 
I wont look at it of course  Its
His bad side his Mr  Hyde the hole
In a husbands head the O
Of his wifes mouth  Every night
I take a pill  Miss one and Im gone 
Miss two and were through  Hotels
Bore me unless I get a mountain view
A room in which my cell wont work
And theres nothing to do but see
The sun go down into the ground
That cradles us as any coffin can
