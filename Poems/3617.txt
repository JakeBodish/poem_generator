
You never asked to be a master
and God knows if She would only say so
that I never asked to be a slave 
Position papers grocery lists
rain down like ticker-tape on my long-march procession
past where you cheer me on
waving from the wistful side of lets admit it 
barricades 
Youre tired of living without any joy 
You think youre going crazy 
You need my friendship 
Youre afraid to demand the right
to be afraid 
Youre trying very hard 
I know that and you cant imagine
how I wish it were enough 
I need to sleep 
I never asked for this
you never asked 
Our twenty-five inch son
whimpers in the night
and my breasts hurt until I wake myself
and feed him 
He never asked for anything at all 
We all want just to be a little happy 
Listen I see an older me alone
in some room busy on the telephone
dialing all my terrible truths 
This thing has never let me live
as we both know I might have yet I see
this thing can cut me down
on some street or podium tomorrow 
or just let me live alone 
Our child looks back and forth
from your face into mine and laughs 
You worry about us wondering if
something within us has broken 
You hold my body as if it were glass
that will cut you 
Id stop this if I could believe me my beloved 
Im dying of bitterness 
I love your forehead 
Did I ever tell you that
