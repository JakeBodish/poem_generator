
It broke the dog’s leg
when you were reversing for me          on the slope at home Racing greenit sits for scrap now
on the tow truck 
Majestic as a king
on his lecticathe ratchets clickthe blue straps tightenbefore the final journeyout the gates
through which it oncefirst drove
purchased from our savingswhen we were toldwe were having twins 
Ground-in chocolate mud crumbs
infant seats all straps and bucklesthe roof rack bars were your horizontal
handles when you’d standand like the Hulk begin to shake
us when you’d come to say goodbye 
And the strapped-in children wouldshout as if they were about to be tipped
out and when you stopped their laughterturned to Do it again Go on do it againI once knew a woman who drove a convertible
metallic navy white leather interior gloss veneer
fabric reclining roof A thing of  vehicular beauty 
When she sold it she never wrote a poem
