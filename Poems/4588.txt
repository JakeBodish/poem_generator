the Blue Planet voiceover explains
orcas pushing a blue whale calf
under  Keet our son points
at the screen naming them all
one whale from the greek kētos
water-monster “The seas bathed
in calf’s blood ” More our son
asks More okean watches the red
beneath them spreading More ocean 
“Killer whales” the voice reminds
the blue calf’s heart bigger
than all three of ours its blood could fill
our son’s bathtub for weeks  The orcas
only eat the head let the rest sink
to the ocean floor but no the voice
points out how body born six thousand pounds
lands on the skeleton of a full grown blue
“Nothing gets wasted in the water ”Look our son staring Look
learning how the deep devours
blubber separates from bone
even bone won’t survive long
eaten by water worms and salt 
Spicy our son calls any intense
flavor tears in his mouth but no
not over this the calf’s
blood or its bones the orcas
swimming through reddened salt
but over desire he wants
what he cannot have
or doesn’t want what he is
given a calf’s heart
in the teeth of a hungrier mammal
because what else is worth
that much salt
