Ooze oud  Ease hearts whose eyes sink low 
Be hourglass in the pillaged O  
Be wells none see  Unstoppered tears
O oud we gather in your bowl 
O ladle of ores scoop ink here
now seeping from the foreigner
be sighs O oud and cloven aches
in the dark of millions of ears 
Be gift for famished wails and wakes
to lacks and flares and tented stakes
the lonely outer sounds of sleeves
eating wind and drowning faces 
The oud’s a lovely ark that leaks
with tales and bromides we can’t keep
and miles of ghosts before their sleep 
And miles of ghosts beneath our sleep
