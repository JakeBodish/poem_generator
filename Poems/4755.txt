
I find it in a field of feathers pink-cresteda knuckle of bone picked clean by the winda pale mohawk mounted on stone I bend down  Zeroed out of its head are two sockets two airy planetsfull with sun and taking asylum in onea millipede is coiled a slick black hypnotist Polished it spirals in on itselflike one of Saint Hilda’s fossil snakeswe studied in the school chapel’s stained glass  As if the eye could dig itself into the earth then extend a curled feeler out like a fern I turn the skull round in my palm like a pebble it will not settle  Otherwise all is still the grasses claw in the world does not tilt Even the blue stand of scrub grows overit has nothing on its mind  But the skull will outlast the summer a thought cut shortand I will pass it every day as I walkand stop just here where the air hones its teethon bone where the mind remembers itselfonly as a shell and I will mourn what was once a world one eye rolled to the daylight moon the other pressed down into the earth
