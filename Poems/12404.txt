
Nights by the light of whatever would burn
tallow tinder and the silken rope
of wick that burns slow slow
we wove the baskets from the long gold strands
of wheat that were another silk worm soul
spun the one yellow seed in the dark soil the other 
The fields lay fallow swollen with frost
expectant winter  Mud clung to the edges
of our gowns we had hung back like shadows
on the walls of trees and watched  In the little circles
that our tapers threw murdered men rose red
in their clanging armor muttered
words that bled through the bars
of iron masks the lord
who sold us to the glory fields lied
