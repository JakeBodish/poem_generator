
Cookies for sale
And cake One dime
Thats what it says
on my cardboard sign 
I pile cookies on a plate 
I eat just one
and then I wait       
I taste the cake
one tiny slice
I squeeze the lemons
and stir the ice
I count and stack
the paper cups       
fresh lemonade
is coming up
I count the bruises
on my knee      
wont somebody buy somethingplease
