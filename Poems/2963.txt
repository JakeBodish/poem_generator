
Thats why were here said Julio Lugo
to the Globe  Sox fans booed
poor Lugo booed his at-bat after
he dropped the ball in the pivotal fifth That ball I got to it I just couldnt come up with it 
Lugo wants you to know
he is fast a slower player
wouldnt even get close
enough to get booed  Lugo
wants you to know hes only
human Were human beings Thats why were here  If notI would have wings Id be beside God right now Id be an angel But Im not an angel Im a human being that lives right here 
Next day all
is forgiven  Lugos home run Lugos
sweet comment to the press 
I wanted to make a poster like the ones that sayIts my birthday or First Time at Fenway or pathetic ESPN 
Posterboard permanent marker to say Lugo me too Im a human being that lives right here decided
its too esoteric too ephemeral a reference but its true
Oh Lugo Julio Lugo Im here with you
