
Given over to love
she un-balls the socks
 
lets fall debris of days
leaf litter sand grain
 
slub of some sticky substance
picks it all for the sake
 
of the stainless tub
of the gleaming new front loader 
 
Given over to love long ago when her own
exasperated moan bounced off
 
the quaint speckled enamel
of the top loader
 
vowing shed do this always and well 
She fell in love then she fell in line 
 
in a march of millions you pair them
two by two you marry the socks
