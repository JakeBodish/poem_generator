
The Linguisticator meets you at Carrefour Un vrai galant he buys you rouge à lèvres 
Teaches socially accepted forms of extrication 
If someone gropes you say Arrête tes bêtises 
If someone wonders why your hair is mussed say C’est le mistral 
If someone asks you to admire their ugly baby say Je me sauve  and leave 
The Linguisticator is a veritable language experience 
You programmed him in Oregon but he caught a virus 
Now his Frenchness is cent fois off the spectrum 
Sings Aznavour as you tour the centre historique and Piaf on the tramPadam Padam when it clangs 
The Linguisticator can stop a tram with one raised eyebrow
one soi-disant eyebrow  A fatalist he has abandoned caution
with certain potent liquors of the region  Ask him if he’s OK  he’ll sayLe silence éternel de ces vastes espaces m’effraie 
Ask him what irony means he saysTout pour le mieux dans ce meilleur des mondes possibles 
But if his ennui peaks he suspends all conversation 
Broods for hours muttering Putainje suis rien qu’un two-bit trompe l’œil 
Malaise on a loop  It never fades
