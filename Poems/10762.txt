
You thought you saw me
But you didnt 
I wear black turtlenecks 
Black panties 
Live in a tall cave
You dont know where my cave is 
But I come out 
Every day
To buy mustard  relish
See what 
A man 
Walking away from me 
No good 
Smash him
With a loud smash
Smash his metal table and cards 
Good
Down in my cave 
Put on my Seahawk gear
Watch Parade of Homes 
Watch Ron Popeil put chicken  fishes
 burgers  pork  macaroni in the same
box  Hey I can sell that
box At school 
Where I smash the gym teacher in his head
I dont wear my uniform 
I dont clean my locker 
I dont share my lunch with the athletes 
My lunch mustard 
Straight from the packet 
No one sits next to me 
Keep working my skills 
Keep circling the word blood
in Macbeth 
Good 
It takes days 
It takes days
