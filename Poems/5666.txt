
You wanted to be a butcherbut they made you be a lawyer You brought home presentswhen it was nobody’s birthday Smashed platters of meatshe cut against the grain Were a kind
 of portable shrine     I was supposed to cultivate a field of  bliss then return to my ordinary mind  You burned the filesand moved the office Made your children feara different school Liked your butter hardand your candy frozen Were a kind
of diamond drill drilling a hole right through my skull     quality sleep late November  What did it mean “field of bliss”   A sky alive “with your greatest mentor”   I wore your shoes big as boats
flopped through the house    while you made garlic eggs with garlic salt what  “represents the living teaching”    Sausages on toasted rye with a pickle and a smother of cheese and frosting
right out of  the can without the cake    You ruled
with a knife in one hand and a fork in the other you raged at my stony mother while I banged   from my high chair waving the bloodied bone   of something slaughtered   I was a butcher’s daughter  So all hail to me    Os Gurges Vortex Mouth I gap my craw and the bakeries of the cities fall I   stomp the docks   spew out a bullet stream of oyster shells I’ll  drain the seas   the silos on every farm the rice  from the paddy fields the fruit from all the orchard trees and then I’ll  eat the trees     I’ll eat with money and I’ll eat with my teeth until the rocks   and the mountains curl and my blood sings     I’m such a good girl   to eat the world
