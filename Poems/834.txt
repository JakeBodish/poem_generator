
Out of every hundred people
those who always know better
fifty-two 
Unsure of every step
almost all the rest 
Ready to help
if it doesnt take long
forty-nine 
Always good
because they cannot be otherwise
four well maybe five 
Able to admire without envy
eighteen 
Led to error
by youth which passes
sixty plus or minus 
Those not to be messed with
forty and four 
Living in constant fear
of someone or something
seventy-seven 
Capable of happiness
twenty-some-odd at most 
Harmless alone
turning savage in crowds
more than half for sure 
Cruel
when forced by circumstances
its better not to know
not even approximately 
Wise in hindsight
not many more
than wise in foresight 
Getting nothing out of life except things
thirty
though I would like to be wrong 
Doubled over in pain
and without a flashlight in the dark
eighty-three sooner or later 
Those who are just
quite a few at thirty-five 
But if it takes effort to understand
three 
Worthy of empathy
ninety-nine 
Mortal
one hundred out of one hundred 
a figure that has never varied yet
