Weep with me all you that read
     This little storyAnd know for whom a tear you shed
     Deaths self is sorry Twas a child that so did thrive
     In grace and featureAs heaven and nature seemd to strive
     Which ownd the creature Years he numberd scarce thirteen
     When fates turnd cruelYet three filld zodiacs had he been
     The stages jewelAnd did act what now we moan
     Old men so dulyAs sooth the Parcæ thought him one
     He playd so truly So by error to his fate
     They all consentedBut viewing him since alas too late
     They have repentedAnd have sought to give new birth
     In baths to steep himBut being so much too good for earth
     Heaven vows to keep him
