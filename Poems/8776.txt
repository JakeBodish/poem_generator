
You jerk you didnt call me up
I havent seen you in so long
You probably have a fucking tan
 besides that instead of making love tonight
Youre drinking your parents to the airport
Im through with you bourgeois boys
All you ever do is go back to ancestral comforts
Only money can get even Catullus was rich but
Nowadays you guys settle for a couch
By a soporific color cable t v  set
Instead of any arc of love no wonder
The G I  Joe team blows it every other time
Wake up Its the middle of the night
You can either make love or die at the hands of the Cobra Commander

To make love turn to page 121 
To die turn to page 172
