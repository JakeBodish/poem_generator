worth denied She gives in large recruits of needful pride For as in bodies thus in souls we find What wants in blood and spirits swelld with wind Pride where wit fails steps in to our defence And fills up all the mighty void of sense If once right reason drives that cloud away Truth breaks upon us with resistless day Trust not yourself but your defects to know Make use of evry friend and evry foe         A little learning is a dangrous thing Drink deep or taste not the Pierian spring There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain And drinking largely sobers us again  Fird at first sight with what the Muse imparts In fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts While from the bounded level of our mind Short views we take nor see the lengths behind But more advancd behold with strange surprise New distant scenes of endless science rise So pleasd at first the towring Alps we try Mount oer the vales and seem to tread the sky Th eternal snows appear already past And the first clouds and mountains seem the last But those attaind we tremble to survey The growing labours of the lengthend way Th increasing prospect tires our wandring eyes Hills peep oer hills and Alps on Alps arise        A perfect judge will read each work of wit With the same spirit that its author writ Survey the whole nor seek slight faults to find Where nature moves and rapture warms the mind Nor lose for that malignant dull delight The genrous pleasure to be charmd with wit  But in such lays as neither ebb nor flow Correctly cold and regularly low That shunning faults one quiet tenour keep We cannot blame indeed but we may sleep  In wit as nature what affects our hearts Is not th exactness of peculiar parts Tis not a lip or eye we beauty call But the joint force and full result of all  Thus when we view some well-proportiond dome The worlds just wonder and evn thine O Rome No single parts unequally surprise All comes united to th admiring eyes No monstrous height or breadth or length appear The whole at once is bold and regular         Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see Thinks what neer was nor is nor eer shall be  In evry work regard the writers end Since none can compass more than they intend And if the means be just the conduct true Applause in spite of trivial faults is due  As men of breeding sometimes men of wit T avoid great errors must the less commit Neglect the rules each verbal critic lays For not to know such trifles is a praise  Most critics fond of some subservient art Still make the whole depend upon a part They talk of principles but notions prize And all to one lovd folly sacrifice         Once on a time La Manchas knight they say A certain bard encountring on the way Discoursd in terms as just with looks as sage As eer could Dennis of the Grecian stage Concluding all were desprate sots and fools Who durst depart from Aristotles rules  Our author happy in a judge so nice Producd his play and beggd the knights advice Made him observe the subject and the plot The manners passions unities what not All which exact to rule were brought about Were but a combat in the lists left out  What leave the combat out exclaims the knight Yes or we must renounce the Stagirite  Not so by Heavn he answers in a rage Knights squires and steeds must enter on the stage  So vast a throng the stage can neer contain  Then build a new or act it in a plain         Thus critics of less judgment than caprice Curious not knowing not exact but nice Form short ideas and offend in arts As most in manners by a love to parts         Some to conceit alone their taste confine And glittring thoughts struck out at evry line Pleasd with a work where nothings just or fit One glaring chaos and wild heap of wit  Poets like painters thus unskilld to trace The naked nature and the living grace With gold and jewels cover evry part And hide with ornaments their want of art  True wit is nature to advantage dressd What oft was thought but neer so well expressd Something whose truth convincd at sight we find That gives us back the image of our mind  As shades more sweetly recommend the light So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit  For works may have more wit than does em good As bodies perish through excess of blood         Others for language all their care express And value books as women men for dress Their praise is still the style is excellent The sense they humbly take upon content  Words are like leaves and where they most abound Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found  False eloquence like the prismatic glass Its gaudy colours spreads on evry place The face of Nature we no more survey All glares alike without distinction gay But true expression like th unchanging sun Clears and improves whateer it shines upon It gilds all objects but it alters none  Expression is the dress of thought and still Appears more decent as more suitable A vile conceit in pompous words expressd Is like a clown in regal purple dressd For diffrent styles with diffrent subjects sort As several garbs with country town and court  Some by old words to fame have made pretence Ancients in phrase mere moderns in their sense Such labourd nothings in so strange a style Amaze th unlearnd and make the learned smile  Unlucky as Fungoso in the play These sparks with awkward vanity display What the fine gentleman wore yesterday And but so mimic ancient wits at best As apes our grandsires in their doublets dressd  In words as fashions the same rule will hold Alike fantastic if too new or old Be not the first by whom the new are tried Not yet the last to lay the old aside         But most by numbers judge a poets song And smooth or rough with them is right or wrong In the bright Muse though thousand charms conspire Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear Not mend their minds as some to church repair Not for the doctrine but the music there  These equal syllables alone require Tho oft the ear the open vowels tire While expletives their feeble aid do join And ten low words oft creep in one dull line While they ring round the same unvaried chimes With sure returns of still expected rhymes  Whereer you find the cooling western breeze In the next line it whispers through the trees If crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep The readers threatend not in vain with sleep  Then at the last and only couplet fraught With some unmeaning thing they call a thought A needless Alexandrine ends the song That like a wounded snake drags its slow length along  Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes and know Whats roundly smooth or languishingly slow And praise the easy vigour of a line Where Denhams strength and Wallers sweetness join  True ease in writing comes from art not chance As those move easiest who have learnd to dance  Tis not enough no harshness gives offence The sound must seem an echo to the sense  Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows But when loud surges lash the sounding shore The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar  When Ajax strives some rocks vast weight to throw The line too labours and the words move slow Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain Flies oer th unbending corn and skims along the main  Hear how Timotheus varied lays surprise And bid alternate passions fall and rise While at each change the son of Libyan Jove Now burns with glory and then melts with love Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow Now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found And the worlds victor stood subdud by sound The powr of music all our hearts allow And what Timotheus was is Dryden now         Avoid extremes and shun the fault of such Who still are pleasd too little or too much  At evry trifle scorn to take offence That always shows great pride or little sense Those heads as stomachs are not sure the best Which nauseate all and nothing can digest  Yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move For fools admire but men of sense approve As things seem large which we through mists descry Dulness is ever apt to magnify         Some foreign writers some our own despise The ancients only or the moderns prize  Thus wit like faith by each man is applied To one small sect and all are damnd beside  Meanly they seek the blessing to confine And force that sun but on a part to shine Which not alone the southern wit sublimes But ripens spirits in cold northern climes Which from the first has shone on ages past Enlights the present and shall warm the last Though each may feel increases and decays And see now clearer and now darker days  Regard not then if wit be old or new But blame the false and value still the true  Some neer advance a judgment of their own But catch the spreading notion of the town They reason and conclude by precedent And own stale nonsense which they neer invent  Some judge of authors names not works and then Nor praise nor blame the writings but the men  Of all this servile herd the worst is he That in proud dulness joins with quality A constant critic at the great mans board To fetch and carry nonsense for my Lord  What woeful stuff this madrigal would be In some starvd hackney sonneteer or me But let a Lord once own the happy lines How the wit brightens how the style refines Before his sacred name flies every fault And each exalted stanza teems with thought        The vulgar thus through imitation err As oft the learnd by being singular So much they scorn the crowd that if the throng By chance go right they purposely go wrong So Schismatics the plain believers quit And are but damnd for having too much wit         Some praise at morning what they blame at night But always think the last opinion right  A Muse by these is like a mistress usd This hour shes idolizd the next abusd While their weak heads like towns unfortified Twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side  Ask them the cause theyre wiser still they say And still tomorrows wiser than today  We think our fathers fools so wise we grow Our wiser sons no doubt will think us so  Once school divines this zealous isle oerspread Who knew most Sentences was deepest read Faith Gospel all seemd made to be disputed And none had sense enough to be confuted Scotists and Thomists now in peace remain Amidst their kindred cobwebs in Duck Lane  If Faith itself has different dresses worn What wonder modes in wit should take their turn Oft leaving what is natural and fit The current folly proves the ready wit And authors think their reputation safe Which lives as long as fools are pleased to laugh         Some valuing those of their own side or mind Still make themselves the measure of mankind Fondly we think we honour merit then When we but praise ourselves in other men  Parties in wit attend on those of state And public faction doubles private hate  Pride Malice Folly against Dryden rose In various shapes of Parsons Critics Beaus But sense survivd when merry jests were past For rising merit will buoy up at last  Might he return and bless once more our eyes New Blackmores and new Milbourns must arise Nay should great Homer lift his awful head Zoilus again would start up from the dead  Envy will merit as its shade pursue But like a shadow proves the substance true For envied wit like Sol eclipsd makes known Th opposing bodys grossness not its own  When first that sun too powerful beams displays It draws up vapours which obscure its rays But evn those clouds at last adorn its way Reflect new glories and augment the day         Be thou the first true merit to befriend His praise is lost who stays till all commend  Short is the date alas of modern rhymes And tis but just to let em live betimes  No longer now that golden age appears When patriarch wits survivd a thousand years Now length of Fame our second life is lost And bare threescore is all evn that can boast Our sons their fathers failing language see And such as Chaucer is shall Dryden be  So when the faithful pencil has designd Some bright idea of the masters mind Where a new world leaps out at his command And ready Nature waits upon his hand When the ripe colours soften and unite And sweetly melt into just shade and light When mellowing years their full perfection give And each bold figure just begins to live The treacherous colours the fair art betray And all the bright creation fades away        Unhappy wit like most mistaken things Atones not for that envy which it brings  In youth alone its empty praise we boast But soon the short-livd vanity is lost Like some fair flowr the early spring supplies That gaily blooms but evn in blooming dies  What is this wit which must our cares employ The owners wife that other men enjoy Then most our trouble still when most admird And still the more we give the more requird Whose fame with pains we guard but lose with ease Sure some to vex but never all to please Tis what the vicious fear the virtuous shun By fools tis hated and by knaves undone        If wit so much from ignrance undergo Ah let not learning too commence its foe Of old those met rewards who could excel And such were praisd who but endeavourd well Though triumphs were to genrals only due Crowns were reservd to grace the soldiers too  Now they who reach Parnassus lofty crown Employ their pains to spurn some others down        And while self-love each jealous writer rules Contending wits become the sport of fools But still the worst with most regret commend For each ill author is as bad a friend  To what base ends and by what abject ways Are mortals urgd through sacred lust of praise Ah neer so dire a thirst of glory boast Nor in the critic let the man be lost Good nature and good sense must ever join To err is human to forgive divine         But if in noble minds some dregs remain Not yet purgd off of spleen and sour disdain Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes Nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times  No pardon vile obscenity should find Though wit and art conspire to move your mind But dulness with obscenity must prove As shameful sure as impotence in love  In the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease Sprung the rank weed and thrivd with large increase When love was all an easy monarchs care Seldom at council never in a war Jilts ruled the state and statesmen farces writ Nay wits had pensions and young Lords had wit The fair sat panting at a courtiers play And not a mask went unimprovd away The modest fan was lifted up no more And virgins smild at what they blushd before  The following licence of a foreign reign Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain Then unbelieving priests reformd the nation And taught more pleasant methods of salvation Where Heavns free subjects might their rights dispute Lest God himself should seem too absolute Pulpits their sacred satire learned to spare And Vice admired to find a flattrer there Encouragd thus wits Titans bravd the skies And the press groand with licencd blasphemies  These monsters critics with your darts engage Here point your thunder and exhaust your rage Yet shun their fault who scandalously nice Will needs mistake an author into vice All seems infected that th infected spy As all looks yellow to the jaundicd eye
