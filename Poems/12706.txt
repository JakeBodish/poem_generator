
By a dismal cypress lyingDamon cried all pale and dyingKind is death that ends my painBut cruel she I lovd in vain The mossy fountainsMurmur my troubleAnd hollow mountainsMy groans redoubleEvry nymph mourns meThus while I languishShe only scorns meWho causd my anguish No love returning me but all hope denyingBy a dismal cypress lyingLike a swan so sung he dyingKind is death that ends my painBut cruel she I lovd in vain
