Now the storm begins to lowerHaste the loom of Hell prepare Iron-sleet of arrowy showerHurtles in the darkend air Glittring lances are the loomWhere the dusky warp we strainWeaving many a soldiers doomOrkneys woe and Randvers bane See the grisly texture growTis of human entrails madeAnd the weights that play belowEach a gasping warriors head Shafts for shuttles dipt in goreShoot the trembling cords along Sword that once a monarch boreKeep the tissue close and strong Mista black terrific maidSangrida and Hilda seeJoin the wayward work to aidTis the woof of victory Ere the ruddy sun be setPikes must shiver javelins singBlade with clattring buckler meetHauberk crash and helmet ring Weave the crimson web of warLet us go and let us flyWhere our friends the conflict shareWhere they triumph where they die As the paths of fate we treadWading thro th ensanguind fieldGondula and Geira spreadOer the youthful king your shield We the reins to slaughter giveOurs to kill and ours to spareSpite of danger he shall live Weave the crimson web of war They whom once the desert-beachPent within its bleak domainSoon their ample sway shall stretchOer the plenty of the plain Low the dauntless earl is laidGord with many a gaping woundFate demands a nobler headSoon a king shall bite the ground Long his loss shall Erin weepNeer again his likeness seeLong her strains in sorrow steepStrains of immortality Horror covers all the heathClouds of carnage blot the sun Sisters weave the web of deathSisters cease the work is done Hail the task and hail the handsSongs of joy and triumph singJoy to the victorious bandsTriumph to the younger king Mortal thou that hearst the taleLearn the tenor of our song Scotland thro each winding vale
 Far and wide the notes prolong Sisters hence with spurs of speedEach her thundring falchion wieldEach bestride her sable steed Hurry hurry to the field
