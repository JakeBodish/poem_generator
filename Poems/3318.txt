1  Santa Fe
The walls are old he says 
I turn in the plaza and nod to Weldon Kees
his face as dark as the cool shadows
that surround us walls keeping him
safe honoring his silence though
he comes to me to be led away 
The mountains out there are not old
he claims and slips his hands into his coat 
We cross the street each Indian blanket
on the ground holding jewelry I would love
to touch but Kees and the Navajo man
selling his crafts are whispering to the ground 
Kees surprises me by entering the Museum of Arts 
I follow him the stone floor ringing with
our footsteps empty arches blending above 
Kees stops and turns to me 
One can see only so much he says 
He leads me to the twisted dwarf
the tangles form of faith and death
arrows bristling from its muscled body
a sacrifice of the ugly encased in glass
Kees staring at the sculpture as if
he knows why we really cant see it 
He points to the deepest arrow
and places a hand on my shoulder 
When you believe this you are home
he tells me and walks out 
2  Albuquerque
The Sangre de Cristo mountains are old
and he is driving my car to the highest ridge
the valley below avoiding the bright moon
the same white light in the bay Kees wanted
to touch before he left 
Mist and clouds are a lie he claims 
Look down there  Men are running away 
He drives slowly to the top and we get out
the autumn sun burning terraces into scrub
cedars and piñon pines he wrote about
when he crossed here long ago
standing on the edge of the cliff
as if this is the only way for him to go 
Look past what you want to see
he sighs as the wind takes his slick hair
and makes him into someone
I have seen before the streets of
Albuquerque down there as dusty
as his closed eyes 
We stand on the edge and I wait
at this elevation with Kees who wrote
that the towns we will not visit are
places where home truly lies 
I must go he decides 
Where to I ask 
Anyplace you havent seen he says
and walks down the mountain 
3  Tyuonyi
Kees and I are happy when the sun
splits the tree for a moment because
yesterday controlled this mountain dawn
burning mud deeper into the adobe 
Cottonwoods catch fire here give
the people time to hide inside turtle shells
though they come out to watch us 
I stop as the drawings come to life
under the arches symbols familiar
to those who sleep by crossing
the street each night 
As I stare I realize a man who
diappears wants to understand
and not hide yet the designs
tempt me to walk in the wrong
direction and leave him behind 
To go farther up would mean
a canyon where I have been 
A dirt street inside another path
tiny houses falling back
letting me pass beyond their
locked doors as if the smoking
windows know where I must go 
When I enter the placita the old
woman is not there because this
is about bringing Kees back 
The dirt street opens to the last
scorched tree breaking out of walls
to shade what cant be blessed its
branches confusing until their cracks
enter the ground in search of peace 
4  Santa Maria
Water disappears to settle as clear glass
that contains memories of thirst
the ancient hole found in the ruins
Kees hand keeping the others from skimming
the surface of the still water reaching
to be alone under the mountain wall
though eyes that watch have seen this before
men entering and never coming out 
One hand keeps the other from touching the surface 
Pulling back allows the echo of falling rocks
the deep swimmer breaking through walls
to emerge on the other side of the well
where the first figures to emerge in centuries are
sitting and rubbing sand over their wet shivering bodies 
5  Fort Selden
Kees is getting tired in the desert heat
and sits on a historic slab of western settlement
this old fort a museum where thirsty men
come to drink from the bitter well 
Kees smokes too many cigarettes
and shakes his head at me
Look at the moth and the deep iris in your garden
because the equation I found in San Francisco
is an eclipse drawn on paper
by my trembling hands 
He pauses and takes a drag my head bathed
in sweat and confusion as he coughs this
It is too late because jazz has gone away 
I placed a stone deity of a bird next to an eggplant
on my desk its smooth purple skin as significant
as the gathering of birds in your head
their chirping coming from sorrow
even from the bay where I never told a lie
though the grand steps lead to the burned church
where the musicians used to trace my forehead 
I stare at him and he tosses smoke on the ground
because we are close to home 
6  El Paso
Kees waits at the bus station
in my hometown 
We cannot go farther because
the border here is out there and as violent
as the reasons he disappeared
in San Francisco a long time ago 
I want to tell him who I think he is
but I grew up here and must hide
how things have really been
drawing the light off the mountains
as if the doubters of history are simply
starving boys offering to shine Kees
shoes on the corner of Paisano Street 
My hometown has a bridge
but Kees wont go near it because
he says to cross it would be
to admit there is something wrong
on the other side of my familys house 
He can never cross because
we have found our way here
El Paso dreaming its population
of mute men must keep growing
because the border keeps taking
too many of them away 
Kees looks at the bus schedule
runs out of cigarettes
and everything is closed 
He nods at nothing and waits
on the bench with someone
he swears looks like me
