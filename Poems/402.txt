
Silence is the sound the knife makes
slitting the skin 
Can you identify my weakness
a pricking sensation
and numbness in one limb
Can you hold this tongue
Tell me what is the function
of meticulous courage 
You are the most yourself
when you are in the motion 
One can be quick and too quick 
I have a stomach too 
It gets hungry 
If I be of necessity
opportunity
if there be the slightest chance of success
why have a mind if
Does that scream in the night across the alley
beg an answer Are we crowning
into the sludge of an injury and its repair
An elephant is larger and stronger than a horse
but it is not preferred as a beast of burden 
Strength is a wee umbrella
in the storm 
This the friction sound heard
in inspiration expiration or both 
For convenience of description
blood is bright red and frothy 
Have you earned the privilege
of making mistakes
There really is no sex in science 
The nomenclature lifts
delicate subjects up from the plane
in which language places them 
Man has more strength
woman more endurance 
The hands and the instruments
are the chief sources of danger 
This fever 
There is no subject on which so much has been written
                                                                             and so little known
