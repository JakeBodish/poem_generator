
Five daughters in the slant light on the porch
are bickering  The eldest has come home
with new truths she can hardly wait to teach 
She lectures them the younger daughters search
the sky elbow each others ribs and groan 
Five daughters in the slant light on the porch
and blue-sprigged dresses like a stand of birch
saplings whose leaves are going yellow-brown
with new truths  They can hardly wait to teach
themselves to be called Maam to march
high-heeled across the hanging bridge to town 
Five daughters  In the slant light on the porch
Pomp lowers his paper for a while to watch
the beauties hes begotten with his Ann
these new truths they can hardly wait to teach 
The eldest sniffs A lady doesnt scratch 
The third snorts back Knock knock nobody home 
The fourth concedes Well maybe not in church       
Five daughters in the slant light on the porch
