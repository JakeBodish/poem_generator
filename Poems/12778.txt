
Four Seasons fill the measure of the year     There are four seasons in the mind of manHe has his lusty Spring when fancy clear     Takes in all beauty with an easy spanHe has his Summer when luxuriously     Springs honied cud of youthful thought he lovesTo ruminate and by such dreaming high     Is nearest unto heaven quiet covesHis soul has in its Autumn when his wings     He furleth close contented so to lookOn mists in idleness to let fair things     Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook He has his Winter too of pale misfeatureOr else he would forego his mortal nature
