
Imagine you wake up
with a second chance The blue jay
hawks his pretty wares
and the oak still stands spreading
glorious shade  If you dont look back
the future never happens 
How good to rise in sunlight
in the prodigal smell of biscuits -
eggs and sausage on the grill 
The whole sky is yours
to write on blown open
to a blank page  Come on
shake a leg Youll never know
whos down there frying those eggs
if you dont get up and see
