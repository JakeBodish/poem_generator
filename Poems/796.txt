
In the pink light
haloes of cloud form over the mountains
lightning two valleys away
then not an hour later
 
the explosion of thunder 
The roadrunners
pecking for breadcrumbs on the porch
have long since fled into the rabbitbrush
 
into the endless ocean of grass 
Driving in every direction
down licks of red road I have lost
myself in a militarized topography
 
everything named after army units
generals scouts miners…The Dragoon MountainsCochise Stronghold defunct
 Gleeson and Pearce
weird rusty ghost towns the only
non-derelict structure
for miles the local school
 
its polished windows and well-kept lawn
a source of great local pride 
No mountain monograms
for these desiccated whistle-stops
 
no giant Q or C or W in bright
white paint to mark
the townships still functional
sorta functional breathing no
 
carving for them
into the planets bark
and thus they are blesséd
to me like no other
 
every successful city
is a flimsy affair with civility
its eternalness like Paris or Rome
mere hypocrisy 
 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
BUY REAL ESTATE Hail follows rain 
Nearby the township of Sunsites
once billed as the safest
 
spot to survive
the inevitable nuclear winter
actually topped Soviet Russias
list of high-priority targets… Enter
 
the Orange Duck Candidate 
A haboob sweeps across
the Valley of the Senile 
In a week the mountains
 
have switched from brown
to purple to green 
The desert is human
endeavours most fitting graveyard
 
the slow bleaching
the gradual eroding into sand
the heat stifling sound as it leaps into the air 
IT CANT HAPPEN HERE  But it always does
