
Every day in summer Id cross the border
hed nod pick up the horseshoes
hand me one triple the size
of my palm and say You first  Wed play
away the afternoon  Few words
punctuated the clank of horseshoe
against stake until the fog rolled in
and Id retrace my steps home 
I was five or six he white haired
however old that meant 
One evening my father sat me down
spoke in the exaggerated tone
adults adapt for children asked
if I knew who he was 
Admiral Nimitz of course though
I knew nothing of his command
of the Pacific Fleet and was less impressed
than if hed landed a horseshoe 
He was a calm man a useful attribute
for sending young men to their deaths 
The only time I saw him upset
raccoons had invaded from their hideouts
in the hills attacked the goldfish in his pond
leaving muddy footprints as they escaped 
As far as I knew this was his only defeat
