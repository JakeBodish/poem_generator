
Lots of time lots of cars
Lots of money so much love
Very cold and very hot 
But now it’s freezing out
The director Lanzmann is giving us an interview
Without it must be said
Much passion 
This man was intimate with
Simone de Beauvoir
And worked alongside Sartre 
But that’s later  For now
Channel One
Is filming him en face
In the next room
And we can make out
A few scattered remarks 
His nine-hour film
About the Holocaust
Played in every
Country   
People nodded off
And in their dreams
They saw the horrors
And the voice of our famous guest
Faded in and faded out 
It fades in fades out
In the hall
The beautiful
Camilla comes and goes 
She perches on the sofa
Then she walks away 
The assistant to the cultural attaché
Of the French Embassy
Is also here  She’s the one
Who signed up me and Kolya
For this interview with Lanzmann 
She’s also beautiful and young 
A little older than us
But she looks younger 
Whereas me and Kolya
We don’t want to look younger 
One of us is thirty-three
The other’s thirty-four 
Not yet at the peak
Of our powers
We’re gathering force
And preparing to strike 
We’re like Lanzmann
Who at the age of eighteen
Joined the French
Communist Party 
He joined not because
He read Marx or Lenin
But because he was asked
By his friends
In the Resistance 
We are like Lanzmann
Who cried when he learned
Of the death of Stalin 
He cried not because
He loved Stalin
But because he was
Sentimental
He saw Soviet
Sailors
Lowering their flags to half-mast
And thought about how
The Soviet people
Had absorbed
During the war
The most terrible
And frightful blows 
We are like Lanzmann
Who in 1949
Made the acquaintance
Of Sartre and Simone
De Beauvoir 
He began to work with them
On the magazineLes Tempes modernes 
And today he is
That publication’s
Editor in chief 
We are like Lanzmann
Who in 1972
Made the filmIsrael Why
Which in the words
Of the online encyclopedia
“Did not shy away from
Difficult questions ”
We discussed all our questions
In advance of the interview 
Inside us it was as if
Some keys cold and hot
Were rattling  It’s nearly freezing out 
Meanwhile I was thinking about how
Kolya is a rude artist 
In the sense that
There are radical artists
Everywhere you look
But not so many
Genuinely rude artists 
The rudeness of an artist
I thought
Is an interesting quality 
But now Channel One is leaving
Kolya takes off his jacket with its skulls
And sets up our cameras 
“We are the representatives of the left” we say 
Lanzmann lowers his gaze wearily
Now they’re going to start in about Israel 
But Kolya having explained a bit
About his art collective
Asks Lanzmann instead
About monumental
Art
“Monumental
Art  What might it look like
Right now”
“How should I know”
Says Lanzmann 
“There could be no
Monumental
Art
Today 
The world is scattered  For
A monumental
Work you need
A unified sense
Of the world ”
“But you yourself
Filmed a monumental
Work  Surely you have
Some ideas on this score”
“I didn’t think about
That  I’m an artist
Understand I don’t
Think in such
Categories  What are you
Communists
Your task is
The Revolution 
Why are you asking
Me about
Monumental
Art”
We’re the ones asking the questions
We’re the ones asking the questions
We
           here
                       are the ones
                                                 asking the questions 
In the iron air
Of Moscow 
Edelman Markelov
Pechersky are with us 
Medvedev the Bear Jew and Jeff
“The Snowman” Monson   
That’s what they call us
Around town 
“In what capacity
Did you make that film   
As a Frenchman a Jew
An intellectual
Or as a member
Of the Resistance”
“I repeat
I wanted           ”
 
 • 
“Does the term
The ‘Holocaust Industry’
Mean anything to you”
“What’s that”
Asks Lanzmann 
I warned Kolya
That Lanzmann wouldn’t
Understand
Or would pretend
Not to understand
What that means 
“The Holocaust Industry
Usually means
The use of the memory
Of the destruction of the Jews
During World War II
To legitimate in part
The State of Israel ”
The translator starts
To worry 
She suspects us
Of anti-Semitism 
But we are like Lanzmann
Who came
                             to Moscow
To do this strange interview
Without revealing his secrets 
He won’t talk
He’s hard as a rock
This man whose youth
Is reflected
In our cocky
Faces 
Lanzmann himself has conducted
Many interviews
With Franz Suchomel
The SS Unterscharführer
With  Jan Karski
And others 
He knows very well
How to walk
His subjects
Into this or that
Confession
Or experience
All while leveraging
His moral authority 
And here gradually
In the words of this master
Of the interview
We begin to detect
The artistic position
Which we so oppose 
“I you know just
Slapped together this
Thing 
I was interested
In the human aspect 
As for ideas
And theories
That’s not my bag ”
 
• 
Of course many artists
Take this stand 
They don’t interest us at all 
But Lanzmann on the one hand
Enjoys this status
As an artist who works with
Emotions memories
His own and other people’s
Experiences that is more with
Emotions than with documents 
On the other hand he knew
Full well that his film
Would be received
As a political proclamation
That it would quickly occupy the heart
Of intellectual and socio-
Political debates 
To work on people’s feelings
As an artist while at the same time
Refusing to engage in rational
Explanations of the sort
Demanded of intellectuals   really
This is the same stuff as using the
“Incomprehensibility” of Hitler
Or the destruction of the Jews
As a form of political argument   
And this is the shameful
Hypocrisy of our friend Lanzmann 
How to save himself
From this disgrace
The old man Lanzmann
Does not know 
But we know and we’ll tell
You need to speak about Israel
You need to speak about Israel
In this is the key to immortality
This is the burning wound
And it is Lanzmann who understands this
He knows that politics is the wound
On the body of history 
An unnecessary unwanted wound
That will not heal 
To refuse to forget politics
To refuse to tear Israel
From one’s heart   
Because politics is
Always here
And Palestine is a bloody wound that says
Politics is
Always here 
You can’t hide from it
At the supermarket
You can’t run from it
With beautiful words 
And old man Lanzmann
Understands this
He knows that
Politics is the wound
On the body of history 
In its inability to process its own
Information
A rejection of politics
Leads to senility 
Only later would I find
This passage
In an interview Lanzmann gave
To Der SpiegelSpiegel You write
That the Israeli military doctor
Who gave you a check-up
Before you flew in a fighter plane
Said you could live
Until a hundred and twenty 
Are you worried about
Death right now
At your age
Lanzmann I have no age 
I constantly think
Of death including
My own 
At the same time
This remains totally
Unreal  As I said
Earlier only life
Has any meaning 
 
• 
“Does the term
The ‘Holocaust Industry’
Mean anything to you”
“I don’t want
To talk
About Israel 
I repeat
You are thinking
In abstract
Categories ”
“Yes but your film
Became the center
Of intellectual
Debate   
About the uniqueness
Of the Holocaust
About the supposed
Anti-Semitism
Of the Poles  Many
Thought that your movie
Made the Poles out
To be
Anti-Semites ”
“Israel exists
Under impossible
Pressure 
Its army must be judged
According to different measures 
The Israeli Merkava tank
Was created
In impossible conditions 
Israeli tank officers
Love their Merkavas
They are obliged
To have them always
At the ready 
And you instead of
Building up
Abstract
Theories
Should try harder
To create artistic works        
An artist has his own
Way of seeing ”
And so on 
The director is tired 
It’s time for a rest 
“Communists I know your path 
First revolution then firing squads ”
A warning from the attaché   
Our time
Is almost up 
This will be
Our last question
And our judgment of the gray
Old man
Will be simple 
He has just one moment left
To die young 
But what did the fog of those eyes
Communicate
Vague sentence fragments
A dry unpleasant refusal
 
• 
“Hang in there boys 
Be strong just one more time 
Communists never surrender ”
