
My heart is bleeding  It bleeds upward and fills
my mouth up with salt  It bleeds because of a city in ruins
the chair still warm from sisters body
because it will all be irreproducible  My heart
bleeds because of baby bear not finding mama bear and it bleeds
to the tips of my fingers like I painted my nails Crimson 
Sometimes my heart bleeds so much I am a raisin 
It bleeds until I am a quivering ragged clot bleeds at the ending
with the heroine and her sunken cancer eyes at the ending
with the plaintive flute over smoke-choked killing fields  Im bleeding
a river of blood right now and its wearing a culvert in me for the blood  My heart
rises up in me becomes the cork of me and I choke on it  I am bleeding
for you and for me and for the tiny babies and the IED-blown
leg  It bleeds because Im made that way all filled up with blood
my sloppy heart a sponge filled with blood to squeeze onto 
any circumstance  Because it is mine it will always bleed 
My heart bled today  It bled onto the streets
and the steps of city hall  It bled in the pizza parlor with the useless jukebox 
Ive got so much blood to give inside and outside of any milieu 
Even for a bad zoning decision Ill bleed so much youll be bleeding
all of us bleeding in and out like its breathing
or kissing and because it is righteous and terrible and red
