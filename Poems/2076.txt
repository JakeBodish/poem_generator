I see you look to buyin
Mister Johnson
That all you want is Fame
Mister Johnson
Now what you got to offer
Mister Johnson
Salvation is my name
With a rhythm on a riff
Thats practically God
Oh Lord Im a pure
Undivining rod
Im a flickerin candle
With the blackest light
Im the darkest angel
And I own the night
Mister Johnson
That instrument you got there
Mister Johnson
Its Lucifers guitar
Mister Johnson
Ill tune it for you baby
Mister Johnson
They wont know who you are
Im a cutthroat seller
The Magician of Deal
Who can stoke sweet fire
Thatll make you feel
Like a hothouse flower
On double defrost
Who wont give a nickel
For the petals it lost
Mister Johnson
You slink on back to livin
Mister Johnson
In devil-may-care control
Mister Johnson
Dont thank me for the favor
Mister Johnson
I thank you for your soul”
