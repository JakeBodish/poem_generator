
At first she thought the lump in the road
was clay thrown up by a trucker’s wheel 
Then Beatrice saw the mess of feathers
Six or seven geese stood in the right-of-way staring
at the blood their black heads rigid above white throats 
Unmoved by passing wind or familiar violence they fixed
their gaze on dead flesh and something more a bird on the wing 
It whirled in a thicket of fog that grew up from fields plowed
and turned to winter  It joined other spirits exhaled before dawn
creatures that once had crept or flapped or crawled over the land 
Beatrice had heard her mother tell of men who passed
as spirits  They hid in limestone caves by the river hooded
themselves inside the curved wall the glistening rock 
Then just at dark they appeared as if they had the power
to split the earth open to release them  White-robed faceless
horned heads they advanced with torches over the water
saying We are the ghosts of Shiloh and Bull Run fight
Neighbors who watched at the bridge knew each man by his voice
or limp or mended boots but said nothing allowed the marchers
to pass on  Then they ran their skinny hounds to hunt other
lives down ravines to save their skins another night from
the carrion beetles spotted with red darker than blood
who wait by the grave for the body’s return to the earth 
Some years the men killed scores treed them in the sweetgums 
Watched a man’s face flicker in the purple-black leaves 
Then they burned the tree 
Smoke from their fires
still lay over the land where Beatrice traveled 
Out of this cloud the dead of the field spoke to her
voices from the place where some voices never stopThey took my boy down by Sucarnochee Creek 
He said “Gentlemen what have I done”
They says “Never mind what you have done 
We just want your damned heart ” After they
killed him I built up a little fire and laid out
by him all night until the neighbors came
in the morning  I was standing there when
they killed him down by Sucarnochee Creek
