
For Ben’s project he must research five facts
about his African-American hero and write them
on poster board  He chooses Harriet Tubman
whose five facts are Her father’s name was Ben Her mother’s name was Old Rit  She was bornin 1820 and died in 1913  She was born in Marylandand died in New York  Ben asks for advice
about his fifth fact and I suggest She led more than300 people to freedom  Ben sighs the way he does
now and says Everyone knows that Mom 
 
So I try to remember the book we read yesterday
search for the perfect fact the one that will match
his four facts and satisfy his almost-seven mind Remember I ask she was a spy for the North during the Civil War It’s a hit He writes itHarriet Tubman was a spy for the north during the civil war  It was a war between the northwhich is where the slaves were trying to getand the south which is where they were Before the war Abraham Lincoln signed a formthat said All the slaves everywhere are freewhich is one of the reasons they were fighting 
 
On summer mornings Lincoln rode his horse
to work down the Seventh Street Turnpike
close to my new home  Down Georgia Avenue
past The Hunger Stopper and Pay Day 2 Go and liquor
stores and liquor stores  Past Cluck-U-Chicken
and Fish in the ‘Hood and Top Twins Faze II
Authentic African Cuisine and the newish Metro station
and all those possibilities gleaming in developers’ eyes 
 
There goes Lincoln’s horse down Georgia Avenue
from the Soldier’s Home to the White House –
much cooler up here in the country in the neighborhood
at the hospital  And there’s Walt Whitman the sworn poet
of every dauntless rebel the world over hanging around
his street corner every morning to bow to the president
at Thomas Circle by the homeless guys  It’s 100 years now
since any president summered at the Soldier’s Home 
But I was born only 50 years after Harriet Tubman died
all the centuries we drag into the next century and the next 
 
Writing here in my new neighborhood the city old
and new around me I see Harriet Tubman
and Lincoln and Uncle Walt and the true stories
and sometimes our own despair like Washington’s
summer malaria her 40 war hospitals Whitman moving
from bed to bed stroking the hair of so many dying boys 
 
North up Georgia Avenue in our own soldiers’ home –
Walter Reed – the boys and now girls too
mourn the ghosts of their own legs and arms
and our capacity for love  Where is their
sworn poet Harriet Tubman born
so close  All these heroes under our feet
