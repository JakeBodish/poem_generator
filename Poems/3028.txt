Did I say I was a creature
of habit
 
I meant the opposite 
 
I meant behavior
is a pile of clothes
 
I might or might not wear 
 
Before all the sowing and reaping
could go on for centuries
 
before the calendar
I must have been convinced
 
that my movements
were both mandated
 
and blessed

Ive never been an old woman
knitting by a fire
 
but Ive played one
in images
 
where it meant being foolish
or wise a mistress
 
of distractions
indirection 
 
To rock while entwining
is lifes work
 
but I am reckless
restless
