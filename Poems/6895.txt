
At sunset from the top of the stair watching
the castle mallets wrenched from their socket
fell from ambush into flame flew into hiding
above the stoneware a latch like muscle hid
the green he stood waist high under the rapt
ceiling and hanged the sparrow where the kitchen
had been a mirror of eggs served in a tumbler he
saw the ring when a lancet pierced and threw it 
In a basket and lowered it where sails enter
the harbor over a parchment like dominoes
the petrel-like eyelash 
To the sun and its rites were pulled the dried
banners they flew past the ruins the tower
and window where ivory guided the mist on his back
he rubbed his eyes and counted them kneeling
wrinkled as grass A ghost in their nostrils put a heel at their
forehead they saw only the moon as it
fasted
