
He can say it was a paintingHe can say we were the paintingOr that the painting wasn’t paintingAnd that we only happen to ourselvesWe can say we kept things runningby distracting ourselves from the hideous truth of  how things runThat we were brokenThat we lingered near a broken factoryThat we had brokenWe can say that the disappointment of slicing into a leek and not finding the requisite layersbut a thick white inedible core is not the disappointment of approaching a sleeping animal only to learn that it is deadbut it does nudge one slightly further into despair We said despair We meant the strings of impossible instruments that they made in the factoryThat we had seenThat were brokenThat there were different paintingsThat could be played as songsWe had seen other thingsThat we had seenThat had come unstrungand blown between adjacent bridgeswhose river had presented us a cityThat was brokenThat we had beenThat we were brokenThat was our cityThis was our citythat was a song replaying itself in the dark
