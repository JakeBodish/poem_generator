
Oh that those lips had language Life has passdWith me but roughly since I heard thee last Those lips are thine thy own sweet smiles I seeThe same that oft in childhood solaced meVoice only fails else how distinct they sayGrieve not my child chase all thy fears awayThe meek intelligence of those dear eyesBlest be the art that can immortalizeThe art that baffles times tyrannic claimTo quench it here shines on me still the same 
    Faithful remembrancer of one so dearOh welcome guest though unexpected hereWho biddst me honour with an artless songAffectionate a mother lost so longI will obey not willingly aloneBut gladly as the precept were her ownAnd while that face renews my filial griefFancy shall weave a charm for my relief Shall steep me in Elysian reverieA momentary dream that thou art she 
    My mother when I learnd that thou wast deadSay wast thou conscious of the tears I shedHoverd thy spirit oer thy sorrowing sonWretch even then lifes journey just begunPerhaps thou gavst me though unseen a kissPerhaps a tear if souls can weep in bliss Ah that maternal smile it answers Yes I heard the bell tolld on thy burial dayI saw the hearse that bore thee slow awayAnd turning from my nursry window drewA long long sigh and wept a last adieuBut was it such It was  Where thou art goneAdieus and farewells are a sound unknown May I but meet thee on that peaceful shoreThe parting sound shall pass my lips no moreThy maidens grievd themselves at my concernOft gave me promise of a quick return What ardently I wishd I long believdAnd disappointed still was still deceivdBy disappointment every day beguildDupe of to-morrow even from a child Thus many a sad to-morrow came and wentTill all my stock of infant sorrow spentI learnd at last submission to my lotBut though I less deplord thee neer forgot 
    Where once we dwelt our name is heard no moreChildren not thine have trod my nursry floorAnd where the gardner Robin day by dayDrew me to school along the public wayDelighted with my bauble coach and wraptIn scarlet mantle warm and velvet captTis now become a history little knownThat once we calld the pastral house our own Short-livd possession but the record fairThat memry keeps of all thy kindness thereStill outlives many a storm that has effacdA thousand other themes less deeply tracd Thy nightly visits to my chamber madeThat thou mightst know me safe and warmly laidThy morning bounties ere I left my homeThe biscuit or confectionary plumThe fragrant waters on my cheeks bestowdBy thy own hand till fresh they shone and glowdAll this and more endearing still than allThy constant flow of love that knew no fallNeer roughend by those cataracts and brakesThat humour interposd too often makesAll this still legible in memrys pageAnd still to be so to my latest ageAdds joy to duty makes me glad to paySuch honours to thee as my numbers mayPerhaps a frail memorial but sincereNot scornd in heavn though little noticd here 
    Could time his flight reversd restore the hoursWhen playing with thy vestures tissued flowrsThe violet the pink and jessamineI prickd them into paper with a pinAnd thou wast happier than myself the whileWouldst softly speak and stroke my head and smileCould those few pleasant hours again appearMight one wish bring them would I wish them hereI would not trust my heart the dear delightSeems so to be desird perhaps I might  But no what here we call our life is suchSo little to be lovd and thou so muchThat I should ill requite thee to constrainThy unbound spirit into bonds again 
    Thou as a gallant bark from Albions coastThe storms all weatherd and the ocean crossdShoots into port at some well-havend isleWhere spices breathe and brighter seasons smileThere sits quiescent on the floods that showHer beauteous form reflected clear belowWhile airs impregnated with incense playAround her fanning light her streamers gaySo thou with sails how swift hast reachd the shoreWhere tempests never beat nor billows roarAnd thy lovd consort on the dangrous tideOf life long since has anchord at thy side But me scarce hoping to attain that restAlways from port withheld always distressd Me howling winds drive devious tempest tossdSails ript seams opning wide and compass lostAnd day by day some currents thwarting forceSets me more distant from a prosprous course But oh the thought that thou art safe and heThat thought is joy arrive what may to me My boast is not that I deduce my birthFrom loins enthrond and rulers of the earthBut higher far my proud pretensions rise The son of parents passd into the skies And now farewell time unrevokd has runHis wonted course yet what I wishd is done By contemplations help not sought in vainI seem t have livd my childhood oer againTo have renewd the joys that once were mineWithout the sin of violating thineAnd while the wings of fancy still are freeAnd I can view this mimic shew of theeTime has but half succeeded in his theft Thyself removd thy power to sooth me left
