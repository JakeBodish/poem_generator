
Muscular as a stallion in fact   
but I have no horse in this race of people against people 
It was made certain I wouldn’t that I’d inherit nothing
except a whipping of my hindquarters as a form of correction
in the cadence of I love you tar baby I love you 
This is not unlike how my parents were raised to comply
and their parents before them and theirs before them and so forth
as far back as anyone cared to speak of what they lived
through the preposterous preposition of it all 
Therefore and thereafter whenever I hear the word pedigree
I think of the blank check I don’t have behind my name
and then I think of saddles and stirrups and then
the soreness of my lower back and then the source of that 
How a boss can ride you of this I am personally familiar
plus know by blood drawn from two lines of family men
forced to cut out their own tongues to keep food on the table
they could no longer taste or even stand to 
Their tongues grew back yes after some time and with
sharpness I’m told needing to cut against something
anything to be purposeful given their new forms Woe Woe Woe How a man rides his wife his children
how he’d ride a horse he’ll never have could never give them
unless said horse is immaterial hence not a horse at all   
just muscular as a stallion is as a word is that’s denied
striving families horsepower any engine beyond their
fragile bodies to propel them forward the whole race
forward even if it pits people against a people
even if it means rearing a rear end tender and raw 
 
 I love you tar baby I love you something strong
