
The morning comes and thickening clouds prevail    Hanging like curtains all the horizon roundOr overhead in heavy stillness sail    So still is day it seems like night profoundScarce by the city’s din the air is stirred    And dull and deadened comes its every soundThe cock’s shrill piercing voice subdued is heard    By the thick folds of muffling vapors drowned Dissolved in mists the hills and trees appear    Their outlines lost and blended with the skyAnd well-known objects that to all are near    No longer seem familiar to the eyeBut with fantastic forms they mock the sightAs when we grope amid the gloom of night
