In the dream I enter him
I      the eater of numbers
the black-lipped barcode
of cost have come for him
because he owes me  He
owes me the broken machine
the bone structure gone limp
over leg of time  I      irreverent
as safe sex breathlessly
whispering this is not a threat
but a promise
