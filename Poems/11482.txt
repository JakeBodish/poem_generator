
A woman stepped outside crumbled
into a loose particulate and as the breeze
blew up from the east she scattered her handful
of heart volcanic ash spiraled the highway
and five of her teeth slipped between
her neighbors breasts her neighbor
unbuttoned her blouse to scratch
at her suddenly red and luminous skin 
Days passed  Each day the sun distractedly
drifted from chair to chair each night the stars
old scatterbrains they commiserated 
It didnt rain  Strange the granular woman
thought to herself although I encompassso much I accomplish so little 
Her car sparkled with her hair and bones
her garden thrived  She tried to thinkwhy did this happen what had I eatenwhy was I bothered those old hours
spotted and exotic lizards darted
the gravel flicking through their colors
of skin as one flicks channels on a tv 
She couldnt catch a one  Then as a flock
of sparrows converging for the skull
of an oak all her twittering dust
her brain bone and the dangerous shreds
of her fingers clawed for the skywhat an interesting cloud someone said
