1
Snow fallen another going
gone new come in open
the door
                  each night I grow
young my friends are well
again my life is all
before me
                   each morning
I close a door another door 
2
Cloud on cloud gray
on gray snow fallen
on snow tree on tree
on unleafed tree 
only a river silvered
with thin ice and a slash
of gold in the late gray sky 
3
Grayed snow slush trudge but
snow falling coating filling
in for absence Present 
child with stringed mittens
here to take her place
to take over on
snow showing up air
4
White sky whiter sun brushing
trees with tints of red then
in the distance streaking
mauve gold filling in
between the now filagreed
trees silhouettes against
the now red burning sky 
5
As if letting go dangling down
only down through a cracked
pane a clear pane weeping
beech branches roots
in air only the crack slant-
ing up or last night in sleep’s
play a long red slide sloping down
6
down buildings walls houses
schools no one building only
bombing months of little in
now nothing no one out only
down bodies arms legs in Gaza
where the eyeless man tore pillars
house himself the people down
7
On this day this birthday I wish
myself for the first time who
would be a child again back
at that dining room table with
him his years of little more less
back not as in the note in her
birthday book died 84 yrs of age 
8
snow          rain             ice
stand         walk            fall
little           more           less
face            flesh            hand
will             is                 was
oh               yes              no
melt           rain             snow
9
Off the page sliding or
I brush or don’t see
you but without
you so cold colder
than stooped-by-age
shoulder oh flesh hand
Love come turn my page 
10
Tempered by age passion rage
cool no lost sleep 
                                    while in sleep
they burn again your fine hand
igniting my thigh live birds
crushed under my feet
                                          then
morning grays again aged
back writing died    of age
11
As body to body fall-
ing together we burn
again snow drifts
in air turns rolls
almost horizontal
takes its own slow
time off from falling
12
Gun to body shell to body bombs
to bodies
                  three five now nine
hundred bodies over two hundred
children’s bodies
                                over the border
to Gaza to close the already closed
border
              not to meet border to border
a border has no body is only a side 
13
Epiphany missed not the seen but the comingto see or star the minister said light sensed
against the dark but not even the dark
night or the cold bright snow
roof over the roof below the darkness
before  only gray industrial gunmetal
battleship slate gray and the coming of gray
14
Friend Sleep has betrayed me I’m trapped
in a castle with villainess villain two
doors open a third slams down before
the darkness I’m trapped in a room my
friends accuse me I hide my sheets I cannot
tell them I’m dying and then awaking I’m
hurting why these dreams my betraying self
15
In sleep a holocaust rations trapped
in a kitchen ovens coming why not eat them if food is scarce 
                                           In Gaza food
is scarce power lost the UN Compound
a hospital hit today now over 1000 dead 
But see here History the Future some
hope though still rationed is Coming Soon

House on the train 
18
On his way to the Capitol largely built by slaves
who baked bricks cut laid stone 
                                                              on his way
to stand before the Mall where slaves were held
in pens and sold 
                                   on his way to a White
House partly built by slaves where another
resident after his Proclamation wroteIf slavery is not wrong nothing is wrong 
19One hundred years later King said
and said to the crowd on the MallNow is the time and We can never be satisfied as long as he
dreamed every valley exalted all these years untilnot an end they said a beginning
20
O bless hold help keep
him safe let him help
us through this cold
let us help him help
us through this
cold let its end be
O yes a beginning 
21
Cold is in the air troops are finally out
of Gaza where 1300 dead are on or in
the ground where olive trees are up-
rooted down spoons a coloring
book limbs shoes in the rubble In the depths of winter he said 
Today he is In at work 
22
White roof over the roof white
branches clinging to branches even
the still fallen snow is moving even
icicles shift toward dripping nothing
not even the cold bodies we are
becoming is not moving not even
the ground is not moving over on
23
Beyond my windowed
wall gray clouds move over
clouds
             beyond the Wall
that grays Gaza dust
over dust of disturbed
bodies
              wall with drawn-
in windows winter mirror

to ground leaves
the beautiful skeletal
limbs open to only

He stumbled but still she blundered
but still they said what they shouldn’t
have said and recovered of course
they are the great but even the small
though all we early learn may fall
may leave the mistaken misspoken
behind as late we stumble into our selves
