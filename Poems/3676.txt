
some say
Im now almost
extinct in this park
but the people
who say this
dont know
that by smelling
the orchids
in the trees
theyre sensing
the fragrance
of my chops
that by hearing
the rumbling
of the waterfalls
theyre listening
to my ancestors
great roar
that by observing
the constellations
of the night sky
theyre gazing
at the star spots
on my fur
that I am and
always will be
the wild
untamed
living spirit
of this jungle
