
I don’t know  I still can’t get it right the way those dirt roads cut across the flatsand led to shacks where hounds and muddy shoatsskulked roundabouts  Describing it sounds triteas hell the good old South I love to hate The truth What’s that How should I knowI stayed inside too much  I learned to boastof stupid things  I kept my ears shut tightas we kept doors locked windows lockedthe curtains drawn  Now I know why  The dark could hide things from us  Dark could seewhat we could not  Sometimes those dirt roads shockedme where they ended up I watched a dog diein the ditch  The man who shot him winked at me
