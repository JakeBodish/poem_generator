Avenge O Lord thy slaughterd saints whose bones        Lie scatterd on the Alpine mountains cold        Evn them who kept thy truth so pure of old        When all our fathers worshippd stocks and stones Forget not in thy book record their groans        Who were thy sheep and in their ancient fold        Slain by the bloody Piemontese that rolld        Mother with infant down the rocks  Their moans The vales redoubld to the hills and they        To Heavn  Their martyrd blood and ashes sow        Oer all th Italian fields where still doth sway The triple tyrant that from these may grow        A hundred-fold who having learnt thy way Early may fly the Babylonian woe
