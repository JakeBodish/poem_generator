
Look in my face my name is Might-have-been
     I am also calld No-more Too-late Farewell
     Unto thine ear I hold the dead-sea shellCast up thy Lifes foam-fretted feet betweenUnto thine eyes the glass where that is seen
     Which had Lifes form and Loves but by my spell
     Is now a shaken shadow intolerableOf ultimate things unutterd the frail screen Mark me how still I am But should there dart
     One moment through thy soul the soft surprise
     Of that wingd Peace which lulls the breath of sighs Then shalt thou see me smile and turn apartThy visage to mine ambush at thy heart
     Sleepless with cold commemorative eyes
