
Remember after work you grabbed our skateboard
crouched like a surfer wingtips over the edge
wheels clacketing down the pocked macadam
you veered almost straight into the neighbors hedge
We ran after you laughing shouting Wait
Or that August night you swept us to the fair
The tallest person boarding the Ferris wheel
you rocked our car right when we hit the apex
above the winking midway to make us squeal 
Next we raced you to the games shouting Wait
At your funeral relatives and neighbors
shaking our hands said So young to have died
But weve dreamt youre just skating streets away
striding the fairgrounds toward a wilder ride 
And were still straggling behind shouting Wait
