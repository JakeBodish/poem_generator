I’ll tell you if you really want to knowremember that day you lost two years agoat the rockpool where you sat and played the jewelerwith all those stones you’d stolen from the shoreMost of them went dark and nothing morebut sometimes one would blink the secret colorit had locked up somewhere in its stony sleep This is how you knew the ones to keep So I collect the dull things of the dayin which I see some possibilitybut which are dead and which have the surpriseI don’t know and I’ve no pool to help me tell so I look at them and look at them untilone thing makes a mirror in my eyesthen I paint it with the tear to make it bright This is why I sit up through the night
