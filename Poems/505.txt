
 I  ADMIRAL
 
Laid out on vellum the past
is a long wound  It unfolds
five centuries later
beneath the heavy pens of scholars 
The world shifts and spins
as the Admirals bronze astrolabe
measures the paths between stars 
The sky is written in the seas
uneasy mirror and mermaids
comb their hair in the distance They are not he writes so beautifulas I have heard  He dreams of his own
circuitous route to the Heavens 
God and the Crown  Both want too much 
 
II  GOVERNOR
 
At Guanahani they swam to the caravel
bearing parrots and balls of cotton thread
these people so unlike him they could not
not be saved 
                        Too angry to sleep
the Governor haunts every room in his castle 
The servants whisper in their own tongue 
 
The severed hands of the Taino
wave in clear salt water
in pink-tinted water 
They wave as the gold mines dry up
as the Governor leaves Hispaniola in chains 
 
Mermaids dog-headed men and women
with breastplates of copper 
They draw their bows and arrows
cover the shore of Columbuss dream 
No not the Taino whom he once called in dios 
They touch his white skin 
They have the faces of Christian angels
