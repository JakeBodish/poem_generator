I was eight when the blackout struck and the lights died all across the city
like a massacre of fireflies  In the projects of Brooklyn I steered myself
to 14F fingers spread against the cool tiles of the hallway past the concrete
and chicken-wire terrace where I once burnt ants with a magnifying glass 
Many years later at the Chinese restaurant uptown Jack said They got any flan here He was my first poet  I had seen the fireflies in his sonnets
blink and float away Fulano the philosopher in the unemployment line
Blanco the painter painting in the madhouse Monterosa the dealer killed
by shotgun in a bar on Avenue A his mother the seamstress and the quick
needle of her sewing machine Jack the moving man his hands sliced raw 
He stacked his apartment with dictionaries in three languages  I knew
the raconteur’s grin with every tale Raúl Juliá is a friend of minea Puerto Rican playing Macbeth  He took 14 curtain calls on opening night 
Maybe he would tell me now that flan was not Puerto Rican or Mexican
or Spanish but Chinese invented by a trembling cook to satisfy the palate
of an emperor in the Ming Dynasty  No flan Jack I said  This is a Chinese restaurant  Two minutes later he said They got any flan I showed him
the dog-eared and fingerprinted menu  No flan I said  When the waiter
unfurled his pad Jack said to him You got flan He sang this song for an hour 
The egg roll was not flan  The fried rice was not flan  The fortune cookie
was not flan  Can we get some flan he said  Goddammit Jack I said 
The poets crowded into the bar striding to the mic  Jack stood with poem
in hand read the title tilted his head and said it again studied the page
as if the words shriveled up like ants burnt under a magnifying glass
then sat down  I witnessed the massacre of fireflies  A few of us clapped
not knowing what to do with our hands staring at the sonneteer who lost
all his quatrains and couplets in the denim jacket he left on the subway
the words of Fulano still waiting on the unemployment line The faster you spin the stiller you look   There’s something to learn in that but what
After the diagnosis I handed Jack a book of poems  He dangled the book
upside down like a stiff mouse by the tail something we would sniff  behind
the refrigerator  I wanted sonnets  Jack kept singing the chorus of a songGet me to the church  Get me to the church  Get me to the church on time  
At the end I leaned over Jack’s bed to read his own poem in his ear but some
words come home after the blackout fingers crawling on the wall  I know
what I should have said at the Chinese restaurant Jack let’s get some flan 
We should have braved the subway at rush hour straphangers rocking
all the way to 14th Street and 8th Avenue to La Taza de Oro gone now
like Jack for rice and beans squid in its own ink café con leche y flan
Jack a spoonful of flan for you after all the years of sonnets and bread
for me the steam rising when your hands cracked the crust at the table
