
I take the snap from the center fake to the right fade back   
Ive got protection  Ive got a receiver open downfield   
What the hell is this This isnt a football its a shoe a mans
brown leather oxford  A cousin to a football maybe the same
skin but not the same a thing made for the earth not the air 
I realize that this is a world where anything is possible and I
understand also that one often has to make do with what one
has  I have eaten pancakes for instance with that clear corn
syrup on them because there was no maple syrup and they
werent very good  Well anyway this is different  My man
downfield is waving his arms  One has certain responsibilities
one has to make choices  This isnt right and Im not going
to throw it
