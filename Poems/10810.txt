
Seated once by a brook watching a childChiefly that paddled I was thus beguiled Mellow the blackbird sang and sharp the thrushNot far off in the oak and hazel brushUnseen  There was a scent like honeycombFrom mugwort dull  And down upon the domeOf the stone the cart-horse kicks against so oftA butterfly alighted  From aloftHe took the heat of the sun and from below On the hot stone he perched contented soAs if never a cart would pass againThat way as if I were the last of menAnd he the first of insects to have earthAnd sun together and to know their worth I was divided between him and the gleamThe motion and the voices of the streamThe waters running frizzled over gravelThat never vanish and for ever travel A grey flycatcher silent on a fenceAnd I sat as if we had been there sinceThe horseman and the horse lying beneathThe fir-tree-covered barrow on the heathThe horseman and the horse with silver shoesGalloped the downs last  All that I could loseI lost  And then the child’s voice raised the dead “No one’s been here before” was what she saidAnd what I felt yet never should have foundA word for while I gathered sight and sound
