
O Friend I know not which way I must lookFor comfort being as I am opprestTo think that now our life is only drestFor show mean handy-work of craftsman cookOr groom   We must run glittering like a brookIn the open sunshine or we are unblestThe wealthiest man among us is the bestNo grandeur now in nature or in bookDelights us  Rapine avarice expenseThis is idolatry and these we adorePlain living and high thinking are no moreThe homely beauty of the good old causeIs gone our peace our fearful innocenceAnd pure religion breathing household laws
