
Wheal Emma and Brookwood are abandoned copper mines whose remains are located near Buckfastleigh within the Dartmoor National Park an area with a long history of widespread industrial activity  From this one locality in the second half of the nineteenth century more than thirty thousand tons of copper ore were raised processed and shipped for smelting  In 1859 in order to stabilize and increase the power supply Wheal Emma Leat a fifteen-mile-long channel was cut across moorland and around woodland valleys to transport water from the River Swincombe and to feed the mines by supplementing the Mardle a tributary of the Dart  Some of this now empty moorland waterway can be walked today on Dartmoor  I am grateful to Kevin and Donna Cox owners of the Brook Manor estate for showing my collaborator Ignacio Acosta and me over the remains of mine workings on their land 

Widening the plug doorway
on the bob wall left no
surface evidence  The Mardle
has a floodplain fair and wide 
Material would have been
trammed directly although
blacked ochreous water flows
freely from the collapsed
portal  Humphrey kept Kevin
back when we went into
the near horizontal dark adit
stooped at the panic shaft 
In Brook Wood at the combe
head is a small killas quarry
predating all three setts 
Rent was paid to the Brook Wood
adventurers  Three areas of
dumping partially covered
this crumbled masonry within
woodland of varying density
just south of the tarmac road 
Yet a leat is depicted on the
1886 OS map channeled entirely
in a raised wooden aqueduct

Then buildings fall into decay
where ivy and tree growth
have taken hold  The silted channel
follows the contour round hills
and combes using the best-fit
method to Wheal Emma sett 
Whereas conifer scrub and dense
patches of rhododendron
are seen quite late in the sequence 
All 99 stations were used and
having passed over the wheel
water may have been diverted 
The long wheelhouse sides are not
straight but slightly kinked to provide
for a dished 60-ft wheel
over an arched tailrace exit
at floor level  In this same evening
were those people engaged to feast
on roast beef and strong ale nearby 
Within the valley of the holy brook
the mines are situated near
Buckfastleigh crushed ores are hauled
for the South Wales copper smelters
Alfred Jenkin their agent in Cornwall 
Over and over had they been
in the heaven of expectation
finding the ore ground pitched eastward
those who gambled their lives in swift
currents and dark treacherous pools 
Granting two properties as
one sett at a royalty of 124
together with fine machinery
wheels a beam engine and water
privileges  One hundred and twenty-
five workers being then separated
only by a small transverse valley 
The flat rods moved off so quietly
that those not looking were unconscious
of their being in motion  Steam was
employed only at limited scale 
Emma 116 fathoms below adit
pumping backed-up water for life itself
men cutting lode in fume- and dust-ridden air
or crushing with hand tools spalling cobbing
came our tramroad to harbor direct
in Totnes and thence by sea to Neath   
no more windlass or horse-whim turning 
What you see here is the dressing floor 
Their Phoenician purple dye   
their copper with fifteen percent
Cornish tin  Remember when
a solid solution of
metal elements was defined
by ecstatic bonding 
Water poured over its surface
producing hydrogen gas 
The new material is
stable and ready for use
but scaled-up production
could fuel cannibal drones

We love the color and
the stillness  Nothing would
live in this water now
at the base of a spoil heap
two stories high  Worm casts
and broadly scattered pits
are laminated onto a
non-conductive substrate 
This is the green pool
a water soak away
made from glass epoxy 
They are brown and green
like uneven flat loaves
and the museum label
reads tortas de cobre 
Moss grows on anything
like black flame retardant
mechanically supports and
electrically connects   
the fenced-off shaft
protecting the river
from what leaches out
between sea-borne traders 
At these horizons the levels were
extended over 330 fathoms 
Small groups of self-employed
miners and their families
continued to migrate  Here was
alluvial gold mixed with
sand and gravel producing
more than 14 heads of stamps were
capable of crushing  Composed
of quartz peach and gossan with black
and yellow copper letting down
a stream of mineralized water 
For in much of this section
the leat had been cut from
solid rock  A stone-lined sluice
is just visible  4000 shares
on the cost book system
streamworks in eluvial ground
5 shillings each deposit  Nothing
but a washing strake such as
we use commodified and priced
both minerals since the Bronze Age
in West Devon in Cornwall
beneath a layer of black sand 
An adit is also brought home
to the spot from below narrow
tailings in steep profile cast
every shovel full as it rises
into a tye  £40000 worth
of copper ore from above
the 50-fathom level 
Water breaks up the soil exposing
mere threads of land linear strips
cut into channels called races
dug across the ground to be worked
removing the overburden
