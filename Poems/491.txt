
and you press into the dark imagine
the stranger two rows back that fragile
chance you’ll forget in the second trailer 
 
Now it’s quiet still
this burden of being watcher and screen
and what floats across it–light pouring out
 
its time and necklines and train wrecks 
What a relief to yield to the EXIT
sign red “I” blinking like a candle 
 
Soon the enormous figures moving
across rooms the emphatic narrative
arcs  There’s the thrum of the subway
 
its engine of extras  Here now
the beginning of trivia tests  Warning puppets
with brown-bag faces and fringy hair 
 
You’re almost here  But what you want
is the after  How yourself you are now
walking into the night full moon over Houston Street
 
at the bright fruit stand touching the yellow
mums  Here you are Woman with Cilantro
listening to the rattle of the wrap
 
the paper sound paper makes after you
have heard movie paper  Apples are more apples 
Paper more paper  Cilantro its sweaty green self
