
My husbands out-of-town so I set
Our house on fire  Champagne
And eggs asparagus for breakfast 
Water for lunch  I eat dinner early
In the late afternoon while the wind
Disorganizes leaves leaving me
To clean them up  I think that the
Imaginations guided by logic 
A hand thats used to translating
Images of rain to snow  Error-filled
The night destroys the details of
Poems the pearls worn by Beethoven
In secret the rocks H D  mistook
For seaweed as she walked
In exaltation toward the beach  Is it
Possible to sing the imagination
Into being And is it possible for us
To valorize autumn by cloaking in
Difficult language the paths of stars
Geraniums they make entractes
Out of air as I walk past them 
Always these goddamn leaves
And acorns shat on our house by
The goddamn oak  One of us will fail
The other will plagiarize language
From the other thats certain 
Acorns are beautiful only to those
Whove never had to clean them up
