
Yea gold is son of Zeus no rust     Its timeless light can stain The worm that brings mans flesh to dust     Assaults its strength in vain More gold than gold the love I singA hard inviolable thing Men say the passions should grow old      With waning years my heart Is incorruptible as gold      Tis my immortal part Nor is there any god can layOn love the finger of decay
