
I’ve stopped asking                                                       ¿Why
             I’ve let a man whistle
                           from the table for more beer
 brought it to him
                           with a smile  I’ve slapped
a man  ran
                           while he laughed   
             atrevida 
I’ve had a miscarriage  I’ve let a man
                                       kiss me
after an abortion
                                        comforted his hot tears 
I’ve done these things
                                                       while other girls
work in maquilas
                           piecing together
Dell computer boards
                                       while other girls
work in brothels
                            cake foundation across
their bruised arms
                                       while other girls
                           ride the bus home alone
             at night every night
while other girls are found
             wearing clothes
                           that don’t belong to them or no
clothes at all  I’ve done all of this
                                       while other girls are found
                           with puta
                                       written in blood across
their broken bellies 
             My mother used to cover
my eyes
                           when we’d walk by girls
working the corner
              say
                                       See how lucky you arenot to have to work
                           like they do I have been
             muy puta
                                       have been called puta Yes I’d say very lucky
