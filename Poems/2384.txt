In a courtyard in these stacks of chairs
            before the empty stage near arewe Lord near and graspable  Lord
            accept these humble offerings
stacks of biscuits wrapped in cellophane
            stacks of bone in glass thighbone
spine  Stacks of white saucers porcelain
            circles into which stacks of lip-worn
cups slide neat  Jawbone Lord  Galleries
            of laminated clippings declaring war 
Hands unstack chairs into rows  The dead
            they still go begging
