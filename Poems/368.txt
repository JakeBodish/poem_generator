
I still see those men haphazardly standing
around the comps’ floor mostly silent
lost in their latest urgent jobs
looking up and down as if nodding yes
 
from what they call their composers’ sticks
as they set inverse words and lines
of each page that could be taken for
Greek scripture declaring
 
In the beginning was the Word and the Word
was made cold type and the Word was
coldness darkness shiny greyness
and light and the Word dwelt amongst us 
 
                                      
 
Oh I know these men would laugh this off 
They’d say if they simply didn’t throw
their eyes to heaven that they were just ordinary
characters trying to keep the devil from the door
 
and with luck have enough left over each week
to back a few nags and go for a few jars 
But they can’t say anything or set anything now 
They are scattered from that place that’s not
 
the same any more and many have left
any place we know of in this life
calling to mind the old names for printingThe Mysterious Craft or simply The Mystery 
 
                                          
 
I set them up in another city another country
that’s as far away in distance
from that city as it’s far in time 
But they are still composing
 
cracking the odd joke above
their sticks and galleys on some floor
of some building that is eternally busy
inside me even when I’ve forgotten
 
that I’ve forgotten them forgetting
the world behind the word 
every time I read the word world I wonder
is it a typo and should I delete the l 
 
                                          
 
Now again I hanker to know the quality
of each letter the weight the texture the smell
the shiny new type the ink-dark shades of old
the different types of type the various sizes
 
within the same font the measures in ems
picas  points and units  I’d set the words up
making something out of all this
that stays standing all set as masterly
 
as the words those men set that reveal
something of the mystery behind
and within these letters and the wonder and
the darkness but with the lightest touch 
 
                                          
And the umpteen ways things can foul up
are beyond telling  Maybe the type is off
or the typesetter may not be up
to the work if only out of a hangover
 
setting an  where there should be a 
or a b where there should be a d
or miss aspace or a line or dingbat 
And the proofreaders dont catch the error
 
passing the copy on as clean or the make-up man
fouls the assembly page or the stoneman errs
as he fastens the page of cold type and furniture
with the chase turning the quoin’s key 
 
                                          
 
Not to speak of the evil eye cast by
fellow composers ready
to knock the words of others or the bosses
writing on the composition Kill 
 
Old Shades keep my words from such eyes
and fretting about that pied world and let me go
on regardless  And even if I foul up and the stewards
are right to set Kill on my last page and my words
 
are distributed and thrown in the hellbox
the real achievement will be that I tried to set
the words right that I did it with much labor
and not without a font of love  But that said
 
                                          
 
grant me the skill to free the leaden words
from the words I set undo their awkwardness
the weight of each letter of each word
so that the words disappear fall away
 
or are forgotten and what remains is the metal
of feeling and thought behind
and beyond the cast of words
dissolving in their own ink wash 
 
Within this solution we find ourselves
meeting only here through The Mystery
but relieved nonetheless to meet if only
behind the characters of one fly-boy’s words
