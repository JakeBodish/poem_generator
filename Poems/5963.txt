
It wasn’t a man That knocked me down With the thrill of a sliceOf my will  She was mannish Chilled flungHer will acrossMine then laughedAt my shock when sheGripped my neck whileLingering over a requestFor the evening meal  Later I sliced a tomatoClose to my wrist  The door was open  She had warned me Never shut it againstHer  Otherwise I was free to come And go  Maybe she wasRight I was zero To the bone  MeanwhileI had left the hose In the pond  The goldfishCowered in the reeds  Whose side were they onI am ill I thought Slogging acrossSoggy green If I bow any lowerI will be looking upAt moss
