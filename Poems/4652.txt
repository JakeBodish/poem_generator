
I’m going to look at my watch
though I don’t really care what time it is 
Just slightly curious 
It’s funny when you see
it’s much earlier or later
than you thought
but even funnier when it’s exactly
the time you thought 
But at my back etc Etc  being
“Desarts of vast Eternity ”
I give up 
It’s eleven eleven 
What ever happens
at eleven eleven
Vast eternity
