
We swing ungirded hipsAnd lightened are our eyesThe rain is on our lipsWe do not run for prize We know not whom we trustNor whitherward we fareBut we run because we must    Through the great wide air The waters of the seasAre troubled as by storm The tempest strips the treesAnd does not leave them warm Does the tearing tempest pauseDo the tree-tops ask it whySo we run without a cause    Neath the big bare sky The rain is on our lipsWe do not run for prize But the storm the water whipsAnd the wave howls to the skies The winds arise and strike itAnd scatter it like sandAnd we run because we like it    Through the broad bright land
