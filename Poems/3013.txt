
It seems a certain fear underlies everything 
If I were to tell you something profound
it would be useless as every single thing I know
is not timeless  I am particularly risk-averse 
I choose someone else over me every time
as Im sure theyll finish the task at hand
which is to say that whatever is in front of us
will get done if Im not in charge of it 
There is a limit to the number of times
I can practice every single kind of mortification
of the flesh  I can turn toward you and say yes
it was you in the poem
