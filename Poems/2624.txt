Only a man harrowing clods    In a slow silent walkWith an old horse that stumbles and nods    Half asleep as they stalk                         II
Only thin smoke without flame    From the heaps of couch-grassYet this will go onward the same    Though Dynasties pass                         III
Yonder a maid and her wight    Come whispering byWar’s annals will cloud into night    Ere their story die
