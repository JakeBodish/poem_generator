
I remember that store and the nasty redneck whose stink
seemed a challenge to everyone in it  The scene
is decades old but Im still confused that no one
took up the challenge including me though I liked
an occasional fight back then  The prospect of pain
meant less to me once I guess  An aneurism
had just killed my brother so the pain Im talking about
was my bodys  I breathed up another pain that day 
I checked the mans beat pickup why would he want them
those skunks knee-deep in its bed I left the lot
still more confused my sweet retriever shivering
on the seat beside me  The godawful smell still clung
to the dogs wet coat and my own  Thered be no more hikes
for us that morning rain had arrived bone-chilling 
If you killed a skunk why would you keep the thing
To kill some time I stopped at The Jackpot View 
Weve always called it that  Five mountaintops bled
into mists to my east in New Hampshire  The sudden squalls
spilled leaves on the woods-floors pall of nondescript hue 
Now he was dead  Now my brother was dead 
I cant define any God but only this morning
I caught a whiff of road-killed skunk and thought
I could speak of Him or Her or It as surely
as I could tell you the slightest thing concerning
the man Im remembering now the one who shot
or trapped or clubbed those miserable reeking creatures 
The smallest enigmas we ever encounter remain
as hard to explain as all the epical ones 
Ive failed for years to fathom the death of my brother
but its just as hard to understand why a scene
in an old Vermont store should linger like dead-skunk odor
which if youve lately been tainted comes back to scent you
whenever a rain blows in or like some pains
you may have thought youd forever gotten over
but which at some odd prompting come back to haunt you
