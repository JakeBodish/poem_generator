
yum yum the stars are out  Ill never forget how you
smelled that night  like cheddar cheese melting
under fluorescent light  like a day-old rainbow fish 
what a dish  gotta lick my lips  gotta dream I day-
dream  thorozine brain cloud  rain rain comes com-
ing down

getting soaking wet  hope her petticoats shrink 
well little shepherd girl your gonna kingdom come 
looking so clean  the guardian of every little lamb

Im gonna peep in bos bodice  lay down darling dont
be modest let me slip my hand in  ohhh thats soft
