
Reader unmov’d and Reader unshaken Reader unseduc’d   
and unterrified through the long-loud and the sweet-still   
I creep toward you  Toward you I thistle and I climb 
I crawl Reader servile and cervine through this blank   
season counting I sleep and I sleep  I sleep
Reader toward you loud as a cloud and deaf Reader deaf
as a leaf  Reader Why don’t you turn
pale
