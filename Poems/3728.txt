
Stuck pat with strawberry magnets
to her sub-zero are all the stages
gill slits lungs sex stopped
at the third month when the fetus
is sucked out into a clear plastic bag 
Reaching in for a quick soda you can almost
feel that flexible wind on your face 
The fetus named Jennifer it says
develops in color-photo sequence till the second
trimester when more bold-face the kids
a murder victim in cold blood of Mom  You beckon
to nothing milk cartons cans stand in the chill blast
of the suction door and grab your Sprite 
Day and night she stands outside the clinics
with the other Lifers  My advice dont
take her on  I once learned phylogeny
provides intelligent options but survival
does not always select for insight 
Down the line theres a smug printed
sign talking up adoption Right 
So knocked up Id owe my body to
an forgiving god whod swallow my offspring
t00 Heres a fat man rattling a blood red
genie in a pickle jar  No wedding ring 
See that woman head bent theyre hurrying her
through the police cordon past the screaming faces
Ive walked where shes walking now 
and where she lies now I once lay
behind that secured door near that white
waiting table  My mind divided momentarily
as if the world were just birth or no birth
what I could or could not do and still seem
human to myself  Who first fixed in
my head that slashed membrane between life
and death Id go toe-to-toe against her
but she stops me cold with her small past due
figure of remorse  God what next  she asks
leaning against her icebox her T-shirt
shouting how she pities the unborn  So do I 
But not as much as I pity her quickening
with hate  And love for those would-be
lives inbred to a set of family
gestures  One day on our way to the frog
pond we take my daughters hands saying
nothing one on each side  She
asks me why I dont see what she believes 
I want to say I do I see through all the cross-
wielding apologists to why she alone in her kitchen grieves 
Its sad  The big frogs croak like TV preachers
pad to pad  But look at the pond rim
she points out tadpoles hundredsm ink-black legless 
See we both say  My daughter kneels tries to cup them
in her fist but theyre too fast  Born again and
again into the limits of our perception they swim
intuitively the way we think  She calls that
revelation  Were surrounded by the bull
chorus a booming backlit percussion  Call
it revelation
