
 sorry this not that poem
raised block flower  plant bed 
  peonies gardenias poinsettias
plus a yellow orb slow-rising
  over an endless golden scape 
darting through uncluttered space
  cardinals thrashes sparrows
blue air fragrant with lavender
  washing brain matter into virtue 
if only i could pastel language
  onto a canvas of thistledown
yes deceit comes to mind 
   a lie  traitor  turncoat  recreant
backstabber to truth i would be
  gut-shanked a thousand times 
this is not that poem nor am i
  that poet to hold your hand
 or  erase knot-hole screams
  blood on a cement floor  or 
suicide is another form of escape
  no-no-no but i do promise
the evil-ugly humans inflict
  to each other to their selves
how time is malice is death
  enflaming pupils with spite
inextinguishable if ever set free 
  forgive state poet 289-128
for not scribbling illusions
  of trickery as if timeless hell
could be captured by stanzas
  alliteration or slant rhyme
