She would
sigh if she
could think of
anything intolerable 
her numbers
fold in
planes she can
not describe 
Does she
close her eyes for
that faint
red of processes
Come to me
by instinct or
for mathematics’
sake 
 
 
2
She
moves
in a metaphor of
action 
Heaven she
says is
hell
remembered 
Outside her
gaze I’m
stranded
on fraudulent heights 
No
tune I
know is far
enough out 
 
 
3
Man is a matter of
walking
upright but she
suggests happiness 
Her whole
power
is one the side
of vagueness 
Everything I
need to
know about her is
just before me 
What
can I learn
that is not already
gone
 
 
4
Mountains rule
the world because
she’s
from the hills 
When she stands
perpendicular to the
sun’s rays her
light is confined 
If she
turns
the objective
weakens 
We shall not all
rise but
all
be modified 
 
 
5
I see her
long after
she has
gone away 
There are whole
systems
she
doesn’t respond to 
If you
look long enough
everything
is hydraulics 
Out of a
series of partial
images she is the
one that detaches 
 
 
6
If I could
remember
her we
might build 
Will my
words be fan-
tastic enough to
count
Whatever
happens now we
have been
opposite 
Please believe me
I would
seek you if I
had the distance 
 
 
7
Given
time and
invention she
will surface 
She will
scratch
meditate and some
story will suffer 
I refuse to
believe
things unsupported necessarily
fall 
She deprives my
dreams
of un-
reality 
 
 
8
The hardest
step to take is
always the
next 
She is written
across
her
face 
We are
what we
are momentary
coincidence 
She is
body
speaking
through body 
 
 
9
She will claim for
instance King
Solomon planted
baobabs in India 
And it
may
be
true 
A fine long
rain
penetrates farther
than storms 
Food is
necessary
and
 also logic 
 
 
10
Sometimes I’m
angry and
not at
anything in particular 
She has
seven
divisions but
no borders 
I could
change your name since
you always
wanted to be fictional 
Another
unsolved
dream under
the bridge
 
 
11
She has it would
seem no
natural
inclination to rise 
She is
whatever I
cannot get
rid of 
She’s whatever
refuses
to be
information 
She is my
absence
my only secure
reference 
 
 
12
Just when I’m
ready to let
go satisfaction
is satisfaction 
Curious text where
we’re commanded to acquire
Nirvana 
Nothing but
impatience
could prompt our
abrupt recognition 
she says virginity
of the mind
can be
restored 
 
 
13
Let me
not praise
her past her
due 
She is
a heap of
pebbles
in exquisite random 
Her laughter
rings
empty where there
were crowds 
My arms
around
you my
love are phantoms 
 
 
14
She appears sometimes
to be talking
about
other data 
It is as
if she
knew a separate
category 
I tell
her weeping’s
no proof
of the resurrection 
All
of her is
curved
and alters 
 
 
15
She can
only
be pictured
as catastrophe 
She con-
fuses
concepts with
irony 
Her thought spreads
like
children
running home 
She
finds comfort in
the most outrageous
limbs 
 
 
16
The moon according
to her is
a symbol
for shine 
Residues
provide the
passion
of thought 
Her reflexes
condition
my
mythology 
She is the
energy
of my
indexes 
 
 
17
When she
snarls at
me my
senses sharpen 
Who could expect
her
without
lying
She is a
color
outside
the octave 
Her rituals
divide my
life
from its labors 
 
 
18
She makes
the right
answer
sound foolish 
The righteous
glory
in their un-
certainty 
Two
nuts represent
us in
divination 
The only
thing she
comes home in
is twilight 
 
 
19
She sits
in the
street making
detours 
Her history is
rich
in in-
decisions 
She is
present
inclusive
untransformed 
I do not
pretend
to know
how the flood came 
 
 
20
A hymn
describes the
monotony
of her expectations 
She was
created
from the sweat
of peacocks 
Children
defend themselves
with shame
and experience 
All her
objects
answer to the
same name 
 
 
21
Better a blank
wall than
simple
dark 
The play in
her muscle de-
termines
where my eyes focus 
She
sleeps at
the curve
of my spine 
She wouldn’t
believe
me if I
were to tell her
