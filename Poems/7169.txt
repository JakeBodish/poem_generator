Give me Great God said I a Little Farmin Summer shady  in Winter warmwhere a cool spring gives birth to a clear brookby Nature slideing down a mossy RockNot artfully in Leaden Pipes conveydOr greatly falling in a forcd CascadePure  unsullyd winding throu ye Shade All bounteous Heaven has added to my Praiera softer Climate and a purer Air Our Frozen Isle now chilling Winter bindsDeformd by Rains  rough wth blasting Windsye witherd Woods grown white wth hoary Frostby driving storms their scatterd beautys lostThe Trembling birds their leaveless coverts shunAnd seek in distant Climes a warmer SunThe Water Nymphs their silenced Urns deploreEven Thames benumbd a River now no moreThe barren Meadows give no more delightby Glistning Snows made painfull to ye Sight Here Summer reigns wth one Eternal SmileAnd double Harvests bless ye happy Soil Fair fertile Fields to warm Indulgent HeavenHas every Charm of every Season givenNo Killing Cold deforms ye Beauteous YearThe springing Flowers no coming Winter FearBut as ye Parent Rose decays  diesye Infant Buds wth brighter Colours riseAnd with fresh sweets ye Mother-scent supplysNear them the Vilet glows wth odours blestAnd blooms in more than Tyrian Purple drestThe rich Jonquils their golden gleam displayAnd shine in glorys emulateing day These chearfull Groves their living Leaves retainThe Streams still murmur undefild by RainAnd growing Green adorns ye Fruitfull PlainThe warbling Kind uninterrupted SingWarmd wth Enjoyment of perpetual Spring Here from my Window I at once surveyThe crouded City  resounding SeaIn distant Views see Assian Mountains riseAnd Lose their Snowy Summits in ye Skies Above those Mountains high Olympus TowrsThe Parliamental Seat of Heavenly Powers New to ye Sight my ravishd Eyes admireEach guilded Crescent  each Antique SpireThe Fair Serail where sunk in Idle easeThe Lazy Monarch melts his thoughtless daysThe Marble Mosques beneath whose Ample DomesFierce Warlike Sultans sleep in peacefull TombsThose lofty Structures once the Christian boastTheir Names their Honnours  their Beautys lostThose Altars bright wth Gold wth Sculpture gracdBy barbarous Zeal of savage Foes defacdConvents where Emperors professd of oldThe Labourd Pillars that their Triumphs told Vain Monuments of Men that once were greatSunk undistinguishd by one Common FateHow art thou falln Imperial City LowWhere are thy Hopes of Roman Glory nowWhere are thy Palaces by Prelates raisdWhere preistly Pomp in Purple Lustre blazdSo vast that Youthfull Kings might there resideSo Splendid to content a Patriarchs prideWhere Grecian Artists all their skill displaydBefore ye happy Sciences decaydSo vast that Youthfull Kings might there resideSo Splendid to content a Patriarchs PrideConvents where Emperors proffessd of OldThe Labourd Pillars that their Triumphs toldVain Monuments of Men that once were greatSunk undistinguishd in one common FateOne Little Spot the small Fenar containsOf Greek Nobillity the poor RemainsWhere other Helens show like powerfull CharmsAs once engagd the Warring World in ArmsThose Names that Roial Auncestry can boastIn mean Mechanic Arts obscurely lostThose Eyes a second Homer might inspirefixd at the Loom destroy their useless Fire Greivd at a view which strikes vpon my MindThe short livd Vanity of Human kindIn Gaudy Objects I indulge my SightAnd turn where Eastern Pomp gives gay delight See the vast Train in various Habits dressdBy the Bright Seymetar and Sable VestThe Vizier proud distinguishd ore the restSix slaves in gay Attire his Bridle holdHis Bridle rough with Gems his Stirups GoldHis Snowy Steed adornd with lavish PrideWhole Troops of Soldiers mounted by his SideThese toss the Plumy Crest Arabian Coursers guide With awfull Duty all decline their EyesNo bellowing Shouts of noisy Crouds ariseSilence in solemn State the march attendsTill at the dread Divan the slow processions ends Yet not these Objects all profusely GayThe Gilded Navy that adorns the SeaThe riseing City in Confusion fairMagnificently formd irregularWhere Woods and Palaces at once surpriseGardens on Gardens Domes on Domes ariseAnd endless Beauties tire the wandering EyesSo sooths my Wishes or so charms my MindAs this Retreat secure from Human kind No Knaves successfull Craft does Spleen exciteNo Coxcombs tawdry Splendour shocks my SightNo Mob Alarm awakes my Female FearsNo unrewarded Merit asks my TearsNor Praise my Mind nor Envy hurts my EarEven Fame it selfe can hardly reach me hereImpertinence with all her Tattling TrainFair-sounding Flatterys delicious BaneCensorious Folly Noisy Party RageThe Thousand with which she must engageWho dare have Virtue in a Vicious Age
