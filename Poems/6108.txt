
The giant Slinky
of  Spring approaches I have nothing
to sport after spending
a fortune on hooded
sweaters that make
me look like I’m searching
for the Holy Grail 
Struggling with
granola  soy milk
dental bills accumulate
like snow  the potatoes
I forgot have rotted 
I’m broke  broke broke  broke broke a bowling
ball spiraling down
a middle-aged
staircase of doubt 
The night I crazily
fled for the gentrified
grids of  14th Street 
A pinball I landed
in Playbill  I left
Brooklyn tossing
televisions  futons
like bombs
in the bowels
of  hipster bohemia 
In the piano karaoke
bar I met Kevin
a Peter Pan
Tennessee man
who spun quips  wit
like pixie dust about me 
A puckish chariot
fueled by moxie
this lean tambourine
of charms leaned
over me a hot flamingo
in the midnight light admitted his
once-upon-a-time
fetish for Laotian
men in his youth 
I wanted him to fall
for me as if  he stumbled
into the inside
of an Oriental
mansion shaking
the tchotchkes
in my heart steeping my
crush into sweet green tea 
Kevin would be my model
of elegance unabashed
confidence a dragon
fierceness  He said
There’s more to Rainbow
Pride than RuPaul Stonewall kickball I finally felt
I belonged in DC 
November Kevin’s
jaw ached  He showed
up at The Black Fox
mumbling  jumble
garble through tears 
His feature canceled 
After the first break
from winter gray to blue
Facebook alerts Kevin’s
wheeled to hospice
liver cancer 
I teach Donmike
how to make pancit
noodles  We become
the curse of gossiping
Filipina spinster aunts 
How have we become
giggling little lily pad
princesses behind
invisible hand
fans waiting for
our potential
suitors to make
the first move
I wonder whether
you’re afraid my hug
lingers a little too long
after I rub your feet
or maybe you’re just
a Scorpio expressing
affection  I know
I have 3rd world Daddy
issues but I don’t want
to bring up hopes fuck ups 
Maybe I’m in love
with you like that
baby weasel riding
the flying woodpecker’s
back  It’s an Avatar
magical sci-fi
unexpected flash
of  bliss when really
the woodpecker is
fighting for his life 
The weasel doesn’t
know what it’s gotten
itself into but a thrill
that will never
come again
something better
than a feathered
Baby Jane din-din 
Tomorrow you’ll
want to go to Rehoboth kite surf at the beach
house of the guy who
lusts after you  The priest’s
sermon makes no sense
Forest Fires in the Bay
Water Well Maidens “Let It Go” from Frozen 
It’s not that I hate white
people or that we’re soul mates 
It’s that you’re beginning
to wash off me like ashes
in holy water
