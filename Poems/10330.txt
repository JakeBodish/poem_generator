
Come with me then my son       Thine eyes are wide for truthAnd I will give thee memories       And thou shalt give me youth The lake laps in silver        The streamlet leaps her lengthAnd I will give thee wisdom       And thou shalt give me strength The mist is on the moorland       The rain roughs the reedAnd I will give thee patience       And thou shalt give me speed When lightnings lash the skyline       Then thou shalt learn thy partAnd when the heav’ns are direst       For thee to give me heart Forthrightness I will teach thee       The vision and the scopeTo hold the hand of honour        And thou shalt give me hopeAnd when the heav’ns are deepest       And stars most bright aboveMay God then teach thee duty       And thou shalt teach me love
