
I am tired of having five different names                      -
Having to change them when I enter
 
A new country or take on a new life  My
First name is my truest I suppose but I
 
Never use it and nobody calls me by this Vietnamese
Name though it is on my birth certificate 
 
Tue My Chuc  It makes the sound of a twang of a
String pulled  My parents tell me my name in Cantonese
 
is Chuc Mei Wai  Three soft bird chirps and they call
me Ah Wai  Shortly after I moved to the U S  I became
 
Teresa My Chuc then Teresa Mei Chuc  “Teresa” is the sound
Water makes when one is washing one’s hands  After my first
 
Marriage my name was Teresa Chuc Prokopiev 
After my second marriage my name was Teresa Chuc Dowell 
 
Now I am back to Teresa Mei Chuc but I want to go way back 
Reclaim that name once given and lost so quickly in its attempt
 
to become someone that would fit in  Who is Tue My Chuc
I don’t really know  I was never really her and her birthday
 
on March 16 I never celebrate because it’s not my real birthday
though it is on my birth certificate  My birthday is on January 26
 
really but I have to pretend that it’s on March 16
because my mother was late registering me after the war 
 
Or it’s in December the date changing every year according to
the lunar calendar this is the one my parents celebrate
 
because it’s my Chinese birthday  All these names
and birthdays make me dizzy  Sometimes I just don’t feel like a
 
Teresa anymore Tue pronounced Twe isn’t so embarrassing 
A fruit learns to love its juice  Anyways I’d like to be string   
 
resonating  Pulled back tensely like a bow
 
Then reverberate in the arrow’s release straight for the heart
