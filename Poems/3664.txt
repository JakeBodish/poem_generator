
nun meets me at the station    first month with carol and
dick reynolds   set the table   clean the kitchen   vacuum thank god she didnt ask me to take care of the children 
i dry  dishes in the afternoon    watch her can apples from
the backyard put them in the cellar dark to save for winter why is everything so quiet   why does the man come home
from school everyday at 330 and read the paper   why a
different casserole on the table every night and everyone
eats one portion and one portion only  why is there always
enough but never too much
