Hear the word of the Lordye children of Pittsburgh of Calistoga and Tlaquepaqueye hierophants and wishbonesteraphim and household plants for I am a jealous God betrayed My lover whom I upliftedhas fallen to other affections Weep for her outcast statefor I rescind her corn and her fields her appetites and her husbands her loom and the cloth of her weaving yea as she sleeps in her bedI will crumble her idols of clay I will cause to burn in the nighther barns filled with swallowsher caves of rodents and bats her racks of sidereal dresses her stacks of serpentine hats The velvet of her touch once royal I will scarify with my wrath for I am a god betrayed my lovehas reached into my weaknessand turned my heart like a fist  Therefore I will strip her nakedand drive her into the field In her body of filth and feathersher blood of beasts and men she ismy desolation and a forgotten name For my cosmos is contracted  My first world slips from my hands Tell the people my prophet Hosea that I loved her more than loveand she gave not love in return My anger flattens and spreadsalong the walls and windows It glances from my mirrorsand breaks the east wind’s bones I was a God of such strengththey could not guess my name And this woman of human warmthsuckled me like a child Now I dwell with the mole blindlyand my voice is thin as a gnat’s I grieve what grinds in me heavily I am but a half note half sung
