
Amidst the days of pleasant mirthThat throw their halo round our earthAmidst the tender thoughts that riseTo call bright tears to happy eyesAmidst the silken words that moveTo syllable the names we loveThere glides no day of gentle blissMore soothing to the heart than thisNo thoughts of fondness eer appearMore fond than those I write of hereNo name can eer on tablet shineMy father more beloved than thineTis sweet adown the shady pastA lingering look of love to cast Back th enchanted world to callThat beamed around us first of allAnd walk with Memory fondly oerThe paths where Hope had been before Sweet to receive the sylphic soundThat breathes in tenderness aroundRepeating to the listening earThe names that made our childhood dear For parted Joy like Echo kindWill leave her dulcet voice behindTo tell amidst the magic airHow oft she smiled and lingered there
