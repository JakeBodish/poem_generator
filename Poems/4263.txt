
I am afraid of your transcendental death 
When people say think of a man  I think of a brown man 
Sometimes the earth grows khella because she can feel our suffering 
Yooooooing beneath Costco tikis 
When people say think of a man  I think of a white man 
I am meant to hold you in your oblique pain your map-driven pain 
Yooooooing beneath Costco tikis 
I was drunk holding my teeth in like students 
I am meant to hold you in your oblique pain your map-driven pain 
You die like an actor 
I was drunk holding my teeth in like students 
My body was a brown dog I shoved back into the water 
You die like an actor 
I beseeched but couldn’t stay out of the first person 
My body was a brown dog I shoved back into the water 
Hold me hold me hold me holdmeholdmeholdme 
I beseeched but couldn’t stay out of the first person 
Where does it hurt we say 
Hold me hold me hold me holdmeholdmeholdme 
I am afraid of your transcendental death
