This day is called the feast of CrispianHe that outlives this day and comes safe homeWill stand a tip-toe when the day is namedAnd rouse him at the name of Crispian He that shall live this day and see old ageWill yearly on the vigil feast his neighboursAnd say ‘To-morrow is Saint Crispian’Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars And say ‘These wounds I had on Crispin’s day ’Old men forget yet all shall be forgotBut he’ll remember with advantagesWhat feats he did that day then shall our names Familiar in his mouth as household wordsHarry the king Bedford and ExeterWarwick and Talbot Salisbury and GloucesterBe in their flowing cups freshly remember’d This story shall the good man teach his sonAnd Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go byFrom this day to the ending of the worldBut we in it shall be remember’dWe few we happy few we band of brothersFor he to-day that sheds his blood with meShall be my brother be he ne’er so vileThis day shall gentle his conditionAnd gentlemen in England now a-bedShall think themselves accursed they were not hereAnd hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaksThat fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day
