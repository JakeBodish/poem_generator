
English Composition at South Middlesex Correctional Center 
Julie reads out loud and I praise her super thesis then show
how her paragraphs veer away from it just summarize 
And is she pissed Too pissed to listen when her classmates try
to help  Amanda offers Act 2 Scene 1 Now I do love her
too as evidence of Iagos state of mind  But Julies
shutting down frowning at her handwritten draft writing
that took her weeks  Hey Julie I say  Julie doesnt look up 
Says What  Says I hate this stupid paper now  So I sayHey Julie  Amandas helping you write downwhat shes saying  She says Im aggravated  I think
they take classes on naming their feelings  I say I know itbut you need to pull it together or youll end up screwingyourself  This is your chance  Were all quiet breathing
together willing her to break out of this  Then
a little miracle  I look around the room and see
that everyone is beautiful  Each did something special
with her hair  Hey I say again  I say hey a lot in prison Hey wait a minute  Whats up with everybodys hair
Mabel got a haircut  Ellies hair is long and black and gleaming
down her back Amandas in French braids  Julies freshly
blonde down to the roots  You guys all look great
They laugh  Theyre happy I noticed 
Thank god I noticed now for a minute we
are women in a room talking about their hair  Julie says
Amanda did her highlights and Sandy blew it out  Good job guysshe looks great  And then I say Julie  Look at youall pissed off over your paper when youre so luckyLook at all these good friends you have  Helpingwith your paper doing your hair       She nods 
She looks me in the eye back with us back on track I know she says  I need to work on my gratitude
