
In the rearview fog extinguishes the hills of new
money mansions on acres away from road or sight 
Their architected privacy windows to look out at
a land that wont look back  The fogs secure drapery 
Its space to dance through they buy and what one
might call dappled light moving across their acres light
through their oaks moving over their mares brushed to a sheen •
Palms of sugar cubes  Soft snorting I bet  Here Muybridge
proved their horses fly a moment  In their homes they cant
hear each other call from foyer to pool house  I am
jealous of this loneliness most of all loneliness
delimited by colonnade and cold pressed juices They make excellent corpses among the expensive flowers     I imagine hills and hills dappled like this
