
When I first heard you on the phone
your voice had to be that 40s wartime voice
for it to get under my skin like it did
after seven years asleep 
 You’re at the beginning of something you saidand I’m at the end of something
but you didn’t go away
twice-born three times coming around
rough cello 
 
                                   Late days
I want to drive to your grave
But I don’t belong to it
