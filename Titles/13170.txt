
In the cold I will rise I will batheIn waters of ice myselfWill shiver and shrive myselfAlone in the dawn and anointForehead and feet and handsI will shutter the windows from lightI will place in their sockets the fourTall candles and set them a-flameIn the grey of the dawn and myselfWill lay myself straight in my bedAnd draw the sheet under my chin
