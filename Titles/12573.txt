
I wander thro each charterd street
Near where the charterd Thames does flow  
And mark in every face I meet
Marks of weakness marks of woe 
In every cry of every Man
In every Infants cry of fear
In every voice in every ban
The mind-forgd manacles I hear 
How the Chimney-sweepers cry
Every blackning Church appalls 
And the hapless Soldiers sigh
Runs in blood down Palace walls 
But most thro midnight streets I hear
How the youthful Harlots curse
Blasts the new-born Infants tear 
And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse
