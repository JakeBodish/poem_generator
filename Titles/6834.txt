
The fascination of whats difficult
Has dried the sap out of my veins and rent
Spontaneous joy and natural content
Out of my heart  Theres something ails our colt
That must as if it had not holy blood
Nor on Olympus leaped from cloud to cloud
Shiver under the lash strain sweat and jolt
As though it dragged road metal  My curse on plays
That have to be set up in fifty ways
On the days war with every knave and dolt
Theatre business management of men 
I swear before the dawn comes round again
Ill find the stable and pull out the bolt
