I wanted to write an epic about suffering
but when I found a tendril
of her hair among the ruins
of her mud house
I found my epic there 2
I didn’t sleep last night 
As if the night
were hiding in the morning coffee 3
Her life is a game of snakes and ladders
sent relentlessly back to square one
but whose life isn’t She takes a breath
and throws the dice again 4
The city glitters below
the airplane window not because
of the bones and skulls scattered
under the sun but the view
through the frosted breather hole 5
She died and time changed
for those she loved most
but her watch kept ticking 6
A god carried the burdens
until the weight persuaded him
to transfer them to man   
the new suffering god 7
The map of Iraq looks like a mitten
and so does the map of Michigan   
a match I made by chance 8
If you can’t save people
at least don’t hate them 9
Her bubbling annoys me   
can’t understand a word she says 
So what if I toss her from the aquarium
So what if I spill her new world
with this nasty immigrant fish10
The city’s innumerable lights
turning on and off remind us
we are born to arrive
as we are born to leave 11
The handkerchiefs are theirs
but the tears are ours 12
Women running barefoot 
Behind them stars falling from the sky 13
So strange
in my dream of us
you were also a dream 14
He said to me You are in my eyes 
Now when he sleeps
his eyelids cover me 15
Gilgamesh stopped wishing
for immortality
for only in death could he be certain
of seeing his friend Enkidu again 16
Some say love means
putting all your eggs
in one basket 
If they all break
can the basket remain intact17
The homeless are not afraid
to miss something 
What passes through their eyes
is how the clouds pass over the rushing cars
the way pigeons miss some of the seeds
on the road and move away 
Yet only they know
what it means to have a home
and to return to it 18
The wind and rain
don’t discriminate
in buffeting us 
We are equal
in the eyes of the storm 19
When I was broken into fragments
you puzzled me
back together
piece by piece 
I no longer fear
being broken
in any moment 20
Freezing in the mountains
without blankets or food
and all they heard wasno news is good news 21
Their stories didn’t kill me
but I would die if I didn’t
tell them to you 22
Before killing them
they collected their personal effects 
Their cell phones are all ringing
in the box 23
We are not upset when
the grass dies  We know
it will come back
in a season or two 
The dead don’t come back
but they appear every time
in the greenness of the grass 24
If yearning encircles us
what does it portend
That a circle has no beginning
and no end
