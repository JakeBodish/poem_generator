
The barstools capacious then ever more enclosed
with every beer as evening erodes 
A few capricious tourists off the cozy track
propose unbeaten toasts  Hell soon be going back 
Mannequin musicians play mandolins or thumb pianos
bleat out a reggae air on ragged banjos 
The booths patter with the local lingo 
Smattered English polishes the windows 
An amble to the john the mirrors random crack 
The urinals askew  Hell soon be going back 
The minimal solicitudes of seven-minute flirts
blurted-out soliloquies well-trained parting words 
Insert pejorative for natives here
before a sputtered call for one more beer 
Dusty carnations carnival bric-a-brac 
long-faded revaltions  Hell soon be going back
