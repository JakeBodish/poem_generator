
Theres no cause for vanity and none for
pride its just a matter of assembling
words in lines then dividing them up or
letting them divide themselves hoping
they sound good or bad  Whats important
is that they sound like something  Its all
a question of staying alert so that red doesnt
bleed into orange or orange into yellow or
yellow into silence  Theres no cause for
rejecting silence and none for accepting it
either  We should speak when theres noth-
ing to say and be quiet when others talk 
Thats the poets business so get used to it 
Theres nothing glorious about it  The future
doesnt count for anything and the past just
laughs at us  Theres no cause for writing
this poem and none for deleting it either
