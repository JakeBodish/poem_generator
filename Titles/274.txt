if not a taut swaddle
loosening body
if not a warm swaddle
cooling blood
if not thread
in a swaddle
made of body horizons
if not lines
where sky swaddles
Earth  See father Stars if not swaddled
matter emitting light  See spirit Wind if it does not trace
paths around bodies  See blood Universe if not outermost
concentric circle  See mother 
A kiss if not mouths pressed
into wet twists taste
if not flavor swaddling

if not the option
to swaddle spirit
if not the smallest unit
of the swaddled mother
if not hips
