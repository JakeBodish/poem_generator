
My father does his own dental work 
A power drill and epoxy
and steady hands 
 
On Christmas Day he mistook
the Macy’s star
for the Viet Cong flag 
 
While watchingForrest Gump he told me
how he too carried a friend 
 He squeezedaround my throat so tightI thought I’d die with him
