
We keep trying to kill it split it hackIt to itsy bits  We suspend itOn the wall where we can see itPassing  We hang it around our necksOr wrists laying pulse next toPulse as if each might like Company  Ba-bump etc  Rising And setting has everything to doWith it  In the afternoon we feel soLazy we try not to close our eyesAnd jerk awake wondering what hasPassed and where did we goFor that suspended hourAnd could anything keep us here
