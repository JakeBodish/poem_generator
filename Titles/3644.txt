
Just let the San Andreas
stay put keeping this tunnel
intact enough to amble
 
out of it past Louie’s DimSum a Saturday afternoon
a breeze detectable off
 
the bay visible in the distance
carrying with it the smells
of open air markets
 
crab freshly caught
and seahorses piled
in bins along Stockton       
 
or Jack strolling out of the tube
connecting Polk Gulch
and North Beach on his way
 
to Aquatic Park to spread
the Sporting Green
on his favorite patch of grass      
 
He is ferrying the portable
radio to his ear
listening for the count
 
in the bottom of the ninth
at Candlestick
begins to smooth
 
the pages with the palms
before he sits
to keep it dry the split
 
seat of his pants                  for Jack Spicer 1925-1965
