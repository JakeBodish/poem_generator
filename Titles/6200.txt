An Ireland as of chalk the sky
standing in for the sea the beach
a reach of blue the vineyards’
green scooped out in cirque
in cove a subtlety of air laps
the eyes abob like barques
come from afar and the viator
standing there poised to dis-
embark the undercurrent of air
escaping him tossed to  fro
gaze wrenched from its angle
of purchase upon the world
capsized head now careened
against the suddenness
of rock eyes whiplashed into new
prospects he drowns in fire
enflamed fine silk aquiver
at the singe of brazier he
burns would Hell be as blue
or the sun the obverse of God

Now at Laon the Lugdunum
of the North deposited on this citadel
of chalk white arx former
temple of Lug the light-
god of the Gauls  he
this Celt from Hibernia setting
foot on this podium this puy
this platform afloat
at cloud  wind height
blown in from the septentrion
breathes in the quintessence
of rains alevel the briar’s
pinks zone where water
at first cold snap turns to snow 
Fallen from fire  Autumn’s pure light
whitens the mount the tufa
reverberating the radiance
of a Cyclades isle here mis-
placed high above these plains
by some error in translation

At Lindisfarne let us suppose  
even if Alcuin’s letters to the island’s
monks exhorting them to combat
the Viking may be evidence
to the contrary   that he studied
Greek that Charles the Bald
offshoot of the Pippinids
summoned him here to Laon
to translate Dionysus  Between
the king’s vineyards  the blue sky
a whisper of the North Sea
in the channel of Île Sainte when
the seals bark at ebb tide
Johannes the Hibernian cocks an ear
despite finding his coracle of Latin
too frail a craft to explore the peninsulas
of Greek  carries with him
the long-lapping waves of Scotland
 seaweed’s tang where kingfisher
nests beside nugget of amber

That which lies out of reach taking
the shape of this white  shadowy
rock on which he is now beached
 whose slope he now climbs blind
beneath the sun fallen from the same height
he ascends would Satan be extending him
his welcome with the same dark
radiance of stone between his eyes
 the same fine peppering of pinks
that spice his senses on either side
of the stairs against this what whiteness
what candor The sky’s rarified air
there to calculate the distances between
the things he climbs or descends
the divisions of the world now
extended now illuminated between the lines
the borders of the intangible now flaring up
with darkness the granular opacities
now brightening the sun biting into
the margins of the real the image dying

Denys foundation of all cathedrals
to come mentor of naves stained glass
rosettes of all the gossamer shadow
spiderwebbing the light from the East
as it rises Lord of Ionia oriental
Ionas Denys Dionysos
your Greek sailing the great hill
of Lugdunum your darkness raining down
its alphas its Alphei the dawn
uncorking the fizz of its dations 
John Scotus comments his violet ink
relighting igniting the world according
to Plato filtering the grit of the flower
through the sieve of the eye
the bran the curds of light
sifting out the clots of theology
in this shadowy cave the locals
burning every log in sight hoc lignum
a bonfire of stones
held in common lapis iste
