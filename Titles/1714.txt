
A Poet am I neither born nor bredBut to a witty poet marriedWhose brain is fresh and pleasant as the SpringWhere Fancies grow and where the Muses sing  There oft I lean my head and listening harkTo catch his words and all his fancies markAnd from that garden show of beauties takeWhereof a posy I in verse may make  Thus I that have no gardens of my ownThere gather flowers that are newly blown
