On the day the sienna-skinned man
held my shoulders between his spade-shaped hands
easing me down into the azure water of Jordan
I woke ninety-three million miles from myself
Lev Davidovich Bronstein
shoulder-deep in the Volga
while the cheap dye of my black silk shirt darkened the water 
My head wet water caught in my lashes    
Am I blind
I rub my eyes then wade back to shore   
undress and lie down
until Stalin comes from his place beneath the birch tree 
He folds my clothes
and I button myself in my marmot coat
and together we start the long walk back to Moscow 
He doesn’t ask what did you see in the river
but I hear the hosts of a man drowning in water and holiness   
the castrati voices I can’t recognize
skating on knives from trees from air
on the thin ice of my last night in Russia    
Leon Trotsky  Bread 
I want to scream but silence holds my tongue   
with small spade-shaped hands
and only this comes so quietly
Stalin has to press his ear to my mouth   I have only myself  Put me on the train    
I won’t look back
