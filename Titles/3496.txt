If I had a ginko tree
Id climb it in the evening 
If I had a marmoset
Hed climb the tree with me 
If we saw a falling star
Id wish I had a rocket 
If I had a rocket
Id drag the star back home 
If I went to space
Id pick up a satellite 
If I had my own moon
I wouldnt be so sad 
If I werent so sad
I wouldnt need a companion 
If I sold my marmoset
Id have a lot of cash 
If I had some money
Id buy an Eldorado 
Silver 1959
With fins like raptor wings 
Id shine that Eldorado
and drive it to my fathers 
If I had a father
Id take him for a ride
