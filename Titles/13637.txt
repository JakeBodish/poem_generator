One angel got it all wrong 
She plopped into this
sad century feet first
in her dark clothes 
There wasnt much water
that winter just a few
puddles really 
to break her fall 
Mud-splattered she rose
and shook like a canine 
It didnt take long
to see her soaked wings
as a backdrop to all
the nonmagic to which we were
accustomed or to see
what passed for history
as a forgetting of sorts 
Was that one or two wars
Strange how as she limped
down a dim vicolo
some willful disc hovered
above her more florid
than a sky how the putrid
puddles with their last
reflections could neither
correct nor register that light
