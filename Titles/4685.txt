others’ cheekbones  Infinity scarves vanilla coffee mint tea warm whatever 
Cozy becoming the coming-at-the-seams a coupletof verbs mid-bodily inexperience 
That man doing cartwheels is not wearing a shirt
 in any other life I’d want to be the double darefanfaring a future so totally astonishedby his nipples  This is what I mean
when I say things like catastrophe Okay fine  Just one more winter 
Nothing can compare anymore to us anymore 
You big good oak limb  I’m in such cute like w you today In one diary of my have-beens my mother
named me Elizabeth after one of her
mothers  You god particle  You matrilineage I’ve never lived anywhere more
or less this haunted  She named my sister
Elizabeth  You boygenius  You midsummer pinky promise ring 
There’s this person I know I’m not in love w but wears
a dress patterned like a postcard from the state my grandmadied in  Imagine waking up
a whole frame away from your bedsheets  Imaginewaking up  being anything as yellow
as a dress  You treeline  You root song  What’s an amountof time equal
to you You kindling ring finger  You unchewable bark
but the headache’s gone  Pardon me dandelionshave you seen my ghost six foot nothing
has an interstate for a mother but also a mother Adjustyour spurs honeybunch  This time I’m writing all of us
in pink ink  Let’s huckle-buckle off into the leafiestof all possible genderings  You know how the rain
starts right after you get home  the country songyour friend slow-danced w her big love to the one
your mom would play real quiet on her moonbeamhighway streak back to Pensacola is somehow
already at the chorus  you forget there are words like joyOr when someone whispers Imagine you never met them
back at the bum grinning stars You remember It’s like that 
Or is that  The difference between salt  salt  A somedayof matching sweaters 
Told you it’s cute  O sweaters  O little knitbundles of vegetable-spit  It’s always sunsetting 
You golden hour  You soap-soft seasonal Once my mom found me
sitting in a circle of candles touching each rosebud sat w me until we were wax musuemsof our secrets  Look 
the sky’s a toenail  the moon’s a chesthair  All the shirtlessboys have tired themself out spread-eagled
 slapping the sun off their shoulder blades  My body is a lineheading for my body  You crushed-grass
sex smell  You dirt-inverted comma  Someone w bleachedhair is biking home to restud their denim 
I rediscovered kissing foreheads  it is so yes again 
Hurry up  sunspot dayliliesThe cops aren’t going to awe themselvesto death  we have
a dictionary to laugh across The light’s seltzer bubbles I said My lord  I thoughtMy god  O moonstruck  O gladracket  Barringgravity our knees could be forevering each other 
Barring leather love is a world I’m prayingall my mothers’ joy back toward 
Elizabeth was my name  I’m writing this on all the trees like a wish I’m kissing every hem in sight 
We’re all hysterical  going nowhere together C’mon rapture  Let’s go bedazzling 
Nothing gets futured without its own spitshine
 I’m already not not not not not not miraculous
