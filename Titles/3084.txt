
And now I have another lad
    No longer need you tell
How all my nights are slow and sad
    For loving you too well 
His ways are not your wicked ways
    Hes not the like of you 
He treads his path of reckoned days
    A sober man and true 
Theyll never see him in the town
    Another on his knee 
Hed cut his laden orchards down
   If that would pleasure me 
Hed give his blood to paint my lips
    If I should wish them red 
He prays to touch my finger-tips
   Or stroke my prideful head 
He never weaves a glinting lie
    Or brags the hearts hell keep 
I have forgotten how to sigh 
    Remembered how to sleep 
Hes none to kiss away my mind 
    A slower way is his 
Oh Lord On reading this I find
    A silly lot he is
