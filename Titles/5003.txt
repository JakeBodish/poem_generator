
In memory of Anthony Kerrigan
The pure shapes of things shake and are fall
ing under the cry of bajo el cri cri
and chirping of the six margaritas
daisies that I loved but now know deflower
when the men bent upon murdering me bend
down in cabinets and on cliffs and in cafes
where some flamenco guitarist breaks his fingers
on the grave accents              breaks
his fingers on the acute
              
                          hunting now
even in the graves
