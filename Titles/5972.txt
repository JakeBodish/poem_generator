
In the energy crisis my city has turned to burning angel skins  I read by their light a book of elegies  A fruit fly lands on Amichai I slap him flat Against the page  Now it is an elegy for him as well And his tomb  And I am a terrible toothless godStringing blades of grass between the tongues of sheep Ash of angel fire drifts over my head falls in my coffee  O Holy Holy Holy indigestion I bribe the coming day with open windowsAnd freshly washed underwearHung out on the clotheslineSlipping hastily over the hips of winds The winds know all you have to do isOpen your mouth the flies will come
