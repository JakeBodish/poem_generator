The gym opened out before us like a vast arena the bleached floorboardsyawned toward a vanishing point staggered seats highas the Mayan temple I once saw devoured by vines Each of us was eaten up inside   all citizens of   lost             and unmapped cities Frank hugged the pimply ballover his belly like an unborn child  Clairedressed for daycare in daffodil yellow and jelly shoes David’s gaze was an emperor’s surveying a desiccatedbattlefield  Since he viewed everything that way we all            saw him the same The psych techs in Cloroxed whitewere giant angels who set us running drills at whichwe sucked  The zones we set out to defend were wateryat every edge  We missed close chest passes easy combos  Our metronomes run different tempos             John proclaimed  Then Claire started seeing dashes stutter through the air behind the ball Then speed lines on our backs and then her own head went wobbly as a spinning egg  She’d once trackedplanetary orbits for NASA and now sat sidelined            by her eyes’ projections  Only Bill had game Catatonic Bill whose normal talent was to schlubdays in a tub chair   his pudding face scarredwith chicken pox   using his hand for an ashtraybelly for an armrest  Now all that peeled away and he             emerged clean as an egg  He was a litheand licorice boy eeling past all comers each shotsheer net  He faked both ways went left  Beneath the orange rim his midair pirouettes defied the gravity that Icould barely sludge through  He scored beyond what even             Claire could countthen he bent pantinghands on knees as the orderlies held out water cupsand the rest of us reached to pat his back or slaphis sweaty hand no one minding about the stench or his breath like old pennies  Then as quick as that             he went Inside his headsome inner winch did reel him back from the frontof   his face bones where he’d been ablaze  He went back and back into that shadowed stare  Lucky we were to breathehis air  Breath is God’s intent to keep us living  He was             the self   I’d come inwanting to kill and I left him there
