
Two women on the lone wet strand   The winds out with a will to roamThe waves wage war on rocks and sand    And a ship is long due home The sea sprays in the womens eyes    Hearts can writhe like the seas wild foamLower descend the tempestuous skies   For the winds out with a will to roam O daughter thine eyes be better than mine   The waves ascend high as yonder domeNorth or south is there never a sign   And a ship is long due home They watched there all the long night through    The winds out with a will to roamWind and rain and sorrow for two    And heaven on the long reach home
