
The soldiers are afraid
of the camera  Are you shooting the souk
The photographer says No no just her 
I say Just me just me 
My black dress a little above the knee helps 
A girl learns to spectacle enough 
The soldier nods lowers his head 
The crew remind me to sayNot from here to say Half-half
to speak English mostly Everyone is always kinder to strangers 
The city will devour its children
unless she doesn’t recognize them 
And so I of this city
I who stand on stages and name this city
deny this city in the heart of the city
deny this city at the old gate of the city 
I say Bonjour I say Thank you I undo
my accent and put on the colonizer’s tongue 
When you say hometown what do you mean
The crew comment on the quality
of the light through the tin roofs
they say Pretend no one is looking 
But the guy with the espresso and cigarette is looking
and the teenager who sells batteries is looking
and the man with the shisha is looking and the woman
in the clothes shop his wife perhaps is looking 
The photographer says Beautiful says Try
to keep your shoulders even
