
nodding tho the lamps lit low
nodding for passers underground
to and fro shes darning and
the yarn is weeping red and pale
marking the train stops from algiers
sleeping tho the eyes are pale
hums in rhythum wa bonnet on
lullaby a broken song
the sifting-cloth is bleeding red
weeping yarn from algiers
lullaby tho babys gone
the cradle rocks a barren song
shes rocking wher ribbons on
shes rocking yarn and needles oh
its long coming from algiers
