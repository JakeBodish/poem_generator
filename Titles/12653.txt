
Give me more love or more disdain
     The torrid or the frozen zoneBring equal ease unto my pain
     The temperate affords me noneEither extreme of love or hateIs sweeter than a calm estate Give me a storm if it be love
     Like Danae in that golden showrI swim in pleasure if it prove
     Disdain that torrent will devourMy vulture-hopes and hes possessdOf heaven thats but from hell releasd Then crown my joys or cure my painGive me more love or more disdain
