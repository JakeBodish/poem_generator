
The monsters that come at night dont
breathe fire have two heads or long claws 
The monsters that come at night dont
come bloody and half-dead and calling your name 
They come looking like regular boys
going through your drawers and pockets sayingYou better not tell Counselor else Ill beat you down 
The monsters that come at night snatch
the covers off your bed take your
pillow and in the morning
steal your bacon when the cooks back is turned
call themselves The Throwaway Boys sayYou one of us now 
When the relatives stop coming
When you dont know where your sister is anymore
When every sign around you says
Group Home Rules Dont
do this and dont do that
until it sinks in one rainy Saturday afternoon
while youre sitting at the Group Home window
reading a beat-up Group Home book
wearing a Group Home hand-me-down shirt
hearing all the Group Home loudness that
you are a Throwaway Boy 
And the news just sits in your stomach
hard and heavy as Group Home food
