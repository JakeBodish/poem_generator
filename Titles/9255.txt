
They pass before me one by one riding on animals
What are you waiting for they want to know
Z  young as he is  mad into the bargain tells me
Some day youll drop everything  become a rishi you know 
I know
The forest is there Ive lived in it
    More certainly than this town Irrelevant 
    What am I waiting for
A change in customs that will take 1000 years to come about
Whos to make the change but me
    Returning again and again Amida says
Whys that dream so necessary walking out of whatever house alone
Nothing but the clothes on my back money or no
Down the road to the next place the highway leading to the   
mountains
From which I absolutely must come back
What business have I to do that
I know the world and I love it too much and it
Is not the one Id find outside this door
