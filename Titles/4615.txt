Nation of Domination
my mom hugs me  wants me to stay  i have my foot
on the pedal  a fake gold chain on my neck  i confess
i’m a sucker  i never want magicians to reveal their secrets 
i want to live in the unknowing where everything is possible 
my mom dances with me to Los Bukis  she thinks this makes
me her baby still  perspective is a magic trick  i hit my brother
with the Rock Bottom  i bet you can guess what i leave out 
ask Farooq if you need a hint  the brain is full of magic
i don’t understand  no one signs up to take a dive  in wrestling
there’s a team of writers who decide who wins and who loses 
the metaphor is obvious  my mom wasn’t born to play the role
of mom i don’t care how many baby dolls she played with 
i dance with my mom to Los Bukis  you’re a fool
if you believe it’s her son she’s trying to hold on to

moonshine
the poets are right about the moonlight 
i take my spot of sky  deposit it
into a savings account  only after
the bank confiscated our house
did i understand  roses
don’t grow without pricked hands 
i didn’t have to spend a summer in a freezer
packing lunch meat to know the value
of sunlight  my mom didn’t have
to spend a decade wiping down floors to appreciate
education  when i give you a bouquet of roses
i give you a bouquet of bloody hands 
a handful of dirt  the worms that doted on your roses 
when i take my piece of sky out of the bank
it’s smaller  the drunks are right about moonshine

Shelter Island
frigid are the branches of black trees cutting through
a blacker night  missing are the lampposts that adorn
every few feet of New York  cold is your hand in my hand
 yes i am a man  you are a woman  my wilderness
is not unlike the woods that surround us  the sky in my wild
lit by lanterns in the faces of animals  my own flammable face 
my father’s temperament  my thrifted excuse  yes
it’s the night before 45 is sworn in as president
 yes we leave the city  we would leave the planet too 
you hold my hand  we walk into the teeth of the hour
armed with each other  bitter cold is the world we leave behind 
when we hold hands we invent a spaceship
