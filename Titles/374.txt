
I found my father’s favorite Swiss army knife
in a box he sent me with no note
just James Bond videos
nothing else 
What was the message
 
The message was there wasn’t one 
 
This world violent full of sex
the movie’s zeitgeist era after era a new Bond
double-o-seven-ing in 
 
Divorced dad Sundays
at The Greenwich watching
the British Secret Service save the world 
 
I thought he sent the knife inadvertently
but now I see it was code 
 
he was boxed in
without a knife
to cut himself out
