May we blossom every fifty yearswithout afflicting the people May our seedpods nourish rodentswho roam our groveswithout rebuking lands with famine May sweet potatoes and rice save us May ginger and turmeric flourishto the bitter distaste of ratswhile tresses of bamboo flowers changeling white waspsload the groves with seedin rare perennial synchrony   May our sisters flower en massehundreds of square miles apart   in the pale night  May our shoots  pray a silent vision of healing  our rhizome-laden memoriesYes we share our hungeronly once on this earth my love Let us bless our fruit and multiply
