and she knew hed fallen and she knew before she turned
hed be crawling like a crawdad rock to loam 
because she tried to love the straight back and neck
hed erected to recollect the man hed been
before because she found herself adding up his usefulness
like some kind of auctioneer she showed him
the dark coils areoling both her breasts and all the ways
she bent and lifted bent and lifted steady strong 
She let him believe he was past due for a harvest
and her hands were the right ones now to hold onto the scythe

She made quick work of pleasure  The boysmile bunked down
in his eyes she claimed  Her tongue found the place in his mouth
where the teeth were gone where hed hold his corncakes
until they grew soft enough to chew  History had bedded him
in all of this his own history and failures not his own 
Before hed tramped in shed watched another man a man shed thought
shed hated watched his body opened opened opened until
blood had married brine  Shed watch that man be whipped into something
good for nothing more than fertilizing clay and shed thought
buckshot would have been a brand of kindness if sprayed into him
just then  But even after his hard going she did not miss him very much 
                                                        •
Anyone she chose could be shucked like surplus property tomorrow
but that hadnt been enough to warn her off of picking him that night 
Because she knew if she set her sight on nothing shed get nothing
in return shed walked with him  But because the night progressed so
 because there were some clouds no stars no moon hed tripped
over the branch of a dead and down tree  In all that darkness
there without a moon even then she had not fallen  She thought
to say so but she did not say so  She did nothing
but say she was sorry for him  She did not use her mouth
to say this  Could he not listen to her hands They spoke softly
articulating her condolences to his torn and bleeding skin
