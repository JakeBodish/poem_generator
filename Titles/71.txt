
Many months have passed
since the diagnosis
and you’re still grieving for her 
She’s not dead yet 
But she’s lost like a child is lost 
her mind the ocean floor
where she kicks up sand
and churns in the water 
 
Al we call it or AD 
never by its real name
as if mentioning the word would bring bad luck 
the need to cross one’s self across the heart
throw back to the ocean half of one’s catch
turn three times and pray to the East 
 
Papa’s and her letters
written during their courtship
are tied with a faded red ribbon
and sunk in a safe deposit box at Bishop Trust 
Long ago she gave them to you
for safekeeping  At the time
 
she exacted a promise from you
that you would not read them
until she was dead 
We twist down the spiral staircase
curled like a strand of seaweed
into the cold room of vaults
the heavy thud of door distinct as your sadness
following us everywhere  There
you turn over the bundle of letters
in your hand like unbelievable money 
“I’m so tempted to read them” you say 
 
You want her back
the feisty and independent one
the one who could at eighty
do ten knee bends in aerobics class
dance a smooth jitterbug
and shuttle like the tide
to and from the house about her business 
Not this Elizabeth you mourn
the one who can no longer reason
who points and giggles at fat people
and smells sometimes like the ocean 
Time slides like Dali’s clock 
Elizabeth is surprised
that she once was married and had a husband
that she once gave birth to sons
