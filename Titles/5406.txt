I Gray sky gray sea   gray mind the man thinks  He thinksTo grow old with it and kicks a stone into the water He mucks at the seam and it crumbles below him A sea gull beaks a crab flights vertically and dropsit to the rocks  The man cracks with laughtertossing a stone to a stone II Working alone means the voice must grow louderfor who can stand to think quietly all through the day’s calculationsI cannot  I let the voice grow loud  I let the voicehum outside my body in distinguishable phrasings and countthe increments as I set the fence according to the blade  All dayI stand before a blade and push things into its path I stand aside as what is removed is whisked alongside me The smallest particles of   what is removed thicken the airmaking a dream inside which one cannot live  All daythe voice is learning how to be outside of   the body III A man is not a beach nor is he stone though he collects their entiretyin a single thought  He works alone and his thoughts begin tosmack of stone  His teeth clatter with their collection IV A man can hold a secret between his teethand it will never leave his mouth for who would listento his wavering tune of so sad and how hard and hearanything original He is that he is   the errand and the foolrunning to himself over and over only to find that even heis tired of telling about it  To grow old with itwas the task and the question always would he lastA man can believe in the body and have no oneas though he were ghostor stone nothing to speak at or be heard from V All work no pay makes a body bray Though he may bray  Though he may bray and brayforgive him the bit  If he tells you his secrethe will have no secret This is how one sings a sentence into stone
