in the green season in the sudden season
the white the budded
                                             and the lost 
Water celebrates yielding continually
sheeted and fast in its overfall
slips down the rock evades the pillars
building its colonnades repairs
in stream and standing wave
retains its seaward green
broken by obstacle rock falling the water sheet
spouts and the mind dances excess of white 
White brilliant function of the land’s disease 
 
Many-spanned lighted the crest leans under
concrete arches and the channeled hills
turns in the gorge toward its release
kinetic and controlled the sluice
urging the hollow the thunder
the major climax
                                   energy
total and open watercourse
praising the spillway fiery glaze
crackle of light cleanest velocity
flooding the moulded force 
 
                    I open out a way over the water
                    I form a path between the Combatants                    Grant that I sail down like a living bird                    power over the fields and Pool of Fire                     Phoenix I sail over the phoenix world 
 
Diverted water the fern and fuming white
ascend in mist of continuous diffusion 
Rivers are turning inside their mountains
streams line the stone rest at the overflow
lake and in lanes of pliant color lie 
Blessing of this innumerable silver
printed in silver images of stone
walk on a screen of falling water
in film-silver in continual change
recurring colored plunging with the wave 
 
Constellations of light abundance of many rivers 
The sheeted island-cities the white surf filling west
the hope fast water spilled where still pools fed 
Great power flying deep between the rock and the sunset
the caretaker’s house and the steep abutment
hypnotic water fallen and the tunnels under
the moist and fragile galleries of stone
mile-long under the wave  Whether snow fall
the quick light fall years of white cities fall
flood that this valley built falls slipping down
the green turn in the river’s green 
Steep gorge the wedge of crystal in the sky 
 
     How many feet of whirlpools
     What is a year in terms of falling water
     Cylinders kilowatts capacities 
     Continuity Σ Q  0
     Equations for falling water  The streaming motion 
     The balance-sheet of energy that flows
     passing along its infinite barrier 
 
     It breaks the hills cracking the riches wide
     runs through electric wires
     it comes warning the night
     running among these rigid hills
     a single force to waken our eyes 
 
     They poured the concrete and the columns stood
     laid bare the bedrock set the cells of steel
     a dam for monument was what they hammered home 
     Blasted and stocks went up
     insured the base
     and limousines
     wrote their own graphs upon
     roadbed and lifeline 
 
Their hands touched mastery
wait for defense solid across the world 
Mr  Griswold  “A corporation is a body without a soul ”
Mr  Dunn  When they were caught at it they resorted to the
     methods employed by gunmen ordinary machine gun racke-
     teers  They cowardly tried to buy out the people who had the
     information on them 
Mr  Marcantonio  I agree that a racket has been practised but the
     most damnable racketeering that I have ever known is the
     paying of a fee to the very attorney who represented these
     victims  That is the most outrageous racket that has ever come
     within my knowledge 
Miss Allen  Mr  Jesse J  Ricks the president of the Union Carbide
      Carbon Corporation suggested that the stockholder had
     better take this question up in a private conference 
The dam is safe  A scene of power 
The dam is the father of the tunnel 
This is the valley’s work the white the shining

The dam is used when the tunnel is used 
The men and the water are never idle
have definitions 
This is a perfect fluid having no age nor hours
surviving scarless unaltered loving rest
willing to run forever to find its peace
in equal seas in currents of still glass 
Effects of friction  to fight and pass again
learning its power conquering boundaries
able to rise blind in revolts of tide
broken and sacrificed to flow resumed 
Collecting eternally power  Spender of power
torn never can be killed speeded in filaments
million its power can rest and rise forever
wait and be flexible  Be born again 
Nothing is lost even among the wars
imperfect flow confusion of force 
It will rise  These are the phases of its face 
It knows its seasons the waiting the sudden 
It changes  It does not die
