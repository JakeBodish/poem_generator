
Weep for the country in its present stateAnd of the gloom which still the future waitsThe proud confederate eagle heard the soundAnd with her flight fell prostrate to the groundWeep for the loss the country has sustainedBy which her now dependent is in jailThe grief of him who now the war survivedThe conscript husbands and the weeping wivesWeep for the seas of blood the battle costAnd souls that ever hope forever lostThe ravage of the field with no recruitTrees by the vengeance blasted to the rootWeep for the downfall oer your heads and chiefWho sunk without a medium of reliefWho fell beneath the hatchet of their prideThen like the serpent bit themselves and diedWeep for the downfall of your presidentWho far too late his folly must repentWho like the dragon did all heaven assailAnd dragged his friends to limbo with his tailWeep oer peculiar swelling coffers voidOur treasures left and all their banks destroyedTheir foundless notes replete with shame to allExpecting every day their final fallIn quest of profit never to be wonThen sadly fallen and forever down
