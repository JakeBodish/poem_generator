
Soon as the sun forsook the eastern main
The pealing thunder shook the heavnly plain
Majestic grandeur From the zephyrs wing
Exhales the incense of the blooming spring 
Soft purl the streams the birds renew their notes
And through the air their mingled music floats 
Through all the heavns what beauteous dies are spread
But the west glories in the deepest red
So may our breasts with evry virtue glow
The living temples of our God below
Filld with the praise of him who gives the light
And draws the sable curtains of the night
Let placid slumbers sooth each weary mind
At morn to wake more heavnly more refind
So shall the labours of the day begin
More pure more guarded from the snares of sin 
Nights leaden sceptre seals my drowsy eyes
Then cease my song till fair Aurora rise
