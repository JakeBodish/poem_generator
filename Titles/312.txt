She taught me the names of flowers calendula ranunculus Iceland
poppy  And the medicinal uses of herbs Fenugreek opens up a
stuffy head goldenseal lubricates the cracked mucous membranes 
Over a circa 1820 American dropleaf table she told me asparagus
was the broom of the kidneys  I hadnt understood at first and
thought shed used a German word I pictured as brüm and not as the
little stalks standing on their heads sweeping out the impurities  I
learned to make the perfect roux for soufflé and became her
efficient assistant in the kitchen dicing and chopping she once
told me with unparalleled patience  Then one day she began to
accidentally break my Depression glassware and I recalled how
shed giggled when she told me that in two years of marriage she
had single-handedly decimated her husbands glass collection
dating from 1790 to 1810 including a rare wedding goblet  In the
doorway to the back porch she stated simply that my presence
made her feel strangled it was nothing I was doing or could do  We
saw a therapist for six years while my collection dwindled then
became memory  With unparalleled patience I jumped through
hoop after burning hoop the therapist pointed out but I heard that
as praise for my prowess and continued to balance Bauer plates on
my nose on command hold growling tigers off with Windsor dining
room chairs juggle career job hope and nightly tempests with
unparalleled dexterity  I could reassemble anything shattered pictures
of us crossing the street with canes in the future my hand under her
elbow  My heart  But what I lacked I can see now was the ability
to dissemble  Finally she brought home a Cuisinart food processor
and I started hearing the minutes slicing away with ferocious velocity
time doing its soft-shoe faster and faster like Fred Astaire on
amphetamines  Memories of flowers and herbs were sacrificed to
the angry god of its vortex  Your voice is like acid on my skin she
said after twelve years then grabbed her Cuisinart and left me
behind like so much history
