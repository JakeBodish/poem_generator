
I can enter the morning with traces of an eternal dream to live
on a planet of women  we sing in the fertile forest caress on
lavender hills bathe beneath cascades of clear waters  and just
like that nude and wet we mount each other’s bodies  our
desire is a whale that searches for calm in the depth of the sea 
 
I smell sex in my hair when I awaken 
 
the dream perfumes all of my days  I go to the post office and
look for stamps with etchings of flowers and fruits so that I can
send letters to the women who loved me in my sleep 
 
we are in a world that is not ours  what do we do with the
dreams that touch our consciousness in the nude each night
 
our planet of women is nothing more than a dream  who knows
how many of us bathe in the woods or which ones of us have
wings that let us fly with our flesh it’s not for anyone to know 
fortunately we always dream paradise we make it ours  there
we find each other and live in our collective memory 
 
and so I smell sex in my hair when I awaken
