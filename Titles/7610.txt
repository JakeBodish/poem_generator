
In Indianapolis they drive
five hundred miles and end up
where they started survival
of the fittest  In the swamps
of Auburn and Elkhart
in the jungles of South Bend
one-cylinder chain-driven runabouts fall
to air-cooled V-4’s a-speed gearboxes
16-horse flat-twin midships engines 
carcasses left behind
by monobloc motors electric starters
3-speed gears six cylinders 2-chain drive
overhead cams supercharged
to 88 miles an hour in second gear the age
of Leviathan        There is grandeur in this view of life
    as endless forms
    most beautiful and wonderful
    are being evolved
