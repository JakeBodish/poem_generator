
Yesterday I lost a country 
I was in a hurry
and didnt notice when it fell from me
like a broken branch from a forgetful tree 
Please if anyone passes by
and stumbles across it
perhaps in a suitcase
open to the sky
or engraved on a rock
like a gaping wound
or wrapped
in the blankets of emigrants
or canceled
like a losing lottery ticket
or helplessly forgotten
in Purgatory
or rushing forward without a goal
like the questions of children
or rising with the smoke of war
or rolling in a helmet on the sand
or stolen in Ali Babas jar
or disguised in the uniform of a policeman
who stirred up the prisoners
and fled
or squatting in the mind of a woman
who tries to smile
or scattered
like the dreams
of new immigrants in America 
If anyone stumbles across it
return it to me please 
Please return it sir 
Please return it madam 
It is my country     
I was in a hurry
when I lost it yesterday
