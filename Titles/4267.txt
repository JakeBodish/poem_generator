
Here comes rain on our roof
It stays just long enough
to tickle me into writing this 
It stays just long enough
for everybody to get into
a pair of PJs silk-cotton blend
and then goes poof At our best
we exude awesomeness  At our best
we are destined to turn pale
with the rest of humanity 
We are awesome and quick as
decomposing sticks at a trail’s
end  We bend dreams into circles
of green zone satire  We have
mahogany stuffed in our mahogany
ears  To all who are not us
we are sorry to say You’re welcome
Nature thankfully adores a rumor
A sunset A glacier Clouds
glimmer and cast inevitable
shadows off the groundswell
footrest  I remember you from
that time before we first met
when our eyes were wet
like summertime coasters
as we Ubered noiselessly
between pews  The aristocrats
are failing to panhandle via email 
One aristocrat is sleepily winding
through the face of another
