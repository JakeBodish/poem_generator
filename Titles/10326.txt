
My father was a tall man and yet the ripened ryeWould come above his shoulders the spears shot up so high My father was a tall man and yet the tasseled cornWould hide him when he cut the stalks upon a frosty morn The green things grew so lushly in the valley of my birthWhere else could one witness the luxuriance of earthThe plow would turn so rhythmically the loose unfettered loamThere was no need of effort to drive the coulter home My father walked behind his team before the sun was highFine as a figure on a frieze cut sharp against the sky And when he swung the cradle in the yellow of the grainHe could command all eyes around or when he drove the wain I wonder if his acres now that lie so far awayAre waiting for his footprint at the coming of the day I wonder if the brown old barn that still is standing longAnd ghostly cattle in the stalls are waiting for his song
