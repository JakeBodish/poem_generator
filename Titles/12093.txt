
There is something men and women living in housesDon’t understand  The old alchemists standingNear their stoves hinted at it a thousand times Ravens at night hide in an old woman’s shoe A four-year-old speaks some ancient language We have lived our own death a thousand times Each sentence we speak to friends means the oppositeAs well  Each time we say “I trust in God” it meansGod has already abandoned us a thousand times Mothers again and again have knelt in churchIn wartime asking God to protect their sonsAnd their prayers were refused a thousand times The baby loon follows the mother’s sleekBody for months  By the end of summer sheHas dipped her head into Rainy Lake a thousand times Robert you’ve wasted so much of your lifeSitting indoors to write poems  Would youDo that again I would a thousand times
