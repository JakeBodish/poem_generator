I 
In the garden it’s there  Even when you’re inside you feel it
as though it were you standing naked among the weeds
 
the tips of the bougainvillea bursting into flame your nipples
ruffled like the skin of a lake by a breeze 
 
You worship the invisible body like an old-fashioned lover from afar
loving the specificity of space between you 
 
Sometimes at night it stretches out on the empty side
of the bed stares at you with the length of its invisible surface 
 
Every contour of your body not filled by you is molded
by the attentiveness of the invisible body whose breath surrounds
     you 
 
It’s more than prayer it wants more than language with its
     conditions 
The invisible body demands you invent new senses to receive it
 
new places on your body to marvel at its subtlety
like the eyes of the deaf percussionist that perceive sound 
 
II 
The invisible body wants you to become a satellite dish
tuned to what exists only because your body calls to it 
 
Like the woman who had her kitchen remodeled to make room
for the microwave she’d entered a contest for  Then won 
 
III 
When asked whether falling in love was about acquisitiveness
about the ego the seventy-five-year-old poet
 
responded that the ego had nothing to do with it
it was the need for union with the beloved 
 
Rumi asks Who is it we spend our entire lives loving 
 
IV 
How then do you measure the invisible body
which resists commitment but is faithful
 
Is it clear who the beloved is when no clear
body exists that can be measured against a standard
 
V 
The invisible body sometimes acquires a body it’s so convincing
it takes you a while to figure out it’s really the invisible body 
 
Like someone who has been reading your journal
it has decoded from your petty daily complaints the open sesame
 
that slides the stone from the hidden cave’s opening
and cleans you out while you sleep leaving a sarcastic note 
 
It wants you to know it was doing you a favor besides
how else did you think you’d discover the cave’s precise location
 
When Aphrodite sharpens you you sacrifice a little of yourself
willingly as a knife does so that you may become better at it 
 
VI 
This is the point at which the invisible body speaks
in italics the Ouija board of poetry 
 In my mind says the invisible body that time capsule shuttlingthrough space I hold in all the languages of the world
 your love rushed like holographic platters to a tablesteaming into the future long after you’ve ceased to shine
 the silver faces of your beloved bobbing out of the darknessthe black velvet pillow of your life on which you offer them for view 
 
VII 
The invisible body is created out of your longing your longing
compressing invisible molecules together into an absence you
     recognize 
 
That is the way one blind man sees the world after the fact
in photographs he took once he had passed through it
