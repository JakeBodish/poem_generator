
We start stopping when she’s afraid
something bad will happen  Don’t worry
I say all will be well 
 
How could she know She’s never
read it never heard of Elizabeth
and Jane never wanted Mr  Darcy  Like me
 
she needs to know how things will end 
I know Elizabeth will be fine  As I knew
last week my sister weeping that Elinor–
 
sobbing begging–wouldn’t lose Marianne 
It’s Jane Austen My sister doesn’t know that
in Austen nothing really bad happens  I leave her
 
on the couch with the last hours 
How much my sister will have to endure
alone with this new drama 
 
Later her message  The last one
in which she will sound like herself Hi it’s me  The movie was unbelievable  
 Unbelievable
