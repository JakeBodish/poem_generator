Holding her steady into the pitch and roll
in raw Midwestern hands ten thousand tons
of winter wheat for the fall of Rome
still swallowing the hunger of the war
the binnacle glows like an open fire
east-southeast and steady
Anderssen the Viking mate
belaboring me for contraband
my little book of Einstein that
“Commie Jew ” So much for the social instincts
pacifism humanism the frail
and noble causes  I speak my piece
for western civ light bends    
stars warp     mass converts    
“Pipe dreams” says the Dane “pipe dreams ”
“Well mate remember
those Jewish dreams made nightmares
out of Hiroshima and
blew us out of uniform alive ”
He stomps down off the bridge some day
he’ll fire me off his rusty
liberty I read too much 
The ocean tugs and wrestles with
ten thousand deadweight tons
of charity trembling on
degrees and minutes  Anderssen
steams back in with coffee to
contest the stars with Einstein full ahead 
We haven’t come to Darwin

Freezing on the flying bridge
staring at the night for nothing
running lights of freighters lost
in a blur of blowing snow
we hold on through the midnight watch
waiting out the bells 
With Einstein in our wake the tricks
are easier liberty
churns on ten knots an hour
toward Rome  One starry night
we ride at last with Darwin on
the Beagle endless ocean sea
sickness revelations
of Toxodon and Megalonyx a voyage
old as the Eocene the watery death
of Genesis  The going
gets rough again the threat of all those bones
churning the heavy swells Anderssen
a true believer skeptical
and Darwin trapped in a savage earthquake
the heave of coastal strata conjuring
the wreck of England lofty houses gone
government in chaos
violence and pillage through the land
and afterward
fossils gleaming white along
the raw ridges 
“Limeys ” Anderssen puts his benediction
to empire “Stupid Limeys ” After that
we breathe a bit and watch the stars and tell
sad stories of the death of tribes the bones
the countless bones we talk about
the war we talk about
extinction

Okinawa Iwo Jima
slouching toward Tokyo the only good Jap
is a dead Jap 
We must get the bomb Einstein writes
to F D R  waking from
the dreams of peace the noble causes
get it first before
the Nazis do  The only good Nazi
is an extinct Nazi 
At the death of Hiroshima all day long
we celebrate extinction chugalugging
free beer down at the px teen-
age kids in khaki puking pints
of three-point-two in honor
of the fire no more island-hopping now
to the murderous heart of empire 
Later in the luxury of peace
the bad dreams come  “Certainly”
Darwin broods “no fact
in the long history of the world
is so startling as the wide and repeated
extermination
of its inhabitants ”

Off somewhere to starboard the Canaries
Palma Tenerife sunrise
backlights the rugged peaks as Darwin
twenty-two years old gazes at
the clouds along the foothills 
Longitudes ease westward it’s
my birthday twenty-two years old
as Tenerife falls into the sunset
I’m as greedy for the old world
as Darwin for the new Bahia Desire
the palms and crimson flowers
of the Mediterranean clear water
dancing with mines  Ahead of us
a tanker burns the war
will never end

“You talk a lot” says the melancholy Dane 
“You sure you’re not Jewish yourself
You got a funny name ”
“Well mate I’m pure Celtic on one side
pure Orphan on the other therefore half
of anything at all Jewish Danish
what you will a problem isn’t it
for Hitler say or the Klan
or even Gregor Mendel sweating out the summer
in his pea patch”
The fact is I know those ancestors
floating through my sleepan animal that breathed water
had a great swimming tail
an imperfect skull undoubtedly
hermaphrodite
