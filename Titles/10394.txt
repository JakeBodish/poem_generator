
Finding an old book on a basement shelf    gray spine bent and reading it again   I met my former unfamiliar self   some of her notes and scrawls so alien   that though I tried I couldnt get behind   this gloss or that back to the time she wrote   to guess what experiences she had in mind   the living context of some scribbled note   or see the girl beneath the purple ink   who chose this phrase or that to underline   the mood the boy that lay behind her thinking     but they were thoughts I recognized as mine   and though there were words I couldnt even read   blobs and cross-outs and though not a jot   remained of her old existence I agreed   with the young annotators every thought   A clever girl  So what would she see fit   to comment on and what would she have to say   about the years that she and I have written   since before we put the book away
