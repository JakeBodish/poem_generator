
Twelve people most of us strangers stand in a room
in Ann Arbor drinking Cribari from jars 
Then two young men who cooked him
carry him to the table
on a large square of plywood his body
striped like a tiger cat’s from the basting
his legs long much longer than a cat’s
and the striped hide as shiny as vinyl 
Now I see his head as he takes his place
at the center of the table
his wide pig’s head and he looks like the javelina
that ran in front of the car in the desert outside Tucson
and I am drawn to him my brother the pig
with his large ears cocked forward
with his tight snout with his small ferocious teeth
in a jaw propped open
by an apple  How bizarre this raw apple clenched
in a cooked face Then I see his eyes
his eyes cramped shut his no-eyes his eyes like X’s
in a comic strip when the character gets knocked out 
This afternoon they read directions
from a book The eyeballs must be removed
or they will burst during roasting
