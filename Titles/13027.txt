
All along the valley stream that flashest whiteDeepening thy voice with the deepening of the nightAll along the valley where thy waters flowI walkd with one I loved two and thirty years ago All along the valley while I walkd to-dayThe two and thirty years were a mist that rolls awayFor all along the valley down thy rocky bedThy living voice to me was as the voice of the deadAnd all along the valley by rock and cave and treeThe voice of the dead was a living voice to me
