My marbles stayas mixedas my metaphors  As my myths As myself 
At parties my favoriteicebreaker involves asking strangers
to describe themselveswith three words  Their descriptions are a slipping

Sometimes I feel so Socratic oft-laureled poison-palmed
toga-partied exasperated by the massesI wouldn’t have guessed ambitious Free-spirited you don’t say Other times I feel like the womanrambling among the vapors escaping the ground
in Iceland’s volcanic canyonmaking a busan em dashin a rest stop
where some fifty-odd persons

cannot be more cedarqua waxwing  Eventually what we’re looking
for appears  Sometimes incitation opens

to realize we are the womanin the search party lookingfor ourselves to poetry In moments of ecstasywe are lifted
