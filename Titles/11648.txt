
Im sitting here on the old patio
beside your absence  It is a black well 
Wed be playing now      I can hear Mama yell   
Boys Calm down Wed laugh and off Id go   
to hide where youd never look      under the stairs   
in the hall the attic      Then youd do the same 
Miguel we were too good at that game    
Everything would always end in tears 
No one was laughing on that August night
you went to hide away again so late
it was almost dawn  But now your brothers through
with this hunting and hunting and never finding you 
The shadows crowd him  Miguel will you hurry   
and show yourself Mama will only worry
