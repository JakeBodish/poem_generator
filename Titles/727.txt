
It’s a strange courageyou give me ancient star
 Shine alone in the sunrisetoward which you lend no part
 
                          I
Shine alone shine nakedly shine like bronze
that reflects neither my face nor any inner part
of my being shine like fire that mirrors nothing 
 
                         II
Lend no part to any humanity that suffuses
you in its own light 
Be not chimera of morning
Half-man half-star 
Be not an intelligence
Like a widow’s bird
Or an old horse
