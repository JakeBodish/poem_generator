
In her last notes when her hand began
to tremble my mother tried to teach it
 
the penmanship she was known for
how to make the slanted stems
 
of the ps and ds the descending
roundness of the capital ms the long
 
loops of the fs crossed at the center
sending it back again and again
 
until each message was the same
a record of her insistence that the hand
 
return her to the way she was before
and of all the ways the hand had disobeyed
