
Still to be neat still to be dressed As you were going to a feast Still to be powdered still perfumed Lady it is to be presumed Though arts hid causes are not found All is not sweet all is not sound  Give me a look give me a face That makes simplicity a grace Robes loosely flowing hair as freeSuch sweet neglect more taketh me                        Than all thadulteries of art  They strike mine eyes but not my heart
