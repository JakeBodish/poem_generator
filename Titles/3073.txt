
The late Gracie Allen was a very lucid comedienne
Especially in the way that lucid means shining and bright 
What her husband George Burns called her illogical logic
Made a halo around our syntax and ourselves as we laughed 
George Burns most often was her artful inconspicuous straight man 
He could move people about stage construct skits and scenes write
And gather jokes  They were married as long as ordinary magic
Would allow thirty-eight years until Gracie Allens death 
In her fifties Gracie Allen developed a heart condition 
She would call George Burns when her heart felt funny and fluttered
Hed give her a pill and theyd hold each other till the palpitation
Stopped just a few minutes many times and pills  As magic fills
Then fulfilled must leave a space one day Gracie Allens
               heart fluttered
And hurt and stopped  George Burns said unbelievingly to the doctor
               But I still have some of the pills
