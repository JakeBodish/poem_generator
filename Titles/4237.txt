
I’m in charge of a cage  I know those that won’t 
I don’t mean can’t  Just won’t  There’s a roster
for Tuesdays Fridays  Dogs to die 
The disconsolate the abandoned those with recurrent
symptoms the incorrigible mutt   oh a dozen
choices by way of reasons  Even so
some won’t  Won’t play along once their number’s
up  The “rainbow bridge” in the offing
as the posher clinics put it a pig’s ear
as a final treat a venison chew the profession
behaving beautifully at a time like this 
Still those that won’t  Won’t go nicely I mean
with a gaze to melt a last slobbed lick 
Those with a soul’s defiance though embarrassment
in the lunchroom should you come at that one
Even after the bag is zipped you feel itWe’re real at the end as you are buster  We sniff
the wind  What say if we say it together
