
She stands as pale as Parian statues stand
Like Cleopatra when she turned at bay
And felt her strength above the Roman sway
And felt the aspic writhing in her hand 
Her face is steadfast toward the shadowy land
For dim beyond it looms the light of day
Her feet are steadfast all the arduous way
That foot-track hath not wavered on the sand 
She stands there like a beacon thro the night
A pale clear beacon where the storm-drift is
She stands alone a wonder deathly white
She stands there patient nerved with inner might
Indomitable in her feebleness
Her face and will athirst against the light
