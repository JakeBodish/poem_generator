
While the tennis ball went back and forth in timeA girl was burning  While the tonic took its greenyAcid lime a girl was burning  While the ruby sun fell
From a cloud’s bent claws and Wimbledon was wonAnd lost we sprawled along the shore in chairsWe breathed the azure airs alongside
A girl with the thinnest arms all scarred and scoredWith marks she’d made herself  She sat with us in flames
That not all saw or saw but couldn’t say at riskOf seeming impolite  And later we’d all thinkOf the monk who’d doused himself with gas
Lit a match then sat unmoving and alert amidDevouring light  She didn’t speak  She touchedNo aspect of our silly selves 
I was the awkward guest everybody hardly knew She was an almost ghost her mother sawErasing the edges of herself each day
Smudging the lines like charcoal while her parentsRedrew her secretly into being over andAgain each night and dawn and sleepless
All years long  Having seen that mother’s loveI testify It was ocean endless  One drop could’veBrought to life the deadest Christ and she
Emptied herself into that blazing child with all her mightAnd stared a hundred million miles intoThe girl’s slender dwindling shape 
Her father was the devoted king of helicopter padAnd putting green  His baby burned as weAll watched in disbelief 
I was the facile friend of friends insisting on a hugWho hadn’t been along for years of doctors wardsAnd protocols  I forced her sadness close  I said
C’mon let’s hug it out  Her arms were whiteBirch twigs that scissored stiffly at my neck till sheSlid on  That night we watched
Some fireworks on the dewy lawn for it wasIndependence Day  Soon after she was gone She was the flaming tower we all daredTo jump from  So she burned
