
We were apart yet day by dayI bade my heart more constant be I bade it keep the world awayAnd grow a home for only theeNor feard but thy love likewise grewLike mine each day more tried more true The fault was grave I might have knownWhat far too soon alas I learnd The heart can bind itself aloneAnd faith may oft be unreturnd Self-swayd our feelings ebb and swell Thou lovst no more Farewell FarewellFarewell and thou thou lonely heartWhich never yet without remorseEven for a moment didst departFrom thy remote and sphered courseTo haunt the place where passions reign Back to thy solitude againBack with the conscious thrill of shameWhich Luna felt that summer-nightFlash through her pure immortal frameWhen she forsook the starry heightTo hang over Endymions sleepUpon the pine-grown Latmian steep Yet she chaste queen had never provedHow vain a thing is mortal loveWandering in Heaven far removed But thou hast long had place to proveThis truth to prove and make thine ownThou hast been shalt be art alone Or if not quite alone yet theyWhich touch thee are unmating things Ocean and clouds and night and dayLorn autumns and triumphant springsAnd life and others joy and painAnd love if love of happier men Of happier men for they at leastHave dreamd two human hearts might blendIn one and were through faith releasedFrom isolation without endProlongd nor knew although not lessAlone than thou their loneliness
