In which I try to decipher
                          the story it tells
this syntax of monuments                          flanking the old courthouse
                                       here a rough outline
like the torso of a woman                          great with child                                        a steatite boulder from which                          the Indians girdled the core
                                                     to make of it a bowl                                       and left in the stone a wound here
the bronze figure of Thomas Jefferson                                       quill in hand inscribing                          a language of freedom                                                    a creation story                                        his hand poised at the word                           happiness  There is not yet an ending                                       no period the single mark
intended or misprinted that changes                          the meaning of everything 
Here too for the Confederacy
                          an obelisk oblivious
               in its name a word                          that also meant the symbol
to denote in ancient manuscripts               the spurious corrupt or doubtful
                                             at its base forged                          in concrete a narrative               of valor virtue states rights  
Here it is only the history of a word                          obelisk               that points us toward                          whats not there all of it
palimpsest each mute object                repeating a single refrain                Remember this
