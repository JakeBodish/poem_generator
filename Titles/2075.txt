
Jook joints about to come alive
Its like a bee outside a hive
And when the hive begins to hum
Its like a dim and distant drum
And when the drum begins to beat
Its like a circus down the street
And when the street begins to fill
Its like a sudden summer chill
And just as summer simmers down
Its like the fireworks over town 
Dont matter what the preachers say 
This congregations here to stay
Cause when the jook joint comes alive
Is when the Delta blues arrive
