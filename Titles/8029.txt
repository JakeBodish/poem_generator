Prologue
If the sea could dream and if the sea   
were dreaming now the dream
would be the usual one Of the Flesh    
The letter written in the dream would go   
something like Forgive me love Blue 

    I  The Viewing A ChorusO what then did he look like
                                                   He had a good body And how came you to know this
                                                 His body was naked Say the sound of his body 
                                             His body was quiet Say again quiet
                            He was sleeping You are sure of this Sleeping

    II  Pavilion
Sometimes a breeze a canvas   
flap will rise and inside   
someone stirs a bird a flower
One is thinking Should there be
thirst I have only to reach   
for the swollen bag of skin
beside me I have only to touch
my mouth that is meant for a flower   
to it and drink
