
how can I tell you
baby oh honey youll
never know the ride
the ride of a lowered chevy
slithering through the
blue dotted night along
Riverside Drive Española
 
poetry rides the wings
of a ’59 Impala
yes it does
and it points
chrome antennae towards
 
’Burque stations rocking
oldies Van Morrison
brown eyed girls
Creedence and a
bad moon rising
over Chimayo
 
and I guess
it also rides
on muddy Subarus
tuned into new-age radio
on the frigid road
to Taos on weekend
ski trips
 
yes baby
you and I are two
kinds of wheels
on the same road
 
listen listen
to the lonesome humming
of the tracks we leave
behind
