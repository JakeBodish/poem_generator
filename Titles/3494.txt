
Shows over folks  And didnt October do
A bang-up job Crisp breezes full-throated cries
Of migrating geese low-floating coral moon 
Nothing left but fools gold in the trees 
Did I love it enough the full-throttle foliage
While it lasted Was I dazzled The bees
Have up and quit their last-ditch flights of forage
And gone to shiver in their winter clusters 
Field mice hit the barns big squirrels gorge
On busted chestnuts  A sky like hardened plaster
Hovers  The pasty river its next of kin
Coughs up reed grass fat as feather dusters 
Even the swarms of kids have given in
To winters big excuse boxed-in allure
TVs ricochet light behind pulled curtains 
The days throw up a closed sign around four 
The hapless customer whod wanted something
Arrives to find lights out a bolted door
