to marry the Second Mayors daughter by twelve noon  The   
order arrived three minutes of 
I already had a wife the Second Mayor was childless but I   
did it 
Next they told me to shave off my fathers beard  All right    
No matter that hed been a eunuch and had succumbed in   
early childhood I did it I shaved him 
Then they told me to burn a village next a fair-sized town   
then a city a bigger city a small down-at-heels country   
then one of the great powers then another another an-
other In fact they went right on until theyd told me to   
burn up every man-made thing on the face of the earth And   
I did it I burned away every last trace I left nothing nothing   
of any kind whatever 
Then they told me to blow it all to hell and gone And I blew   
it all to hell and gone oh didnt I     
Now they said put it back together again put it all back the   
way it was when you started 
Well      it was my turn then to tell them something Shucks
