
As I leave for work she holds out her arms and I
bend to lift her       always heavier than I remember
because in my mind she is still that seedling bough
I used to cradle in one elbow  Her hug is honest
fierce forgiving  I think of Oregons coastal pines
wind-bent even on quiet days theyve grown in ways
the Pacific breeze has blown them all their lives 
And how will my daughter grow Last night I dreamed
of a mid-ocean gale a howl among writhing waterspouts
I dont know what it meant or if its still distant
or already here  I know only how I hug my daughter
my arms grown taut with the thought of that wind
