I have some sad news for youI am but a symbol a shadow cast on paperIf only you knew how things look within me at the momentTrees covered in white blossomThe remains of my physical selfDo you really find my appearance so attractiveDarling I have been telling an awful lot of lies latelyIf only I knew what you are doing nowStanding in the garden and gazing out into the deserted streetNot a mermaid but a lovely human beingThe whole thing reminds me of the man trying to rescue a birdcage from the burning houseI feel compelled to express myself poetically I am not normally a hunter of relics but    It was this childhood scene    My mother     All the while I kept thinking her face has such a wild look    as though she had never existedThe fact is I have not yet seen her in daylightDistance must remain distanceA few proud buildings your lovely photographI find this loss very hard to bearThe bells are ringing I don’t quite know whyWhat makes all autobiographies worthless is after all their mendacityYesterday and today have been bad daysThis oceanic feeling continuous inner monologuesI said “All the beautiful things I still have to say will have to remain unsaid” and the writing table flooded
