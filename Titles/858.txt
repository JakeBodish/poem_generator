
Look Delia how w esteem the half-blown roseThe image of thy blush and summers honourWhilst yet her tender bud doth undiscloseThat full of beauty Time bestows upon her No sooner spreads her glory in the airBut straight her wide-blown pomp comes to declineShe then is scornd that late adornd the fairSo fade the roses of those cheeks of thine No April can revive thy witherd flowersWhose springing grace adorns thy glory nowSwift speedy Time featherd with flying hoursDissolves the beauty of the fairest brow Then do not thou such treasure waste in vainBut love now whilst thou mayst be lovd again
