                     I
 
The ferry furrows
the foam
leaving a wake
that quickly settles
and forgets us
as it has forgotten
all those
who’ve opened these waters
fisherman monk pilgrim and pagan
some foundering here 
Our mainland
world diminishes 
There is respite 
A cloud engulfs us
out of nowhere
as if the miraculous
were about to appear 
The veil lifts
to reveal the small Skellig
and Skellig Michael
rising like chapel and cathedral 
 
                      II
 
We forget speech hypnotized by the climb
concentrating on narrow rock-hewn steps
that spiral up like the gyres
of the Book of Kells whirling in labyrinths
of knowledge turmoil and eternity 
They lead to the beehive huts and oratories
packed with a congregation of sightseers
who whisper in disbelief and reverence
at how those sometime monks lived
in this wind-tugged cloister of shells 
 
We browse in each dome’s live absence
and picnic above the graveyard
that’s no bigger than a currach
with a crucifix for helmsman
navigating his crew to the island of the dead 
We’re eyed by the staunch monkish puffins 
Our tongues loosen but in keeping
with the somberness of this sun-haloed place
we chat about the world with an earnestness
that would embarrass us on the mainland 
 
You tell of medieval monks charting world maps
with countries drawn as humans gorging upon
each other’s entangled bodies  We go on to
the lands and demons of the world of poetry 
I’m flummoxed when you ask what poetry is 
I recall how the earliest musical instruments
were hewn out of bones and that poets
carve their words out of those gone before 
They are the primitive musicians who beat
and blow words back to life  More than that I don’t know

…
 
That dusk at Dún an Óir we slaughtered even
the pregnant whimpering women methodically
while a bloodstained sun drowned in the ocean 
Each fetus struggled in the belly
of each slain mother as desperately
as a lobster dropped in a boiling pot 
Had shed blood been ink I could still be
quilling The Faerie Queene but I did not
allow a drop to blot a mere sonnet
that you trapped in complicity can never
quite break free of  Admit it hypocrite
In your time few are not guilty of slaughter 
Even the page you’ll pen this upon is of pine
that Amazonians were shot for  I could go on 
                                                                                   Edmund Spenser
I lifted the pitch of my grief
    above the storm-lashing waves
for my world breaking on the reefs
    of foreign land-grabbing knaves
 
who ignore dependence upon
    the lowliest plants and creatures
as the hermit crab and cloak anemone
    depend on one another 
 
But no matter what you must
    keen for the world’s theft
as I keened mine despite knowing
    soon no one may be left 
 
                                                                                   Aodhagán Ó Rathaille
Lend an ear to one of your own kind
   and do not let yourself be caught
by the winds of lust like Dante’s starlings
   blown this way and that by every gust 
 
I myself was borne on this wind
   as I rode across country
always wary that around the next bend
   my life would catch up with me 
My rakish ways squandered energy
   that I should have instilled in song
more worthy of the muse-gift given to me
   than my odd aisling
 
Pay particular heed to me especially
   since your word-talent is less than mine 
I’m still too bushed to eke out a last line 
                                                                                    Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin
Sing up front
cold-shouldering
the fashionable
low key of your time
closed cautious and crabbit
as a farmer 
 
Sing as open-throated
as my curlew keen 
I supped the red wine
of Art’s blood
as he lay slain
already becoming Cork mud 
 
Sing as full-throated
as my unmatched plaint
matching my words
to his cold body
that would never again
rouse to my touch 
My hands wept
that day’s icy rain
as I swore to undo
that kowtowing
dribble of a man
who slew my Art
of the winged white horse 
 
The spirit of that mare
I rode fleeter than any hare
fleeter than any deer
fleeter than the wind
through Munster’s open country 
 
Sing your provenance
our elder province 
                                                                                     Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill
I sang not for my own or for beautys sake
as much as to keep our spirits fired 
knowing as long as we sang wed not break 
refusing to allow the country be shired 
But it was too much when even our lands
turned hostile and drove us like lapwings
in the hard winter together in dying bands
our swollen bellies pregnant with nothing  
Even the birds seemed to give up singing  
So I lay down and relinquished song 
But I should have kept up my amhrán-ing 
adapting and transmuting their tongue  
Transform the spirit of where you belong 
make something right out of whats wrong  
                                                                                     Tomás Rua Ó Súilleabháin
Tell of those weather-sketched
    Attic islanders
who half-tamed their school
    of rocky Blaskets
water spouting from the blowholes
    of cliffs  
Tell how they were forced
    from their Ithaca
still dreaming in the surf-rush 
    of Irish
the inland longing for the lilt
    of the sea 
In them uncover the destiny
   of everyone
for all are exiled and in search 
    of a home
as you settle the eroding 
    island of each poem  
                                                                                        Robin Flower
…
The islands standing army
of gannets fiercely snap
stab and peck one another 
Few could match
the spite I unleashed 
on any who encroached 
into my territory  I spat 
with petrel accuracy  
I should have had the wisdom 
of the sad-eyed puffins 
who let everyone come close
sensing few mean hurt 
though when forced to tussle
theyll show their worth  
So learn from me  
When I come to mind
dont recall how feisty 
I knocked nests of words
over the edge
splattering on the rocks 
the crude squwaks of other 
ravaging wing-elbowing birds 
rather think of the winged poems 
I hatched seen 
regardless of time and place 
gliding and gyring 
with their own grace  
                                                                                          Patrick Kavanagh
Life when it is gone is like a woman
you were glad to be quit of only to find
yourself years later longing for her
catching her scent on a crowded street  
Tell us of the seagull plundering your picnic 
before it wakes you  Tell us of the rain
tapping a pane while youre ensconced
by the fire cradling a pregnant brandy glass  
                                                                                            Louis MacNeice
Can you still hear a distant train whistle blow 
Wet my whistle with a slug of Guinness 
What is the texture of fresh-fallen snow
Do girls still wear their hair in braid
Whats tea Whats the smell of the sea
Tell me  Tell me  I am beginning to fade 
          
                                                                                             Dylan Thomas
                      IV
The alarming silhouetted bird
has a preternatural quality 
as it flutters about
my head drawing me
from sleeps underworld  
I resist its pull  
Everything turns
into dreams usual montage  
Another figure emerges 
but says nothing 
as if thats what he came to say  
His face merges into
one of a gagged female  
She shimmers and vanishes  
Dolphins break
beyond Blind Mans Cove
returning the dead
to Bull Island transmitting
their encrypted underwater Morse  
The savant local ferryman
informs us that Skellig Michael
was once a druidic site  
His oil-wrinkled hands tug
the engine cord
coaxing our boat
out of the cliff-shaded cove 
We withdraw
into the distance 
leaving a disgruntling sense
that weve only touched the tip
of these dark icebergs
