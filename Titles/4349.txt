
i was born
at the rupture the root where
i split from my parallel self  i split from
the girl i also could have been
 her name  easy  i know the story
all her life  my mother wanted
a girl named for a flower
whose oil scents all
our mothers 
petals wrung
for their perfume
i was planted
land became ocean became land anew
its shape refusing root in my fallow mouth
cleaving my life neatly
 my name  taken from a dead woman
to remember  to fill an aperture with
cut jasmine in a bowl
our longing
our mothers’
wilting
garlands hanging from our necks
