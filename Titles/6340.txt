
It’s common to live properly to pretendyou don’t feel heat or grief wave nightly
at Miss Fugue and Mister Goggles before divinginto your nightcap before reading yourself
a bedtime story or watching your beloved sinkto the bottom of a lake and noting his absence
in your log  The next day you drop his clothes offat Goodwill like a sack of mail from a warplane
then hobble back to your hovel like a knight movingonly in Ls  It is comfortable to be alive this way
especially now but it makes you so vulnerable to shock   you ignore the mortgage and find a falconer’s glove
in your yard whole hand still inside  Or you arrive homeafter a long day to discover your children have grown
suddenly hideous and unlovable  What I’m tryingto say is I think it’s okay to accelerate around
corners to grunt back at the mailman and swallow allyour laundry quarters  So much of everything is dumb
baffle water puts out fire my diseases can becomeyour diseases and two hounds will fight over a feather
because feathers are strange  All I want is to finallytake off my cowboy hat and show you my jeweled
horns  If we slow dance I will ask you not to tugon them but secretly I will want that very much
