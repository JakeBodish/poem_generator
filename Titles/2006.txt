
Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hateHate of my sin grounded on sinful loving O but with mine compare thou thine own stateAnd thou shalt find it merits not reprovingOr if it do not from those lips of thineThat have profaned their scarlet ornamentsAnd sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine Robbed others’ beds’ revenues of their rents Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov’st thoseWhom thine eyes woo as mine importune theeRoot pity in thy heart that when it grows Thy pity may deserve to pitied be      If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide    By self-example mayst thou be denied
