
To love is to tell the story of the world      There was
an ocean with a boat     mountains     a meadow     too painful to stare
at directly  Haven’t I been here before Yes      No     not quite here 
“It is not as if” the philosopher writes “an I exists
independently over here and then simply loses a you over there ”
In the mist a man rigs the Suzelle little red boat Loved labored for months learning to tie the right knot  The exact
and only knot that will keep the vessel tethered  She rehearsed
for the worst possible thing  “The attachment to you” it is written
“is part of what composes who I am ” I knowknew
those hands hers  I watched her dust the sourdough with flour
at midnight a moon between her fingers      Gone
went Loved  But the half-world of her in me
was me      It was lit by the moon
