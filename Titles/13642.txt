
Its the Fourth of July the flags
are painting the town
the plastic forks and knives
are laid out like a parade 
And Im grilling Ive got my apron
Ive got potato salad macaroni relish
Ive got a hat shaped   
like the state of Pennsylvania 
I ask my father whats his pleasure
and he says Hot dog medium rare
and then Hamburger sure   
whats the big difference   
as if hes really asking 
I put on hamburgers and hot dogs   
slice up the sour pickles and Bermudas
uncap the condiments  The paper napkins   
are fluttering away like lost messages 
Youre running around my mother says   
like a chicken with its head loose 
Ma I say you mean cut off
loose and cut off   being as far apart   
as say son and daughter 
She gives me a quizzical look as though   
Ive been caught in some impropriety 
I love you and your sister just the same she says
Sure my grandmother pipes in
youre both our children so why worry
Thats not the point I begin telling them
and Im comparing words to fish now   
like the ones in the sea at Port Said   
or like birds among the date palms by the Nile
unrepentantly elusive wild    
Sonia my father says to my mother
what the hell is he talking about
Hes on a ball my mother says 
                                                      
Thats roll I say throwing up my hands
as in hot dog hamburger dinner roll    
And what about roll out the barrels my mother asks
and my father claps his hands Why sure he says
lets have some fun and launches   
into a polka twirling my mother   
around and around like the happiest top   
and my uncle is shaking his head saying
You could grow nuts listening to us   
and Im thinking of pistachios in the Sinai
burgeoning without end   
pecans in the South the jumbled
flavor of them suddenly in my mouth
wordless confusing
crowding out everything else
