
After a funeral they were covered with black cloth
some draped with shawls like a scalloped valance 
Leftover sewing scraps wool linen synthetic
anything to shroud the odd-shaped mirrors
though sometimes a corner was exposed like a woman
whose ankle peeks forbidden from under a long skirt 
 
A mourner must shun vanity during shiva focusing inward
but as a child I wondered if this were to avoid ghosts
for dont the dead take their time leaving
Im of a generation where grandparents disappeared
great aunts with European accents
rarely an explanation provided to us children 
 
My mother died too young 
With a baby in arms I couldnt bear to fling
that dark cloth over the glass 
After all she had come back from the dead so often
even the doctors could not explain it 
Each time I looked in a mirror my mother gazed back 
I could never tell if she were trying to tell me something
or to take the baby with her
