
We is gator teeth hanging from the rear-
view mirror as sickle cells suckle at Big
Momma’s teats  We is dragonfly
choppers hovering above Walden Pond 
We is spinal cords shedding like the skin
of a cottonmouth  We is Psalm 23 and
the Pastor’s chattering chicklets  We isa good problem to have  We is throats
constricting and the grape juice
of Jesus  We is Roach and Mingus in
Birdland  We is body electric eyes
watering with moonshine glossy lips
sticky with lard  We is half brothers in
headlock arm-wrestling in the dirt 
We is Vaseline rubbed into knocked
knees and cracked elbows  We is ham
hocks making love to kidney beans  We
is Orpheus lute in hand asking do we
have a problem
