should I look at you and should
I change my life
Monarch you makeyour orange assent to death And how much dexteritycan you really teach meDoes your courageeven map onto theseworldly obligationsto friends my job desirefor a little affection in the latehours of the evening etc I cant put myself ever in your head But I can lieon your wing with my left eye letting my right dart forward as you do Dont ask somethingwith a lifespanhow to change your life Ask something you cant believe ever lived
