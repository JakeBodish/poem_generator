
There hangs this bellied pear let no rake doubtMeat for the tongue and febrile to the skinWasting for the mildew and the rot A tallow rump slow rounded a pelt thinAnd for the quickest bite so orchard bredHeaviest downward from the shaking stem Whose fingers curve around the ripened headLust to split so fine a diadem There is the picker stretches for the knifeThere are the ravening who claw the fruitMore those adjuring wax that lasts a lifeAnd foxes freak for cunning after loot For that sweet suck the hornet whines his wits But husbandman will dry her for the pits December 1951
