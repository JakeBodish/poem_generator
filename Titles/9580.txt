Vivid and heavy he strolls through dark brick kitchens
Within the great house of Esterhazy
A deaf servant’s candle
Is tipped toward bakers who are quarreling about
The green kindling The wassail is
Being made by pouring beer and sherry from dusty bottles
Over thirty baked apples in a large bowl into
The wassail young girls empty their aprons of
Cinnamon ground mace and allspice berries  A cook adds
Egg whites and brandy  The giant glass snifters
On a silver tray are taken from the kitchen by two maids 
The anxious pianist eats the edges of a fig
Stuffed with Devonshire cream  In the sinks the gallbladders
Of geese are soaking in cold salted water 
Walking in the storm this evening he passed
Children in rags singing carols they were roped together
In the drifting snow outside the palace gate 
He knew he would remember those boys’ faces     
There’s a procession into the kitchens larger boys each
With a heavy shoe of coal  The pianist sits and looks
Hard at a long black sausage  He will not eat
Before playing the new sonata  Beside him
The table sags with hams kidney pies and two shoulders
Of lamb  A hand rings a bell in the parlor
No longer able to hide he walks
Straight into the large room that blinds him with light 
He sits before the piano still thinking of hulled berries     
The simple sonata which
He is playing has little
To do with what he’s feeling something larger
Where a viola builds in air an infinite staircase 
An oboe joins the viola they struggle
For a more florid harmony    
But the silent violins now emerge
And like the big wing of a bird smother everything
In a darkness from which only a single horn escapes 
That feels effaced by the composer’s dream     
But he is not dreaming
The composer is finishing two performances simultaneously
He is back in the dark kitchens sulking and counting
His few florins they have paid him
With a snuffbox that was pressed
With two diamonds in Holland
This century discovers quinine 
And the sketchbooks of a mad sad musician
Who threw a lantern at his landlord who was standing beside
A critic  He screamed Here take the snuffbox I’ve filled
It with the dander of dragons
