
The world had fled with all its silly caresand questionable aches and in one swoonwe rose above its stupefying airslike flying lovesick pigs up to the moon      In that blue light where two lives equaled all     our souls looked down upon a spinning ball The world returned and this was a surpriseI raged against like someone on a racktelling the sun tears clouding my stunned eyesgive us our splendid isolation back      I craved third rails a shot of something strong     when I found out it doesn’t last for long The world came back and stayed pain never endedbut when the aches and cares begged for a handgrew softer in the light we’d made and tendedI finally began to understand    love’s widening third stage and of the three    this was the most outstanding ecstasy
