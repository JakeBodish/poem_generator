
In the moonlight
I met Berserk
In the moonlight
On the bushy plain 
 
Oh sharp he was
As the sleepless
 
And “Why are you red
In this milky blue”
I said 
“Why sun-colored
As if awake
In the midst of sleep”
 
“You that wander”
So he said
“On the bushy plain
Forget so soon 
But I set my traps
In the midst of dreams ”
 
I knew from this
That the blue ground
Was full of blocks
And blocking steel 
I knew the dread
Of the bushy plain
And the beauty
Of the moonlight
Falling there
Falling
As sleep falls
In the innocent air
