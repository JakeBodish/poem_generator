
I would have come 
When you called  But 
I had the most beautiful pale pink rose 
Its healthy stem was clenched between my teeth  And 
Its thorns bit sharply into my tender wet flesh  So 
 
I couldnt answer you  Still 
My lips moved at you silently 
They offered words you never heard 
They screamed inside my crazed brain  Only 
It could do nothing for you 
 
In time the petals wilted 
They blew away  And 
They became compost in someone elses garden 
The tough fibrous stem withered 
I bit down hard to snap its grip on me  Then 
 
My teeth fell out 
Its thorns had burrowed into my cheeks 
They had implanted themselves permanently 
They were suckling on my softest tissues  And 
Not long after they sprouted tiny shoots 
 
They coiled their way down 
I still held the memory of your call  And 
The long stemmed beauty lodged next to it 
They cleaved unto the long roots curling down my neck 
My body held tight and listened  Hard
