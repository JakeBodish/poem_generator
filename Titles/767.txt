
The storm was headed in our direction 
big loom of gray like the absolute West
leaned over us  Reports of damage
in the neighboring counties a silo unfurled
and took wing a house trailer
twisted loose  On the Doppler screen
the storm looked alive yellow and green
at the fringes with a fierce red heart
trending to violet  Sirens swept over
to scare it away like songbirds
grow strident circle and bluff
at the sight of an owl 
When the rain came in sheets
I regretted my sins  When lightning
cracked the red pines half-rotted heart
I wished the world more joy
in general  When the worst was over
and the grass lay flat but alive
and the sky was a waning bruise
I thought of that silo how it wasnt mine
and all that grain cast back into the worlds
wind maybe some of it still flying
