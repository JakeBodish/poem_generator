
You said I will pull you out of my body in 237
ways  What you wanted was beautifully to
sever things  Here love the same things  changed 
 
Finally a taxonomy of afterthoughts  As though
you were the one who was
sleeping  Breathing in the marrow of would 
 
You who are a valley of no I hear the music leaking  How she 
How she  How I  You say low key and I do not believe you 
I forgive everything the perseveration of skin 
 
My hands that are a chopping block and I
cannot touch him  I cannot touch him
without not touching me 
 
Because if you leave and you are already leaving there are three 
But you say less than three  And the couch in your absence
is crenellated  And who is going to watch us as we leave 
 
To add to the list of changing things life preservers are no longer
about preservation  They have become less holy  P F D 
personal flotation device  Endlessly possible  Unlike wood 
 
Stacey May Fowles wants a lover who will hit her 
I do not believe in submission  I want you to erase me 
This is a kindness  A kindness you tell me  A kindness I do not deserve 
 
On the floor  By the bed  Hotel Congress  March 19 2005 
Room 23  We are a long way from disintegrated  You said Now  Look at me  And I did  And you bloomed 
 
When my mother died I will say 
Many years after my mother has died 
But I will not believe her  Ill be like my grandmother who
 
despite my parade of girlfriends and her profession
that nobody should be mean to them stilldoesnt believe in being queer 
 I dont believe in being dead
Ill tell my dead mother  And just like you
shell repeat herself  Happy New Year  Happy New Year  Happy New 
 
I expect there will be a morning when you walk up to this very gate
while I am sitting here  I know this  I know you less each time I see you 
 I know this like I know you are more lonely than glass 
 
To your languishing  To your bubbly 
To your recent  To your hologram  To your desperately 
To your seeking  To your dictaphone  To your you 
 
Neuromuscular facilitation is just another way of saying
Vancouver  Always is yet a matter of roller derby  Just
in love with you  You more than sleep 
 
In the top drawer is a photograph of them touching 
It is not so much that it is a photograph 
It is that it is a depiction of what  not could 
 
I want to tell you about my body  About testosterone
as unwitting art historian  About recovery  Men  What it feels like
underneath there  The part you cannot know  but should 
 
Either way  Its a house  Its a house
like everyone else has  I take things away 
I dont take them for good 
 
How delirious must we sound when we are falling I miss you you cant even imagine  And how bad
at math  Less than three  Less than three  Less than three 
 
And what if  I completely remember
it wrong  What if I remember there were two
of us  And then what if  there was only one death 
 
I do not believe in the existence of holes
that lead to nowhere  Muscle memory remains an enigma  Still you can
touch her  You cannot touch her without not touching me 
 
And still you are not not a part of me  The world is
uncharacteristically unresponsive 
I could thank you  You stay with me  like grass
