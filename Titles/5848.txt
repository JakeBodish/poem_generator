
Here I am blowing this little streamof blue vapor into your parted lips Here I am placing my hands on your chestin an X while my red nails distractthe crowd of impostor lifeguardsclosing in  Here is the place to raisethe tent I can feel it in my bones The snake has perfected his skin he isready to be lifted and passed  Howdid I do it The process was messyI’d rather not share it but look lookat us now  Lemon drops and cherry bombs It’s the eye of the tiger went the songI used to sing in the basement alone
