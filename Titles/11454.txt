1 ClovenCloven Divided  About the title  The book Crowds and Power Masse und Macht 1960 translated from German was written by Elias Canetti it is a study of how crowd behavior ranging from religious congregations to mob violence relates to obedience to state rule  Canetti 1905-1994 was a Bulgarian born novelist playwright and non-fiction writer who wrote in German and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981  The second section of this poem in italics is a long quotationtranslation from this book we are incorporateincorporate United in one body  Compare part of one petition from the Book of Common Prayer “and that we are very members incorporate in the mystical body of thy Son” from The Order for the Administration of The Lord’s Supper or Holy Communion  our wounds simple but mysterious  We have some wherewithal to bide our time on earth  Endurance is fantasticFantastic Imaginative or fanciful remote from reality  ambulances battling at intersections the city intolerably en fêteen fête French for being festive perhaps being dressed in festive attire  My reflexes are words themselves rather than standard flexuresflexures Acts of bending such as bowing or kneeling of civil power  In all of this CassiopeiasCassiopeia’s Cassiopeia is both a star constellation in the northern sky and in Greek mythology an Ethiopian queen and the mother of Andromeda a beautiful woman but whose vanity and arrogance led to her downfall  John Milton refers to Cassiopeia in Il Penseroso “Or that starr’d Ethiop queen that strove  To set her beauty’s praise above  The sea nymphs and their powers offended” lines 19-21  a blessing as is steady OrionOrion Orion is both the easily recognized star constellation and in Greek mythology a hunter  beloved of poetsbeloved of poets A list of poems naming Orion includes Milton’s Paradise Lost Tennyson’s Locksley Hall Teasdale’s “Winter Stars”  Pickthall’s “Stars”  Eliot’s “Sweeney among the Nightingales”  and Frost’s “The Star-splitter ”   QuotidianQuotidian Daily everyday natures ours for the time being I do not know how we should be absolvedAbsolved To declare someone free from blame guilt or responsibility also in Christian theology to remit or forgive someone for a sin  or what is fate  2 Fame is not fastidious about the lipsFame is not fastidious about the lips In A Treatise of Civil Power 2007 Geoffrey Hill notes “section 2 is a paragraph from Elias Canetti’s chapter on ‘Fame’ transposed with slight changes of wording into strophic form ” For more on this book by Canetti see the note about the title above  which spread it  So long as there are mouths to reiterate the one name it does not matter whose they are  The fact that to the seeker after fame they are indistinguishable from each other and are all counted as equal shows that this passion has its origin in the experience of crowd manipulation  Names collect their own crowds  They are greedy live their own separate lives hardly at all connected with the real natures of the men who bear them  3 But hear this that which is difficult preserves democracy you pay respect to the intelligence of the citizen  Basics are not condescension  Some tyrants make great patrons  Let us observe this and pass on  Certain directives parody at your own risk  Tread lightly with personal dignity and public image  Safeguard the image of the common manthe common man There is another version of this poem printed in Geoffrey Hill’s book A Treatise of Civil Power 2007 with a fourth section added
