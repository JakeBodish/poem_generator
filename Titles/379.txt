
As the father turns away from the thought
of his failure the hands remove
his glasses and rub his eyes over
 
and over drying the nonexistent tears 
Unknown to the one who is troubled
about losing his hair his fingers stroke
 
his baldness as he speaks  The body
our constant companion understands
the loneliness of the hostess in her dark
 
driveway embracing herself after the guests
who promised more and soon have gone
and even visits the old schoolteacher
 
who reads the same happy ending to each
new class working her toes in her shoes 
How could the people of the kingdom
 
not have known the curse of sorrow
was nothing more than a long sleep
they had only to wake from In dreams
 
the body which longs for transformation
too suddenly lifts us above the dark
roofs of our houses and far above
 
the streets of the town until they seem
like any other small things fastened to earth
