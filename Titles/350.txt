
It is not pain that holds me back but time
With its sad prefigurations and smell­­­
Its flowers and echoes rivers and crime 
Even now without a future I tell
Myself lies in future tense  As my hair
Thins I collect combs  When clocks chime I groan 
The falling world finds pleasure in despair
Because to suffer means to be alone
And I suffer through all the accidents
Of change as though I were settling a score
As if to disinvent what death invents 
I once built a castle now I do chores 
To pass the time I rearrange my things 
To fall asleep I recite names of kings
