
I went to the city some days
to learn my masters pleasure
 laid fort at the farthest place
where hedges are highest
 terror of the obvious
is a rosary of similitude
Did you see some of the nudging
How did you feel about the nudging
Boats by water and wagons by land
in active assistance in perpetuating
fraudulent froth  hence
with haste Ive seen
their mulchy tongues
suck up every animate aim
sweeping excess into piles
the reserves and neocons
administrators and representatives
the preachers and deputies
and yahoos and spodies
In the evenings they come down
from their operational sectors
to kiss the children
what terror is in them
to keep the sugar boiling
to restrain the wanderings
as fragile and fictitious
Did you see the tent on a stick
Did you see the architecture of gathering
I go to the city some days
to gather whats left of scrubgrass
There in the alley we converse
Idris his love of fresh skim
Ted his disdain for women
their lack of banking
Terrence and Will their concern
for purity of pussy
power precedes them
sap-drenched
 parceled
across the land
I go to the city some days I receive a letter
Dear Comrades
dont get it twisted
never lick the hand that lashes you
use beef when you run out of oakum
