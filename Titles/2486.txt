
Where is the word I want
Groping
in the thicket
about to pinch the
dangling
berry my fingerpads
close on
air 
I can hear it
scrabbling like a squirrel
on the oaks far side 
 
Word please send over this black stretch of ocean
your singular flare
blaze
your topaz in the minds blank 
I could always pull the gift
from the lucky-dip barrel
scoop the right jewel
from my dragons trove    
Now I flail
the wrong item creaks up
on the mental dumbwaiter 
No use 
its turning
out of sight
a bicycle down a
Venetian alley 
I clatter after only to find
gondolas bobbing in sunny silence
a pigeon mumbling something
I just cant catch
