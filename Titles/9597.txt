
1    There are few probabilities through
      Which dreamers do not pass     
      The first dream
      Is the bright red dream
      Of our mother’s heart 
      It is her sacrifice
      Of something eternal
      In herself for us 
      The Arabs say
      Blood has flowed
      Let us begin again 
      The heart is like a cup or a coffer
      or a cave  It holds the image of the
      sun within us  It is a center of illumination
      and happiness and wisdom  To dream
      of the heart is always to dream of
      the importance of love     
      The second dream is the inauguration
      Of the soul  In this dream we are
      Confronted by a host of birds     
      Some were guileless
      Like the doves
