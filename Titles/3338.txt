
I love  Wouldnt we all like to start
a poem with I love       I would 
I mean I love the fact there are parallel lines
in the word parallel love how
words sometimes mirror what they mean 
I love mirrors and that stupid tale
about Narcissus  I suppose
there is some Narcissism in that 
You know Narcissism what you
remind me to avoid almost all the time  
Yeah I love Narcissism  I do  
But what I really love is ice cream  
Remember how I told you
no amount of ice cream can survive
a week in my freezer  You didnt believe me
did you No you didnt  But you know now
how true that is  I love
that you know my Achilles heel
is none other than ice cream 
so chilly so common 
And I love fountain pens  I mean
I just love them  Cleaning them 
filling them with ink fills me
with a kind of joy even if joy 
is so 1950  I know no one talks about
joy anymore  It is even more taboo 
than love  And so of course I love joy  
I love the way joy sounds as it exits
your mouth  You know the word joy 
How joyous is that  It makes me think
of bubbles chandeliers dandelions 
I love the way the mind runs
that pathway from bubbles to dandelions 
Yes I love a lot  And right here
walking down this street 
I love the way we make
a bridge a suspension bridge
 almost as beautiful as the
Golden Gate Bridge swaying
as we walk hand in hand
