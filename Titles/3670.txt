I watch them line up ark-like two by two chatting quietly and
after the teacher passes one pushes and the one pushed begins
the chase  This is how the orphans marched through Warsaw in 42
I tell the behaved ones orderly and under orders  And Im about to
begin that horrific story the one they dont yet know when I pause
to open the door for a little air  And there they are again arms akimbo
like two stooges the Angel of Death and the Angel of Forgetfulness
those vaudeville comics those incorrigible face-making kids
stuck forever you first no you in the undersized doorframe
of the museum I will for lack of a better word call childhood 
II 
Did I say Angels Clearly I meant my great-aunts whom you havent
yet met  My sister called them From-This-You-Shouldnt-Know 
and May-You-Never-Forget  I preferred Horseradish and Charoset
that bittersweet matzoh sandwich munched at Pesach between prayers 
Everyone I knew was still alive and no one cared that in Venice
that very summer Ginsberg in the name of the Jews forgave Pound 
Hadnt Id forgone my own bar mitzvah for a weekend in Miami Beach
where that borscht-belt-south social director and shuffleboard champ
first shticked Theres Noah business like Shoah business soon after
Lillian Hellman ushered her de-judaicized Anne Frank onto the stage 
III 
Are you writing another Holocaust poem my son asks 
Hes gauging my anger at this interruption a love sonnet
less so but it takes eight dollars of gas just to get to his
summer job  To Hell with the poem I need me some shekels
he sings misquoting both Ravikovitch and Snoop Dogg  Poetry
was nowhere in my fathers house or money either our doorposts
marked pass-over although in a pinch Dad could recite Kiplings
Gunga Din  Make fun if you must my mother says but look in
the mirror and Im here to tell you that your father was a better man
than all those anti-Semitic Pounds and Eliots rolled up into one 
IV 
That was twenty-three years ago before my mother cradling
his neck and not yet crying waited while in East New York
the ambulance raced and the Angel of Death loitered 
Are you comfortable she asks adjusting my fathers pillow
while he ever the emcee mimics Henny Youngmans I make
a living  Poetry makes nothing happen Auden might repeat
were he here and what wouldnt I give at this moment
for his stiff British upper lip  Whats one more death in the family
Otto Frank argues expunging not grief but sex from his daughters
diary and what parent today would dare to play jury or judge 
V 
Are you writing another Holocaust poem the Angel of Consciousness
who sits while I muse on my right shoulder and whom I often confuse
with her errant two-headed twin the Angel of Conscience asks 
And now Im recalling my home office the Akeidah above the desk
the knife blade drawn downward that Angel whats her name
restraining Abrahams implausibly blood-stained arm  And because
I exiled to the basement when my Isaac arrived overlooked
that drawing it hung ten months above my newborn sons head I feel wicked sleeping in this warm bed my daughter proclaims
rehearsing her Anne Frank and pausing anxiously for applause 
VI Burn everything after Im dead Kafka said poking his prewar
Jewish head into yet one more of my poems  Hes trying to explain
the fatherland to the fatherless  No one reads poetry anymore anyway
my mother quoting from her own unpublished diary writes  And who
doesnt want to go on living even after death
