I made myself  Mommy and Daddy were proud in that order 
I didn’t mail myself like a letter some other kids
already knew  I learned to use stamps  They stuck to my thumb
without any glue  I didn’t have any permission 
                                                 2
 
There was a snowstorm that lasted three days
and a cavern of monochrome memory  There were board games and a
      pencil-and-paper game
where the object was to figure out the object of the game 
There was a stack of broad-rule writing paper and a stapled calendar
and a 64-pack of sparkly rainbow crayons to make each week look different
since they all started out black and white and all the same

O grapefruit as color and flavor  O never quite rightly tied laces  O look
up there on the uneven climbing bars
too hot to touch where the sun touches now that it’s spring
 
the shadow of a tarp like a sail between sailors
and thin swings that make no decision like weathervanes 
 
O think of the lost Chuck Taylors  The lost Mary Janes
