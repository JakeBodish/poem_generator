Shut shut the door good John fatigud I said Tie up the knocker say Im sick Im dead  The dog-star rages nay tis past a doubt All Bedlam or Parnassus is let out Fire in each eye and papers in each hand They rave recite and madden round the land         What walls can guard me or what shades can hide They pierce my thickets through my grot they glide By land by water they renew the charge They stop the chariot and they board the barge  No place is sacred not the church is free Evn Sunday shines no Sabbath-day to me Then from the Mint walks forth the man of rhyme Happy to catch me just at dinner-time         Is there a parson much bemusd in beer A maudlin poetess a rhyming peer A clerk foredoomd his fathers soul to cross Who pens a stanza when he should engross Is there who lockd from ink and paper scrawls With desprate charcoal round his darkend walls All fly to Twitnam and in humble strain Apply to me to keep them mad or vain  Arthur whose giddy son neglects the laws Imputes to me and my damnd works the cause Poor Cornus sees his frantic wife elope And curses wit and poetry and Pope         Friend to my life which did not you prolong The world had wanted many an idle song What drop or nostrum can this plague remove Or which must end me a fools wrath or love A dire dilemma either way Im sped If foes they write if friends they read me dead  Seizd and tied down to judge how wretched I Who cant be silent and who will not lie To laugh were want of goodness and of grace And to be grave exceeds all powr of face  I sit with sad civility I read With honest anguish and an aching head And drop at last but in unwilling ears This saving counsel Keep your piece nine years         Nine years cries he who high in Drury-lane Lulld by soft zephyrs through the broken pane Rhymes ere he wakes and prints before Term ends Obligd by hunger and request of friends The piece you think is incorrect why take it Im all submission what youd have it make it         Three things anothers modest wishes bound My friendship and a prologue and ten pound         Pitholeon sends to me You know his Grace I want a patron ask him for a place         Pitholeon libelld me but heres a letter Informs you sir twas when he knew no better  Dare you refuse him Curll invites to dine Hell write a Journal or hell turn Divine         Bless me a packet Tis a stranger sues A virgin tragedy an orphan muse  If I dislike it Furies death and rage If I approve Commend it to the stage  There thank my stars my whole commission ends The playrs and I are luckily no friends  Fird that the house reject him Sdeath Ill print it And shame the fools your intrest sir with Lintot Lintot dull rogue will think your price too much  Not sir if you revise it and retouch  All my demurs but double his attacks At last he whispers Do and we go snacks  Glad of a quarrel straight I clap the door Sir let me see your works and you no more         Tis sung when Midas ears began to spring Midas a sacred person and a king His very minister who spied them first Some say his queen was forcd to speak or burst  And is not mine my friend a sorer case When evry coxcomb perks them in my face        Good friend forbear you deal in dangrous things  Id never name queens ministers or kings Keep close to ears and those let asses prick Tis nothing Nothing if they bite and kick Out with it  Dunciad let the secret pass That secret to each fool that hes an ass The truth once told and wherefore should we lie The queen of Midas slept and so may I         You think this cruel take it for a rule No creature smarts so little as a fool  Let peals of laughter Codrus round thee break Thou unconcernd canst hear the mighty crack Pit box and gallry in convulsions hurld Thou standst unshook amidst a bursting world  Who shames a scribbler break one cobweb through He spins the slight self-pleasing thread anew Destroy his fib or sophistry in vain The creatures at his dirty work again Thrond in the centre of his thin designs Proud of a vast extent of flimsy lines Whom have I hurt has poet yet or peer Lost the archd eye-brow or Parnassian sneer And has not Colley still his lord and whore His butchers Henley his Free-masons Moore Does not one table Bavius still admit Still to one bishop Philips seem a wit Still Sappho  Hold for God-sake youll offend No names be calm learn prudence of a friend I too could write and I am twice as tall But foes like these One flattrers worse than all  Of all mad creatures if the learnd are right It is the slaver kills and not the bite  A fool quite angry is quite innocent Alas tis ten times worse when they repent         One dedicates in high heroic prose And ridicules beyond a hundred foes One from all Grub Street will my fame defend And more abusive calls himself my friend  This prints my Letters that expects a bribe And others roar aloud Subscribe subscribe         There are who to my person pay their court I cough like Horace and though lean am short Ammons great son one shoulder had too high Such Ovids nose and Sir you have an eye  Go on obliging creatures make me see All that disgracd my betters met in me Say for my comfort languishing in bed Just so immortal Maro held his head And when I die be sure you let me know Great Homer died three thousand years ago         Why did I write what sin to me unknown Dippd me in ink my parents or my own As yet a child nor yet a fool to fame I lispd in numbers for the numbers came  I left no calling for this idle trade No duty broke no father disobeyd  The Muse but servd to ease some friend not wife To help me through this long disease my life To second Arbuthnot thy art and care And teach the being you preservd to bear         But why then publish Granville the polite And knowing Walsh would tell me I could write Well-naturd Garth inflamed with early praise And Congreve lovd and Swift endurd my lays The courtly Talbot Somers Sheffield read Evn mitred Rochester would nod the head And St  Johns self great Drydens friends before With open arms receivd one poet more  Happy my studies when by these approvd Happier their author when by these belovd From these the world will judge of men and books Not from the Burnets Oldmixons and Cookes         Soft were my numbers who could take offence While pure description held the place of sense Like gentle Fannys was my flowry theme A painted mistress or a purling stream  Yet then did Gildon draw his venal quill I wishd the man a dinner and sat still  Yet then did Dennis rave in furious fret I never answerd I was not in debt  If want provokd or madness made them print I wagd no war with Bedlam or the Mint         Did some more sober critic come abroad If wrong I smild if right I kissd the rod  Pains reading study are their just pretence And all they want is spirit taste and sense  Commas and points they set exactly right And twere a sin to rob them of their mite  Yet neer one sprig of laurel gracd these ribalds From slashing Bentley down to pidling Tibbalds  Each wight who reads not and but scans and spells Each word-catcher that lives on syllables Evn such small critics some regard may claim Preservd in Miltons or in Shakespeares name  Pretty in amber to observe the forms Of hairs or straws or dirt or grubs or worms The things we know are neither rich nor rare But wonder how the devil they got there        Were others angry I excusd them too Well might they rage I gave them but their due  A mans true merit tis not hard to find But each mans secret standard in his mind That casting weight pride adds to emptiness This who can gratify for who can guess The bard whom pilferd pastorals renown Who turns a Persian tale for half a crown Just writes to make his barrenness appear And strains from hard-bound brains eight lines a year He who still wanting though he lives on theft Steals much spends little yet has nothing left And he who now to sense now nonsense leaning Means not but blunders round about a meaning And he whose fustians so sublimely bad It is not poetry but prose run mad All these my modest satire bade translate And ownd that nine such poets made a Tate  How did they fume and stamp and roar and chafe And swear not Addison himself was safe         Peace to all such but were there one whose fires True genius kindles and fair fame inspires Blest with each talent and each art to please And born to write converse and live with ease Should such a man too fond to rule alone Bear like the Turk no brother near the throne View him with scornful yet with jealous eyes And hate for arts that causd himself to rise Damn with faint praise assent with civil leer And without sneering teach the rest to sneer Willing to wound and yet afraid to strike Just hint a fault and hesitate dislike Alike reservd to blame or to commend A timrous foe and a suspicious friend Dreading evn fools by flatterers besiegd And so obliging that he neer obligd Like Cato give his little senate laws And sit attentive to his own applause While wits and templars evry sentence raise And wonder with a foolish face of praise  Who but must laugh if such a man there be Who would not weep if Atticus were he        What though my name stood rubric on the walls Or plaisterd posts with claps in capitals Or smoking forth a hundred hawkers load On wings of winds came flying all abroad I sought no homage from the race that write I kept like Asian monarchs from their sight Poems I heeded now berhymd so long No more than thou great George a birthday song  I neer with wits or witlings passd my days To spread about the itch of verse and praise Nor like a puppy daggled through the town To fetch and carry sing-song up and down Nor at rehearsals sweat and mouthd and cried With handkerchief and orange at my side But sick of fops and poetry and prate To Bufo left the whole Castalian state         Proud as Apollo on his forked hill Sat full-blown Bufo puffd by every quill Fed with soft dedication all day long Horace and he went hand in hand in song  His library where busts of poets dead And a true Pindar stood without a head Receivd of wits an undistinguishd race Who first his judgment askd and then a place Much they extolld his pictures much his seat And flatterd evry day and some days eat Till grown more frugal in his riper days He paid some bards with port and some with praise To some a dry rehearsal was assignd And others harder still he paid in kind  Dryden alone what wonder came not nigh Dryden alone escapd this judging eye But still the great have kindness in reserve He helpd to bury whom he helpd to starve         May some choice patron bless each grey goose quill May evry Bavius have his Bufo still So when a statesman wants a days defence Or envy holds a whole weeks war with sense Or simple pride for flattry makes demands May dunce by dunce be whistled off my hands Blest be the great for those they take away And those they left me for they left me Gay Left me to see neglected genius bloom Neglected die and tell it on his tomb Of all thy blameless life the sole return My verse and Queensbry weeping oer thy urn        Oh let me live my own and die so too To live and die is all I have to do Maintain a poets dignity and ease And see what friends and read what books I please  Above a patron though I condescend Sometimes to call a minister my friend I was not born for courts or great affairs I pay my debts believe and say my prayrs Can sleep without a poem in my head Nor know if Dennis be alive or dead         Why am I askd what next shall see the light Heavns was I born for nothing but to write Has life no joys for me or to be grave Have I no friend to serve no soul to save I found him close with Swift Indeed no doubt Cries prating Balbus something will come out  Tis all in vain deny it as I will  No such a genius never can lie still And then for mine obligingly mistakes The first lampoon Sir Will  or Bubo makes  Poor guiltless I and can I choose but smile When evry coxcomb knows me by my style        Cursd be the verse how well soeer it flow That tends to make one worthy man my foe Give virtue scandal innocence a fear Or from the soft-eyd virgin steal a tear But he who hurts a harmless neighbours peace Insults falln worth or beauty in distress Who loves a lie lame slander helps about Who writes a libel or who copies out That fop whose pride affects a patrons name Yet absent wounds an authors honest fame Who can your merit selfishly approve And show the sense of it without the love Who has the vanity to call you friend Yet wants the honour injurd to defend Who tells whater you think whateer you say And if he lie not must at least betray Who to the Dean and silver bell can swear And sees at Cannons what was never there Who reads but with a lust to misapply Make satire a lampoon and fiction lie  A lash like mine no honest man shall dread But all such babbling blockheads in his stead         Let Sporus tremble What that thing of silk Sporus that mere white curd of asss milk Satire or sense alas can Sporus feel Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel Yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings This painted child of dirt that stinks and stings Whose buzz the witty and the fair annoys Yet wit neer tastes and beauty ner enjoys So well-bred spaniels civilly delight In mumbling of the game they dare not bite  Eternal smiles his emptiness betray As shallow streams run dimpling all the way  Whether in florid impotence he speaks And as the prompter breathes the puppet squeaks Or at the ear of Eve familiar toad Half froth half venom spits himself abroad In puns or politics or tales or lies Or spite or smut or rhymes or blasphemies  His wit all see-saw between  that and  this  Now high now low now Master up now Miss And he himself one vile antithesis  Amphibious thing that acting either part The trifling head or the corrupted heart Fop at the toilet flattrer at the board Now trips a lady and now struts a lord  Eves tempter thus the rabbins have expressd A cherubs face a reptile all the rest Beauty that shocks you parts that none will trust Wit that can creep and pride that licks the dust         Not fortunes worshipper nor fashions fool Not lucres madman nor ambitions tool Not proud nor servile be one poets praise That if he pleasd he pleasd by manly ways That flattry even to kings he held a shame And thought a lie in verse or prose the same That not in fancys maze he wanderd long But stoopd to truth and moralizd his song That not for fame but virtues better end He stood the furious foe the timid friend The damning critic half-approving wit The coxcomb hit or fearing to be hit Laughd at the loss of friends he never had The dull the proud the wicked and the mad The distant threats of vengeance on his head The blow unfelt the tear he never shed The tale revivd the lie so oft oerthrown Th imputed trash and dulness not his own The morals blackend when the writings scape The libelld person and the picturd shape Abuse on all he lovd or lovd him spread A friend in exile or a father dead The whisper that to greatness still too near Perhaps yet vibrates on his sovereigns ear  Welcome for thee fair Virtue all the past For thee fair Virtue welcome evn the last        But why insult the poor affront the great A knaves a knave to me in evry state Alike my scorn if he succeed or fail Sporus at court or Japhet in a jail A hireling scribbler or a hireling peer Knight of the post corrupt or of the shire If on a pillory or near a throne He gain his princes ear or lose his own         Yet soft by nature more a dupe than wit Sappho can tell you how this man was bit This dreaded satrist Dennis will confess Foe to his pride but friend to his distress So humble he has knockd at Tibbalds door Has drunk with Cibber nay has rhymd for Moore  Full ten years slanderd did he once reply Three thousand suns went down on Welsteds lie  To please a mistress one aspersd his life He lashd him not but let her be his wife  Let Budgell charge low Grub Street on his quill And write whateer he pleasd except his will Let the two Curlls of town and court abuse His father mother body soul and muse  Yet why that father held it for a rule It was a sin to call our neighbour fool That harmless mother thought no wife a whore  Hear this and spare his family James Moore Unspotted names and memorable long If there be force in virtue or in song         Of gentle blood part shed in honours cause While yet in Britain honour had applause Each parent sprung What fortune pray Their own And better got than Bestias from the throne  Born to no pride inheriting no strife Nor marrying discord in a noble wife Stranger to civil and religious rage The good man walkd innoxious through his age  No courts he saw no suits would ever try Nor dard an oath nor hazarded a lie Un-learnd he knew no schoolmans subtle art No language but the language of the heart  By nature honest by experience wise Healthy by temprance and by exercise His life though long to sickness past unknown His death was instant and without a groan  O grant me thus to live and thus to die Who sprung from kings shall know less joy than I         O friend may each domestic bliss be thine Be no unpleasing melancholy mine Me let the tender office long engage To rock the cradle of reposing age With lenient arts extend a mothers breath Make langour smile and smooth the bed of death Explore the thought explain the asking eye And keep a while one parent from the sky On cares like these if length of days attend May Heavn to bless those days preserve my friend Preserve him social cheerful and serene And just as rich as when he servd a queen  Whether that blessing be denied or givn Thus far was right the rest belongs to Heavn
