people go Gazing where the lilies blow Round an island there below        The island of Shalott  Willows whiten aspens quiver Little breezes dusk and shiver Thro the wave that runs for ever By the island in the river        Flowing down to Camelot  Four gray walls and four gray towers Overlook a space of flowers And the silent isle imbowers        The Lady of Shalott  By the margin willow veild Slide the heavy barges traild By slow horses and unhaild The shallop flitteth silken-saild        Skimming down to Camelot But who hath seen her wave her hand Or at the casement seen her stand Or is she known in all the land        The Lady of Shalott Only reapers reaping early In among the bearded barley Hear a song that echoes cheerly From the river winding clearly        Down to towerd Camelot And by the moon the reaper weary Piling sheaves in uplands airy Listening whispers  Tis the fairy        Lady of Shalott  Part II There she weaves by night and day A magic web with colours gay  She has heard a whisper say A curse is on her if she stay        To look down to Camelot  She knows not what the curse may be And so she weaveth steadily And little other care hath she        The Lady of Shalott  And moving thro a mirror clear That hangs before her all the year Shadows of the world appear  There she sees the highway near        Winding down to Camelot There the river eddy whirls And there the surly village-churls And the red cloaks of market girls        Pass onward from Shalott  Sometimes a troop of damsels glad An abbot on an ambling pad Sometimes a curly shepherd-lad Or long-haird page in crimson clad        Goes by to towerd Camelot And sometimes thro the mirror blue The knights come riding two and two She hath no loyal knight and true        The Lady of Shalott  But in her web she still delights To weave the mirrors magic sights For often thro the silent nights A funeral with plumes and lights        And music went to Camelot Or when the moon was overhead Came two young lovers lately wed I am half sick of shadows said        The Lady of Shalott  Part III A bow-shot from her bower-eaves He rode between the barley-sheaves The sun came dazzling thro the leaves And flamed upon the brazen greaves        Of bold Sir Lancelot  A red-cross knight for ever kneeld To a lady in his shield That sparkled on the yellow field        Beside remote Shalott  The gemmy bridle glitterd free Like to some branch of stars we see Hung in the golden Galaxy  The bridle bells rang merrily        As he rode down to Camelot And from his blazond baldric slung A mighty silver bugle hung And as he rode his armour rung        Beside remote Shalott  All in the blue unclouded weather Thick-jewelld shone the saddle-leather The helmet and the helmet-feather Burnd like one burning flame together        As he rode down to Camelot  As often thro the purple night Below the starry clusters bright Some bearded meteor trailing light        Moves over still Shalott  His broad clear brow in sunlight glowd On burnishd hooves his war-horse trode From underneath his helmet flowd His coal-black curls as on he rode        As he rode down to Camelot  From the bank and from the river He flashd into the crystal mirror Tirra lirra by the river        Sang Sir Lancelot  She left the web she left the loom She made three paces thro the room She saw the water-lily bloom She saw the helmet and the plume        She lookd down to Camelot  Out flew the web and floated wide The mirror crackd from side to side The curse is come upon me cried        The Lady of Shalott  Part IV In the stormy east-wind straining The pale yellow woods were waning The broad stream in his banks complaining Heavily the low sky raining        Over towerd Camelot Down she came and found a boat Beneath a willow left afloat And round about the prow she wrote        The Lady of Shalott  And down the rivers dim expanse Like some bold seër in a trance Seeing all his own mischance  With a glassy countenance        Did she look to Camelot  And at the closing of the day She loosed the chain and down she lay The broad stream bore her far away        The Lady of Shalott  Lying robed in snowy white That loosely flew to left and right  The leaves upon her falling light  Thro the noises of the night        She floated down to Camelot And as the boat-head wound along The willowy hills and fields among They heard her singing her last song        The Lady of Shalott  Heard a carol mournful holy Chanted loudly chanted lowly Till her blood was frozen slowly And her eyes were darkend wholly        Turnd to towerd Camelot  For ere she reachd upon the tide The first house by the water-side Singing in her song she died        The Lady of Shalott  Under tower and balcony By garden-wall and gallery A gleaming shape she floated by Dead-pale between the houses high        Silent into Camelot  Out upon the wharfs they came Knight and burgher lord and dame And round the prow they read her name        The Lady of Shalott  Who is this and what is here And in the lighted palace near Died the sound of royal cheer And they crossd themselves for fear        All the knights at Camelot But Lancelot mused a little space He said She has a lovely face God in his mercy lend her grace        The Lady of Shalott
