
The woman who cannot bring forth her child go to a dead man’s grave and then step three times over the grave and then say these words three times

This is my cure for the loathsome late-birth
This is my cure for the bitter black-birth
This is my cure for the loathsome imperfect-birth
 
And when that woman is with child and she goes to her lord in his bed then let her say

Up I go over you I step
with a quick child not a quelled one
with a full-born one not a doomed one 
 
And when the mother feels the child is quick go then to a church and when she comes before the altar say then

Christ I said it  This has been uttered 
 
The woman who cannot bring forth her child grasp a handful of her own child’s grave and after that bind it in black wool and sell it to peddlers and say then

I sell it you sell it 
This blackened wool this sorrow seed 
 
Translated from the Old English
