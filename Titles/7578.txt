
If things were worse this cursed rain
would soak me unto sickness
so Samuel Sewall might have
written in his vespers journal 
I have it on my writing desk
inside  For three days I have
labored with a saw and plane
and many boards to make my girl
a swingset near her mother’s
lilac shrubs as rain has drizzled
cold and meaningless  How
coherent was his world of works
and days when Plentifull Rains
might connote a coming
providence so Sewall notes
of Her Majesty’s Court June
the eighteenth seventeen twelve             We are well satisfyed with the Layin out
            of our Money
