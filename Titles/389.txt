
That sound Arvo Pärt does with one piano note
stars split fade wander
in cosmic expansion 
 
First responder’s genesis and torch of
metadatacrunch tumbling in a 
burnt and weedy churchyard
equal parts Lethe and lithe 
Grass is it hollow hallow
to wake no longer among
mortals The woman her dress flowered
from a blown ceiling silver-rosed 
Flat plasm’s
archangel coming clear out
of sheetrock and screen
shield and spear in hand
let us do all the cooking 
if she will lead the pack remember the route read the waters 
After the great fire we
tread river’s late cream and flare 
We woke in a city 
Where who slew us into portions
on a block out of earth
gathered our limbs 
and we were allowed to continue 
unhunted  If “if” is the one word one is given with God 
to explain how one survived 
Oh   Ah   Siren
white cockatoo
meets deep
blue  
Fog   Pour ammonia
on coyote 
scat
