Bridge’s absence gave the creek a new aspect 
Uncrossable irascible  Crosser stems
on the bank with her will and form
extension “Phantom of incapacity
which is me ” Bright roar of water
x of indomitability

The bridge is not an x  It bridges nothing 
The turmoil is only a portion

Bridge on the grass is brideless 
Tufts of terra like a bloom in air 
Rational slats a surface’s accretion
slat system  Grass tints it heliotropic
emanation sharp up or complex
occupation in shiving rain

Creek’s uncrossability a new beauty 
“It looked like the process of a thinking
deep run ” It became the suffering of form
and mute suggestion  The syllables
were not perennial  They broke and grew

The blue pants of the crosser were neither sky
nor water  They orient to the body
as form and boundary  The crosser’s green shirt
neither grass nor leaf-thought 
Desire to not get wet another hurt

“Glamour of limit where the rocks just slant”
down the bank in a wet
 
stratification and the creek
spills blows and goings
and is omniform leaving a prime of seem

High water as a contour of relation
swells hurls  The creek which was other
but not antipodal or refusal  “The wish
to touch it with my phenomenal hand”
loves it as material

The bridge made the force containable 
Bridgeless the crosser sits and very still 
“My phenomenal body crosses and longs ”
Ceaseless body of the audible
