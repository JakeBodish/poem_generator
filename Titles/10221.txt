
I was chasing this blue butterfly down
the road when a car came by and clipped me    
It was nothing serious but it angered me and
I turned around and cursed the driver who didnt
even slow down to see if I was hurt  Then I
returned my attention to the butterfly which   
was nowhere to be seen  One of the Doubleday   
girls came running up the street with her toy
poodle toward me  I stopped her and asked
Have you seen a blue butterfly around here
Its down near that birch tree near Grandpas
she said  Thanks I said and walked briskly
toward the tree  It was fluttering from flower
to flower in Mr  Doubledays extensive garden   
a celestial blueness to soothe the weary heart    
I didnt know what I was doing there  I certain-
ly didnt want to capture it  It was like
something I had known in another life even if
it was only in a dream I wanted to confirm it    
I was a blind beggar on the streets of Cordoba
when I first saw it and now again it was here
