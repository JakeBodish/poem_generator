
I drove through the narrow Gods 
privet and cholesterol or   
Irish creamery butter as the waiter
called it as it shaved another day   
off my life  There was no salt   
and antimony just lumpy roads
through Meath and Leitrim    
The sky was a show of flashing   
mirrors as day broke on Rosses 
Tide out and weed like cow pies   
on the shore  The punt down and   
the EEC on the horizon
as I read in the guidebook about pilgrims   
climbing St  Patrick’s barefoot   
every summer 
Out of the fog a man in Wranglers and   
spurred boots clean-shaven a cigarette   
in hand waved me down “Scrum faced house at the end of the bay ”   
“Hop in” I said  “You lookin’
for where John Wayne made
