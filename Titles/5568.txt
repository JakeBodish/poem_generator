I am not a woman Iam a man  Made in His image I keep the house a gray Cape Codand broom it well  I wear a skirt to becomfortable  I build the fire When my husband comes home I don’t pester Him with questions He knows where to find His slippers and His pipe Out our kitchen back door I see the prophets freight-hoppingthe long bad Western in ancient Englishthat no one need read to know  Everyone speaks his partthe women keep their heads downwhile the men are losing theirs  ChildrenHow often I’ve prayed for a child which meansslipping meaning looks to my husband as we rocktogether on the porch of an evening drinking lemonadeand playing Scrabble  If He lets me winit’s a sign  I haven’t won yet But the neighbor children come and goand take the pies cooling on the windowsillwithout thanks  Sometimes terrible thingshappen to them   some manspills the bloodcradled so carefully in every hand  I acceptno blame  The pies were there to leave aloneor not  God says nothingbut taps out His pipe stands with a handto ease His aching back  Time for bed Our bed is a rolling ocean that I tread alonejust a head bobbing above the ash-colored waveswhile the moon waits for me and everythingto drown to know again the peacethe moon knows the silence interrupted by astronautslittle green men the spectacle a mothercan’t help but make of  herself  Godcomes to bedand I clutch a spar a barrel an oarand ride out the night with it  When He fucks mestill He doesn’t speak for speech is creationbut I rock with him I roll insidewhat cannot be comprehended in force  I forgetthat I’m a man I forget the wild sea I let slipmy grasp and the colors I havethat cover me  Once I dreamedof the morning we left the house togetherin identical sober suits we stood in the streetand beheld the sad little town wreathed in black crepefor its children  As though the morningcould show me His face  He coughed And when I awokein our ordinary bed streaked by sun through leaded windows I heldmy baby to my breast and watched the roof  beamand whispered to her It’s all rightwe are safe only and always from our dreams
