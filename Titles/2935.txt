             with a ribbon and garlanded
                           flowers in hand 
The bark wont unravel
             the tree spells solidness we
                            grand oaken elmed selves
of the ancients  Our pith
            is clean  Theres no pining
                          away for tomorrow we are
in current respiration
            we move with the wind 
                          Singular we are
stunning  In horde
              we are dense differing
                            dream  The autumnal
flashiness these days
             is drought-determined 
                          We barely go beyond
the red  Our hollows
              are never vacant  We live
                             to board we take
the ax  Marbled inside
             the original stem  We were
                          born we dont know when
