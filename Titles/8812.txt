
Tropical nights in Central America
with moonlit lagoons and volcanoes
and lights from presidential palaces
barracks and sad curfew warnings 
Often while smoking a cigarette
Ive decided that a man should die
says Ubico smoking a cigarette      
In his pink-wedding-cake palace
Ubico has a head cold  Outside the people
were dispersed with phosphorous bombs 
San Salvador laden with night and espionage
with whispers in homes and boardinghouses
and screams in police stations 
Carías palace stoned by the people 
A window of his office has been smashed
and the police have fired upon the people 
And Managua the target of machine guns
from the chocolate-cookie palace
and steel helmets patrolling the streets Watchman What hour is it of the night
Watchman What hour is it of the night
