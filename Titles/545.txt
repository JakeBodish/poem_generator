
As I punch the time-clock I know
men will be gunned down at dawn
in a distant continent someone
will dart into a café with a bomb nestled
 
in the belly by the roadside a woman
will moan over the body of a man
shrunken stretched on the earth that God
will finger the forehead of a dying country
 
all of it funneled through the news on TV 
But tonight instead of tuning in I’m going to kneel
beside the window recognize myself
in the croak of the crow high above the black tree
 
of winter claws hooked and rough wings swept
back and hunched face masked with exhaust 
I’m going to try even if I fail to see myself whole
complete in the cry in the beak of the crow
