
Let me be in your service
like the others
mumbling predictions
mouth dry with jealousy 
Parched tongue
thirsting not even for the word 
for me the dry air is empty
again without you 
 
I’m not jealous any more
but I want you 
I carry myself like a victim
to the hangman 
I will not call you
either joy or love 
All my own blood is gone 
Something strange paces there now 
Another moment
and I will tell you
its not joy but torture
you give me 
Im drawn to you
as to a crime 
to your ragged mouth
to the soft bitten cherry 
Come back to me
Im frightened without you 
Never had you such power
over me as now 
Everything I desire
appears to me 
Im not jealous any more 
Im calling you
