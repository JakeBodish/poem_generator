
About what’s past Hold on when you can I used to sayAnd when you can’t let go as if memory were one of those
mechanical bulls easily dismountable should the ride
turn rough  I lived in those days at the forest’s edge   
metaphorically so it can sometimes seem now though
the forest was real as my life beside it was  I spent
much of my time listening to the sounds of random un-
knowable things dropping or being dropped from variously
a middling height or a great one until by winter it was
just the snow falling each time like a new unnecessary
taxonomy or syntax for how to parse what’s plain snow
from which the occasional lost hunter would emerge
every few or so seasons and   just once   a runaway child
whom I gave some money to and told no one about
having promised     You must keep what you’ve promised
very close to your heart that way you’ll never forget
