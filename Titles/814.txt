
A man celebrates erstwhile conquests
his book locked in a silo still in print 
 
I scribble make Sharpie lines deface
its text like it defaces me  Outside grain
 
fields whisper  Marble lions are silent
yet silver-tongued with excellent teeth 
 
In this life I have worshipped so many lies 
Then I workshop them make them better 
 
An East India Company an opium trade
a war a treaty a concession an occupation
 
a man parting the veil covering a woman’s
face his nails prying her lips open  I love
 
the fragility of a porcelain bowl  How easy
it is to shatter chinoiserie like the Han
 
dynasty urn Ai Weiwei dropped in 1995 
If only recovering the silenced history
 
is as simple as smashing its container book
bowl celadon spoon  Such objects cross
 
borders the way our bodies never could 
Instead we’re left with history its blonde
 
dust  That bowl is unbreakable  All its ghosts
still shudder through us like small breaths 
 
The tome of hegemony lives on circulates
in our libraries in our bloodstreams  One day
 
a girl like me may come across it on a shelf
pick it up read about all the ways her body
 
is a thing  And I won’t be there to protect
her to cross the text out and say go ahead rewrite this
