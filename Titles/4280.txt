Apá dying is boring  To pass las horasI carveour last nameall over my body 
I try to recall the taste of  Pablo’s sweat Whiskey no Wet dirt sí I stuff  Englishinto my mouth spit out chingaderas Have it your way Home of the Whopper Run
for the border  ¡Aguas The mirrorbetrayed us It erased your facefrom my face Gave me mother’s smile narrow nariz Once I woreher necklace The gold slick
obscene  God I was beautiful Cada nocheI sleepwith dead men The coyote was the third to die Your moneyis still in his wallet Quien engaña
no gana  Apá there’s a foto in my bolsilloof a skeletonshroudedin black flamesNuestra Señora de la Santa Muerte Patron saintof smugglers pick-pockets  jotos 
La Flaca  Señora Negra  La Huesuda ¡AguasAn animalis prowlingthis station  It shimmies with hunger It shimmerswith thirst To keep it away
I hurl my memories at it  Your laughter is nowsnaggedon its fangs Your painnow breathes inside its lungs  Tastethe feeling Siempre Coca-Cola America’s
real choice   I gathered  smashed bottles Apá followthe glasssnaking fromthe barrel to a mesquite to find my body Lips blueskin thickwith scabs 
Apá kneel in the shade peelthe scabs  Touchour last name Solís
