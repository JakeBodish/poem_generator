
The future is as sterile as a robot’s loincloth 
I drown my hands in sanitizer until they pucker 
 
Where this soapbox tree germinates I collect
my germs and make a fountain of them 
 
Because yellow is yarrow and soot and the future
I’ve learned is no suture  Because where I’m from
these kisses are infections  Because dirt’s
 
ammunition against discipline the blood fills
my clean mouth with dismay  Am I surprised 
Hollywood still assumes we are all the bastard
 
children of the same evil dictator That phosgene
and mustard will rack our titanium Maoist husks
until some white man with slanty eyes rescues us
 
from our mealy pliant selves Am I to wear Dior
wrap my mouth in bloody tulle before kneeling
bending to kiss a mouth dirtied by Pantone 136
 
No fucking thanks  Because where I’m from
these kisses are infractions  Darlings let’s rewrite
the script  Let’s hijack the narrative steer
 
the story ourselves  There’d be a heist a battle 
Audre Lorde would write the script  My leading
man would be Bruce  We’d earn our happy ending 
 
Instead they give me 1981  2012  Quantum quasars
new dystopia plutonium wars  We’re not in Polanski’s
Chinatown anymore  Yet we still have the same bowl
 
haircuts  Bangs big bang a city of fetid promise new
minor galaxy where we cannot touch  Instead our skin
is rust and metal  It gratifies the technophile in all of us
