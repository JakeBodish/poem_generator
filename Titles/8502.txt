How many suns
will cross its coign
before the last
freeze What
pennywhistle
spun its point
on the glass
breeze Whose
airs are loosened
in the pane
like miniature
degrees where
breath condenses
into rain
among the apple
trees Here
tesserae
have turned to earth
here blossoms may
attend to birth
as sun becoming
leaves here
branches seem
to lead the glass
whose scenes compose
as seasons pass
the lifetime piece
by piece     A sphere
       
Begins and ends
suppose as glaciers
drop their catch
as memory’s
a ragged seine
as grain by grain
a dead morraine
the sky is softly
sifting ash
as constellations
each rescind
to embers umbral
lees alas
the crown lens
will surely tear
to end the long
sweet refrain
of sun to moon
to sun again
of E from M
C2 
and then what breath
once shaped the pane
may lose itself
we pray in airs
our children too
had breathed in time
and theirs and theirs 
       
If oracles
recall in riddles
orreries
in orreries
the quantum of
the apple’s arc
the piper’s tune
the dancer’s turning
crown of sonnets
in the dark
by starlight ground
between the querns
spun withershins
of dawn and dusk
to wreathe a green
and weathered earth 
it’s moonshine love
and loneliness 
Do looney jigs
unwind the suns
Might jugglers drop them
every one
Are seeds resewn
or tales respun
When pipers stop
to play the bones
the very stones
are left undone 
       
To please the Sphinx
all life unreels
through black magnetic
stone-strewn fields
where pitchblende blinks
its slow decaytic-tic-tic
de-lightedly
by alpha beta
gamma delta 
time dilates
and starlight bends
in gravity
like roundelays 
All light partic-
ulate licks out
one way in waves
electric clouds
expand in spheres
whose uncracked shells
concentrically
unrecalled
across the parsecs
and the years
ring out shift red
like Hell disperse
the edges of
the universe 
       
Eclectic quarks
a dish collects
to parse into
initial text 
miraculous
exotic sky 
a Book of Kells
whose quirkish tale
in optical
if stale effects
is mirrored in
the lemur’s eye
as through the hatchling’s
candled egg
comes first light to
the cockerel 
As Sol dissolves
against the clock
and seismographic
needles track
and continents
incline to raft
uranium
sines off to lead
or raindrops pock
a full carafe
to lilypads
inside the head 
       Assymmetries
no wave contracts
