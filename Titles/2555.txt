
It wasnt our battalion but we lay alongside it
  So the story is as true as the telling is frank 
They hadnt one Line-officer left after Arras
  Except a batty major and the Colonel who drank 
 
B Company Commander was fresh from the Depot
  An expert on gas drill otherwise a dud
So Sergeant-Major Money carried on as instructed
  And thats where the swaddies began to sweat blood 
 
His Old Army humour was so well-spiced and hearty
  That one poor sod shot himself and one lost his wits
But disciplines maintained and back in rest-billets
  The Colonel congratulates B Company on their kits 
 
The subalterns went easy as was only natural
  With a terror like Money driving the machine
Till finally two Welshmen butties from the Rhondda
  Bayoneted their bugbear in a field-canteen 
 
Well we couldnt blame the officers they relied on Money
  We couldnt blame the pitboys their courage was grand
Or least of all blame Money an old stiff surviving
  In a New bloody Army he couldnt understand
