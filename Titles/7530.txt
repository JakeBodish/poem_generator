He carried a rose inside his coat each day
to give a beautiful stranger “Better to die of love   
than love without regret ” And those who loved him   
soon learned regret  “The simplest surreal act   
is running through the street with a revolver
firing at random ” Old and famous he seemed démodé    
There is always a skeleton on the buffet
