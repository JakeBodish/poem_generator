
Ill not weep that thou art going to leave me Theres nothing lovely here And doubly will the dark world grieve me While thy heart suffers there  Ill not weep because the summers glory Must always end in gloom And follow out the happiest story  It closes with a tomb And I am weary of the anguish Increasing winters bear Weary to watch the spirit languish Through years of dead despair  So if a tear when thou art dying Should haply fall from me It is but that my soul is sighing To go and rest with thee
