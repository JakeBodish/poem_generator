
   i want  to be friends  with katya  i want
  to dress  how i want to dress  like a gale      full of glitter  and back alleys  a seagull
laugh  to shake our being  whose secret lies 
  perhaps  in kicking legs upwards in delight 
       painted  an omnivorous harpy  goofy 
  loving our friends  lighting up around them 
  what a man  unstoppable  they’ll say why 
 they’re the perfect woman  now that’s me 
    judy jetson  enraged  with a penis  and
obsessed with Contact too  in every situation 
       a little Jodie Foster  o dear role modelfor my role model  find meaning  play parts 
  everything real  happens  behind the eyes 
 all those things we cannot prove  like love 
  like the world  is just  what we make of it
