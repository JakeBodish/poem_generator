
At 14th Street and First Avenue
Is a bank and in the bank the sexiest teller of all time
Next to her the greatest thing about today
Is today itself
Through which I go up
To buy books
They float by under a bluer sky
The girls uptown
Quiet pampered
The sum of all thats terrible in women
And much of the best
And the old men go by holding small packages
In a trance
So rich even they cant believe it
I think its a red white and blue letter day for them too
You see Con Eds smokestacks are beautiful
The way Queens is
And horses from a pleasant distance
Or a fleet of turkeys
Stuffed in a spotless window
In two days theyll be sweating in ovens
Thinking How did I ever get in a fix like this
Light pouring over buildings far away
Up here when someone shouts Hey
In the street you know that they arent going to kill you
Theyre yelling to a friend of theirs named Hey
John David Hey perhaps
And the garbage goes out
In big white billowy plastic bags tied at the top
And even the people go out in them
Some are waiting now
At the bus stop for a nonexistent bus
And I thought it was garbage
Its so pretty
If youre classless or modern
You can have fun by
Walking into a high-class antique store
So the stately old snob at the desk will ask
In eternity
Youre going where
You get to answer Up 
I like these old pricks
If you have an extra hair in the breeze
Their eyes pop out
And then recede way back
As if to say That person is on       dope
Theyre very correct
But theyre not in my shoes
In front of a Dubuffet a circus that shines through
A window in a bright all-yellow building
The window is my eye
And Frank OHara is the building
Im thinking about him like mad today
As anyone familiar with his poetry will tell
And about the way Madison Avenue really
Does go to heaven
And turns around and comes back disappointed
Because up here you can look down on the janitor
Or pity him
And rent a cloud-colored Bentley and
Architectures so wonderful
Why dont I notice it more often
And the young girls and boys but especially the young girls
Are drifting away from school
In blue and white wool
Wrapped in fur
Are they French Theyre speaking French
And they arent looking for things to throw
Skirts sliding up the legs of girls who cant keep from grinning
Under beautiful soft brown American eyes
At the whole world
Which includes their Plain Jane girlfriends
She even smiled at me
I have about as much chance of fucking her as the girl at the bank
But I stride along a terrifying god
Raunchy
A little one-day-old beard
And good grief I really did forget to brush my teeth this morning
Theyre turning red with embarrassment
Or is that blood
Ive been drinking I ordered a black coffee
Miss
And then a black policeman comes in
Unbuttoning his uniform at the warmish soda fountain
While I pull the fleece over my teeth
And stare innocently at the books Ive bought
One a book with a drawing
By Apollinaire called Les Fraises au MexiqueStrawberries in Mexico
But when I open the book to that page
Its just a very blue sky Im looking at
