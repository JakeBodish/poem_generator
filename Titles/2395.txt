To be or not to be that is the questionWhether tis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortuneOr to take arms against a sea of troublesAnd by opposing end them  To die to sleepNo more and by a sleep to say we endThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocksThat flesh is heir to tis a consummationDevoutly to be wishd  To die to sleepTo sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rubFor in that sleep of death what dreams may comeWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coilMust give us pause theres the respectThat makes calamity of so long life For who would bear the whips and scorns of timeThoppressors wrong the proud mans contumelyThe pangs of disprizd love the laws delayThe insolence of office and the spurnsThat patient merit of thunworthy takesWhen he himself might his quietus makeWith a bare bodkin Who would fardels bearTo grunt and sweat under a weary lifeBut that the dread of something after deathThe undiscovered country from whose bournNo traveller returns puzzles the willAnd makes us rather bear those ills we haveThan fly to others that we know not ofThus conscience does make cowards of us allAnd thus the native hue of resolutionIs sicklied oer with the pale cast of thoughtAnd enterprises of great pitch and momentWith this regard their currents turn awryAnd lose the name of action
