
Katie kissed me
Yuck its true
My face took on a greenish hue
My knees like jelly started shaking
Then my stomach started quaking
Slobber slithered down my cheek
My consciousness was growing weak
My ears were ringing my head was spinning
But all the while Kate was grinning
My heart was pounding through my shirt
My tongue felt like I just ate dirt
Though you may think Ive lost my brain
I wished shed kiss me once again
