As Rochefoucauld his maxims drew From Nature I believe em true They argue no corrupted mind In him the fault is in mankind         This maxim more than all the rest Is thought too base for human breast In all distresses of our friends We first consult our private ends While Nature kindly bent to ease us Points out some circumstance to please us         If this perhaps your patience move Let reason and experience prove         We all behold with envious eyes Our equal raisd above our size  Who would not at a crowded show Stand high himself keep others low I love my friend as well as you But would not have him stop my view  Then let him have the higher post I ask but for an inch at most         If in a battle you should find One whom you love of all mankind Had some heroic action done A champion killd or trophy won Rather than thus be overtopt Would you not wish his laurels cropt        Dear honest Ned is in the gout Lies rackd with pain and you without How patiently you hear him groan How glad the case is not your own        What poet would not grieve to see His brethren write as well as he But rather than they should excel Hed wish his rivals all in hell         Her end when emulation misses She turns to envy stings and hisses The strongest friendship yields to pride Unless the odds be on our side         Vain human kind fantastic race Thy various follies who can trace Self-love ambition envy pride Their empire in our hearts divide  Give others riches power and station Tis all on me a usurpation  I have no title to aspire Yet when you sink I seem the higher  In Pope I cannot read a line But with a sigh I wish it mine When he can in one couplet fix More sense than I can do in six It gives me such a jealous fit I cry Pox take him and his wit        Why must I be outdone by Gay In my own humrous biting way        Arbuthnot is no more my friend Who dares to irony pretend Which I was born to introduce Refind it first and showd its use         St  John as well as Pultney knows That I had some repute for prose And till they drove me out of date Could maul a minister of state  If they have mortifyd my pride And made me throw my pen aside If with such talents Heavn has blest em Have I not reason to detest em        To all my foes dear Fortune send Thy gifts but never to my friend I tamely can endure the first But this with envy makes me burst         Thus much may serve by way of proem Proceed we therefore to our poem         The time is not remote when I Must by the course of nature die When I foresee my special friends Will try to find their private ends Tho it is hardly understood Which way my death can do them good Yet thus methinks I hear em speak See how the Dean begins to break Poor gentleman he droops apace You plainly find it in his face  That old vertigo in his head Will never leave him till hes dead  Besides his memory decays He recollects not what he says He cannot call his friends to mind Forgets the place where last he dind Plies you with stories oer and oer He told them fifty times before  How does he fancy we can sit To hear his out-of-fashiond wit But he takes up with younger folks Who for his wine will bear his jokes  Faith he must make his stories shorter Or change his comrades once a quarter In half the time he talks them round There must another set be found         For poetry hes past his prime He takes an hour to find a rhyme His fire is out his wit decayd His fancy sunk his Muse a jade  Id have him throw away his pen  But theres no talking to some men        And then their tenderness appears By adding largely to my years Hes older than he would be reckond And well remembers Charles the Second         He hardly drinks a pint of wine And that I doubt is no good sign  His stomach too begins to fail Last year we thought him strong and hale But now hes quite another thing I wish he may hold out till spring         Then hug themselves and reason thus It is not yet so bad with us         In such a case they talk in tropes And by their fears express their hopes Some great misfortune to portend No enemy can match a friend  With all the kindness they profess The merit of a lucky guess When daily How dyes come of course And servants answer Worse and worse Would please em better than to tell That God be praisd the Dean is well  Then he who prophecyd the best Approves his foresight to the rest You know I always feard the worst And often told you so at first  Hed rather choose that I should die Than his prediction prove a lie  Not one foretells I shall recover But all agree to give me over         Yet should some neighbour feel a pain Just in the parts where I complain How many a message would he send What hearty prayers that I should mend Inquire what regimen I kept What gave me ease and how I slept And more lament when I was dead Than all the snivllers round my bed         My good companions never fear For though you may mistake a year Though your prognostics run too fast They must be verifyd at last         Behold the fatal day arrive How is the Dean Hes just alive  Now the departing prayer is read He hardly breathes  The Dean is dead  Before the passing-bell begun The news thro half the town has run  O may we all for death prepare What has he left and whos his heir  I know no more than what the news is Tis all bequeathd to public uses   To public use a perfect whim What had the public done for him Mere envy avarice and pride He gave it all but first he died  And had the Dean in all the nation No worthy friend no poor relation So ready to do strangers good Forgetting his own flesh and blood        Now Grub-Street wits are all employd With elegies the town is cloyd Some paragraph in evry paper To curse the Dean or bless the Drapier         The doctors tender of their fame Wisely on me lay all the blame We must confess his case was nice But he would never take advice  Had he been ruld for aught appears He might have livd these twenty years For when we opend him we found That all his vital parts were sound         From Dublin soon to London spread Tis told at Court the Dean is dead         Kind Lady Suffolk in the spleen Runs laughing up to tell the Queen  The Queen so gracious mild and good Cries Is he gone tis time he should  Hes dead you say why let him rot Im glad the medals were forgot  I promisd them I own but when I only was the Princess then But now as consort of a king You know tis quite a different thing         Now Chartres at Sir Roberts levee Tells with a sneer the tidings heavy Why is he dead without his shoes Cries Bob Im sorry for the news O were the wretch but living still And in his place my good friend Will Or had a mitre on his head Provided Bolingbroke were dead        Now Curll his shop from rubbish drains Three genuine tomes of Swifts remains And then to make them pass the glibber Revisd by Tibbalds Moore and Cibber  Hell treat me as he does my betters Publish my will my life my letters Revive the libels born to die Which Pope must bear as well as I         Here shift the scene to represent How those I love my death lament  Poor Pope will grieve a month and Gay A week and Arbuthnot a day         St  John himself will scarce forbear To bite his pen and drop a tear  The rest will give a shrug and cry Im sorry but we all must die Indifference clad in Wisdoms guise All fortitude of mind supplies For how can stony bowels melt In those who never pity felt When  we are lashd  they kiss the rod Resigning to the will of God         The fools my juniors by a year Are torturd with suspense and fear Who wisely thought my age a screen When death approachd to stand between The screen removd their hearts are trembling They mourn for me without dissembling         My female friends whose tender hearts Have better learnd to act their parts Receive the news in doleful dumps The Dean is dead and what is trumps Then Lord have mercy on his soul Ladies Ill venture for the vole  Six deans they say must bear the pall I wish I knew what king to call  Madam your husband will attend The funeral of so good a friend  No madam tis a shocking sight And hes engagd to-morrow night My Lady Club would take it ill If he should fail her at quadrille  He lovd the Dean I lead a heart But dearest friends they say must part  His time was come he ran his race We hope hes in a better place         Why do we grieve that friends should die No loss more easy to supply  One year is past a different scene No further mention of the Dean Who now alas no more is missd Than if he never did exist  Wheres now this favrite of Apollo Departed and his works must follow Must undergo the common fate His kind of wit is out of date  Some country squire to Lintot goes Inquires for Swift in Verse and Prose  Says Lintot I have heard the name He died a year ago  The same  He searcheth all his shop in vain  Sir you may find them in Duck-lane I sent them with a load of books Last Monday to the pastry-cooks  To fancy they could live a year I find youre but a stranger here  The Dean was famous in his time And had a kind of knack at rhyme  His way of writing now is past The town hath got a better taste I keep no antiquated stuff But spick and span I have enough  Pray do but give me leave to show em Heres Colley Cibbers birth-day poem  This ode you never yet have seen By Stephen Duck upon the Queen  Then heres a letter finely pennd Against the  Craftsman and his friend It clearly shows that all reflection On ministers is disaffection  Next heres Sir Roberts vindication And Mr  Henleys last oration  The hawkers have not got em yet Your honour please to buy a set        Heres Woolstons tracts the twelfth edition Tis read by every politician The country members when in town To all their boroughs send them down You never met a thing so smart The courtiers have them all by heart Those maids of honour who can read Are taught to use them for their creed  The revrend authors good intention Hath been rewarded with a pension  He doth an honour to his gown By bravely running priestcraft down He shows as sure as Gods in Gloucester That Jesus was a grand imposter That all his miracles were cheats Performd as jugglers do their feats The church had never such a writer A shame he hath not got a mitre        Suppose me dead and then suppose A club assembled at the  Rose  Where from discourse of this and that I grow the subject of their chat  And while they toss my name about With favour some and some without One quite indiffrent in the cause My character impartial draws        The Dean if we believe report Was never ill receivd at Court  As for his works in verse and prose I own myself no judge of those Nor can I tell what critics thought em But this I know all people bought em  As with a moral view designd To cure the vices of mankind His vein ironically grave Exposd the fool and lashd the knave  To steal a hint was never known But what he writ was all his own         He never thought an honour done him Because a duke was proud to own him Would rather slip aside and choose To talk with wits in dirty shoes Despisd the fools with stars and garters So often seen caressing Chartres  He never courted men in station Nor persons held in admiration Of no mans greatness was afraid Because he sought for no mans aid  Though trusted long in great affairs He gave himself no haughty airs Without regarding private ends Spent all his credit for his friends And only chose the wise and good No flattrers no allies in blood But succourd virtue in distress And seldom faild of good success As numbers in their hearts must own Who but for him had been unknown         With princes kept a due decorum But never stood in awe before em  He followd Davids lesson just In princes never put thy trust And would you make him truly sour Provoke him with a slave in powr  The Irish senate if you namd With what impatience he declaimd Fair Liberty was all his cry For her he stood prepard to die For her he boldly stood alone For her he oft exposd his own  Two kingdoms just as faction led Had set a price upon his head But not a traitor could be found To sell him for six hundred pound         Had he but spard his tongue and pen He might have rose like other men But powr was never in his thought And wealth he valud not a groat Ingratitude he often found And pityd those who meant the wound But kept the tenor of his mind To merit well of human kind Nor made a sacrifice of those Who still were true to please his foes  He labourd many a fruitless hour To reconcile his friends in powr Saw mischief by a faction brewing While they pursud each others ruin  But finding vain was all his care He left the Court in mere despair         And oh how short are human schemes Here ended all our golden dreams  What St  Johns skill in state affairs What Ormonds valour Oxfords cares To save their sinking country lent Was all destroyd by one event  Too soon that precious life was ended On which alone our weal depended  When up a dangerous faction starts With wrath and vengeance in their hearts By solemn League and Covnant bound To ruin slaughter and confound To turn religion to a fable And make the government a Babel Pervert the law disgrace the gown Corrupt the senate rob the crown To sacrifice old Englands glory And make her infamous in story When such a tempest shook the land How could unguarded Virtue stand        With horror grief despair the Dean Beheld the dire destructive scene His friends in exile or the tower Himself within the frown of power Pursud by base envenomd pens Far to the land of slaves and fens A servile race in folly nursd Who truckle most when treated worst         By innocence and resolution He bore continual persecution While numbers to preferment rose Whose merits were to be his foes When evn his own familiar friends Intent upon their private ends Like renegadoes now he feels Against him lifting up their heels         The Dean did by his pen defeat An infamous destructive cheat Taught fools their intrest how to know And gave them arms to ward the blow  Envy hath ownd it was his doing To save that helpless land from ruin While they who at the steerage stood And reapd the profit sought his blood         To save them from their evil fate In him was held a crime of state  A wicked monster on the bench Whose fury blood could never quench As vile and profligate a villain As modern Scroggs or old Tresilian Who long all justice had discarded Nor feard he God nor man regarded Vowd on the Dean his rage to vent And make him of his zeal repent But Heavn his innocence defends The grateful people stand his friends  Not strains of law nor judges frown Nor topics brought to please the crown Nor witness hird nor jury pickd Prevail to bring him in convict         In exile with a steady heart He spent his lifes declining part Where folly pride and faction sway Remote from St  John Pope and Gay         His friendships there to few confind Were always of the middling kind No fools of rank a mongrel breed Who fain would pass for lords indeed Where titles gave no right or power And peerage is a witherd flower He would have held it a disgrace If such a wretch had known his face  On rural squires that kingdoms bane He vented oft his wrath in vain Biennial squires to market brought Who sell their souls and votes for nought The nation strippd go joyful back To rob the church their tenants rack Go snacks with thieves and rapparees And keep the peace to pick up fees In evry job to have a share A jail or barrack to repair And turn the tax for public roads Commodious to their own abodes         Perhaps I may allow the Dean Had too much satire in his vein And seemd determind not to starve it Because no age could more deserve it  Yet malice never was his aim He lashd the vice but spard the name No individual could resent Where thousands equally were meant  His satire points at no defect But what all mortals may correct For he abhorrd that senseless tribe Who call it humour when they gibe  He spard a hump or crooked nose Whose owners set not up for beaux  True genuine dulness movd his pity Unless it offerd to be witty  Those who their ignorance confessd He neer offended with a jest But laughd to hear an idiot quote A verse from Horace learnd by rote         He knew a hundred pleasant stories With all the turns of Whigs and Tories Was cheerful to his dying day And friends would let him have his way         He gave the little wealth he had To build a house for fools and mad And showd by one satiric touch No nation wanted it so much  That kingdom he hath left his debtor I wish it soon may have a better
