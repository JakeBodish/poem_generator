
Think thou and act to-morrow thou shalt die
     Outstretchd in the suns warmth upon the shore
     Thou sayst Mans measurd path is all gone oerUp all his years steeply with strain and sighMan clomb until he touchd the truth and I
     Even I am he whom it was destind for 
     How should this be Art thou then so much moreThan they who sowd that thou shouldst reap therebyNay come up hither  From this wave-washd mound
     Unto the furthest flood-brim look with meThen reach on with thy thought till it be drownd 
     Miles and miles distant though the last line beAnd though thy soul sail leagues and leagues beyond 
     Still leagues beyond those leagues there is more sea
