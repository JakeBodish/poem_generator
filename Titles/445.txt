
All night vigil 
My two-and-a-half-year-old boy
and his 10-month-old sister
lay on the same bed
facing opposite ends
their feet touching 
They looked soft peaceful
bundled there in strands of blankets 
I brushed away roaches that meandered
across their faces
but not even that could wake them 
Outside the dark cover of night tore
as daybreak bloomed like a rose
on a stem of thorns 
I sat down on the backsteps
gazing across the yellowed yard 
A 1954 Chevy Bel-Air stared back 
It was my favorite possession 
I hated it just then 
It didn’t start when I tried to get it going
earlier that night  It had a bad solenoid 
I held a 12-gauge shotgun across my lap 
I expected trouble from the Paragons gang
of the west Lynwood barrio 
Somebody said I dove the car
that dudes from Colonia Watts used
to shoot up the Paragons’ neighborhood 
But I got more than trouble that night 
My wife had left around 10 p m 
to take a friend of mine home 
She didn’t come back 
I wanted to kill somebody 
At moments it had nothing to do
with the Paragons 
It had to do with a woman I loved 
But who to kill Not her–
sweet allure wrapped in a black skirt 
I’d kill myself first 
Kill me first
But she was the one who quit
Kill her No think man I was hurt angry     
but to kill her To kill a Paragon
To kill anybody
I went into the house
and put the gun away 
 
Later that morning my wife came for her things
some clothes the babies      their toys 
A radio broken TV and some dishes remained 
I didn’t stop her 
There was nothing to say that my face
didn’t explain already 
Nothing to do      but run 
 
So I drove the long haul to Downey
and parked near an enclosed area
alongside the Los Angeles River 
I got out of the car
climbed over the fence
and stumbled down the slopes 
A small line of water rippled in the middle 
On rainy days this place flooded and flowed
but most of the time it was dry
with dumped garbage and dismembered furniture 
Since a child the river and its veins of canals
were places for me to think  Places to heal 
Once on the river’s bed I began to cleanse 
I ran 
 
I ran into the mist of morning
carrying the heat of emotion
through the sun’s rays
I ran past the factories
that lay smack in the middle
of somebody’s backyard 
I ran past alleys with overturned trashcans
and mounds of tires 
Debris lay underfoot  Overgrown weeds
scraped my legs as I streamed past
recalling the song of bullets
that whirred in the wind 
 
I ran across bridges beneath overhead passes
and then back alongside the infested walls
of the concrete river
splashing rainwater as I threaded
my heels colliding against the pavement 
So much energy propelled my legs
and just like the river
it went on for miles 
 
When all was gone
the concrete river
was always there
and me always running
