
Like a bowerbird trailing a beakful of weeds   
Like prize ribbons for the very best
The lover producer   
Of another’s pleasure
He whom her swollen lips await
Might wing through any day of the decade
A form of health insurance   
For which it is never too late
Titanic silver brush
Hindenburg of exploding cigars a climax
The watery below the fiery above
Ashes of print between pigment between
If the crippled woman were to descend   
From her bed her fortress beyond midnight
Downstairs nudestaircase to the kitchen   
Naked to sit at the table writingthinking
She might hear the washer spin like a full orchestra   
Complete a cycle like a train crash
Before the fiend would stare through the window   
Step smoothly into the kitchen stop some clocks 
Envy shapes a fig tree in one’s breast   
That is bluntly to say a cancer
That is to say
In a mind a fertile windy field  A murdered child 
Well then fear primarily of falling    
Ebony surf toils on the beach a glaze
At the same moment I am from a cliff falling   
The kitchen fiend removes his Dior tie
Places his hand over the woman’s   
And softly says I am the lover 
Now if the crippled woman began to dance   
To pirouette to rumba
Growling for her child
Her burning page the devil would be shamed
Materialism is not for everyone  Religion is   
The extension of politics by other means
