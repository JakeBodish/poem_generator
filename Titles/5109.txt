
Out of cash out of well-fitting trousersOut of soap and applesOut of pencils out of my keeper’sReach  I wish to set myself afireBut may not  This morningLast night in the common room I watched the administrationOf oxygen to one who had noneAnd I would not sit down demandingTo do so Later I happened on a manAt the piano and though I have happened five or six times On men at the pianoNone moved his hand like thisWithin the keys I sat beside him looking for a soundA chest sound  Not listening I don’t listenAnymore  I make musicBut I don’t listen
