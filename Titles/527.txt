
You’re right  I meant “midst” not “mist ”
I don’t know what I was stinking
I mean thinking soap speaks intimately
to my skin every day  Most days 
Depending if darkness has risen
to my skull like smoke up a chimney floe 
Flue  Then no stepping nude
into the shower no mist turning
the bathroom mirror into frosted glass
where my face would float
coldly in the oval  Picture a caveman
encased in ice  Good  I like how
your mind works how your eyes
inside your mind works and your actual eyes
reading this their icy precision nothing
slips by them  Even now I can feel you
hovering silently above these lines
hawkish Godlike each period
a lone figure kneeling in the snow 
That’s too solemn  I would like to send
search parties and rescue choppers
to every period ever printed 
I would like to apologize to my wife
for not showering on Monday and Tuesday 
I was stinking  I was simultaneously
numb and needled with anxiety
in the midst of a depressive episode 
Although “mist” would work too
metaphorically speaking in the mist of
in the fog of this gray haze that followed me
relentlessly from room to room
until every red bell inside my head
was wrong  Rung
