
Where is the grave of Sir Arthur OKellynWhere may the grave of that good man be By the side of a spring on the breast of HelvellynUnder the twigs of a young birch treeThe oak that in summer was sweet to hearAnd rustled its leaves in the fall of the yearAnd whistled and roared in the winter aloneIs gone and the birch in its stead is grown  The Knights bones are dustAnd his good sword rust His soul is with the saints I trust
