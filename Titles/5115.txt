
Lie down you are horizontal  Stand up you are not I wanted my fate to be human Like a perfume that does not choose the direction it travelsthat cannot be straight or crooked kept out or kept Yes No Or a day a life slips through themtaking off the third skin taking off the fourth And the logic of shoes becomes at last simplean animal question scuffing Old shoes old roads the questions keep being new ones Like two negative numbers multiplied by rain into oranges and olives
