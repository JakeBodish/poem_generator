The rock lives in the desert solid taking its time The wave lives for an instant stable in momentumat the edge of the sea before it folds away Everything that is lives and has size The mole sleeps in a hole of its making and the hole also lives absence is not nothing It didn’t desire to be but now it breathesand makes a place for the comfort of the mole I am a space taken and my absence will be shapelyand of a certain age in the everlasting In the fierce evening on the mild dayHow long shall I be shakenHabakkuk
