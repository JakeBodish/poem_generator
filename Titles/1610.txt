
At the moment of my mother’s death I am rinsing frozen chicken  No vision no rending of the temple curtain onlythe soft give of meat  I had not seen her in four days  I thought her better and the hospital did not call so I am fresh from an office Christmas party scotch on my breath as I answer the phone  And in one moment all my past acts become irrevocable
