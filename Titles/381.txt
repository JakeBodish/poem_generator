
It must be difficult for God listening
to our voices come up through his floor
of cloud to tell Him what’s been taken away
Lord I’ve lost my dog my period my hair
all my money  What can He say given
we’re so incomplete we can’t stop being
surprised by our condition while He
is completeness itself Or is God more
like us made in His image shaking His head
because He can’t be expected to keep track
of which voice goes with what name and address
He being just one God  Either way we seem
to be left here to discover our losses everything
from car keys to larger items we can’t search
our pockets for destined to face them
on our own  Even though the dentist gives us
music to listen to and the assistant looks down
with her lovely smile it’s still our tooth
he yanks out leaving a soft spot we ponder
with our tongue for days  Left to ourselves
we always go over and over what’s missing 
tooth dog money self-control and even losses
as troubling as the absence the widower can’t stop
reaching for on the other side of his bed a year
later  Then one odd afternoon watching something
as common as the way light from the window
lingers over a vase on the table or how the leaves
on his backyard tree change colors all at once
in a quick wind he begins to feel a lightness
as if all his loss has led to finding just this 
Only God knows where the feeling came from
or maybe God’s not some knower off on a cloud
but there in the eye which tears up now
at the strangest moments over the smallest things
