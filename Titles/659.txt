I place a photograph of my uncle on my computer desktop which means I learn to ignore it  He stands by a tank helmet tilting to his right bootlaces tightened as if stitching together a wound  Alive the hand brings up a cigarette we wont see him taste  Last night I smoked one on the steps outside my barn apartment  A promise I broke myself  He promised himself he wouldnt and did  I smell my fingers and I am smelling his  Hands of smoke and gunpowder  Hands that promised they wouldnt but did  
This album is a stop-loss  By a dim lantern
or in the latrine
he flips through it 
He looks at himself
looking nearly as he does 
closest to himself then
as he could be just learning
how to lean into his new body 
He suspends there
by standing order
a spreading fire in his chest
his groin  He is on stage
for us to see him see him
He stands in the noontime sun

your whole body in a photo your whole body sitting on a crate pressing your eyesocket to the viewfinder of a bazooka crouched as you balance the metal tube on your shoulder in one you guide a belt of ammo into the untiring weapon proud your elbow out as if mid-waltz your frame strong and lightly supporting the gun a kind of smile ruining the picture 
You’re posing  You’re scared 
A body falls
and you learn to step over
a loosened head  You begin to appreciate
the heft of your boot soles
how they propel you
how they can kick in
a face–
the collapse
of a canopy bed
in an aerial bombardment
mosquito netting doused
in napalm–cheekbones fragile
as moth wings beneath the heel 
You tighten your laces
until they hold together
a capable man 
Whatever rains
the weight of your feet
swings you forward
goose-stepping pendulums
a body less and less yours–
a body God knows
is not what makes you
anyway  So the hands
that said they never would
begin finding
grenade pins around their fingers
begin flipping through this album
with soot under their nails
you were not ready
But they issued the shovel and the rifle and you dug
But to watch you sitting there between the sandbags
But to watch the sand spilling out the bullet holes
But what did they expect
But what did they really think a sheet of metal could prevent
But I sat rolling little ears of pasta off my thumb like helmets
But it was not a table of fallen men
But my hand registered fatigue
But the men in fatigues were tired of sleeping in shifts
But you snuck into town and dialed home until you wrote your fingers
       were tired
But the code for Shiraz was down
But all of Shiraz was down
But the sheet lightning above the Ferris wheel of rusted bolts
But I am sure they are alright you wrote Well to reassure yourself
But the wind like an old mouth shaking the unnamed evergreen outside
       my window
But what I mean is Id like very much to talk a bitHello
 
 Operation Ramadan was an offensive in the Iran-Iraq War  It was launched by Iran in July 1982 near Basra and featured the use of human wave attacks in one of the largest land battles since World War II  Aftermath The operation was the first of many disastrous offensives which cost thousands of lives on both sides  This one in general boosted the casualty limit up to 80000 killed 200000 wounded and 45000 captured  In retrospect the Iranians lacked effective command and control air support and logistics to sustain an attack in the first place  Saddam Hussein offered several ceasefire attempts in the following year none of which were accepted by the Revolutionary regime  6 dead link

pointing with their noseThats the mother of a martyr
They are building a museum
