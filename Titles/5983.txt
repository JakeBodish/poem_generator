
I am not saying “mark my words”as the thief says early each winter He leaves nothing of value  He too wants A brute with language he has a fondnessfor preaching  I am bathed to luster Memories move musically through my bones He sings above vaults off a horse with feignedkindness lands so fancy  Letting go of this sitting with tropical leaves the size of menin a terrarium I am beautiful  He means well admonishing women  He is lucky with the show of crankiness What does it mean to let go the envyI sometimes hope stars don’t spread themselvesover New York’s lights  Performing for himselfglasses glittering he reads stories of povertyclaims them all as his own  Here in Colorado irises of all colors unfoldoutwards to the half-hidden sun  On the cracked cement chilly before rain I see perpetual beginnings  I’m going to forget himlock him in a box in my headlock him in the haunt of violins let go what’s his in the hurl of breath of my groans
