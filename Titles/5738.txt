In the village it’s the season of dried grassthe smell of   burned dirtgaslight glinting through blackened stubble I walk home across the rice-fieldsbrushing insects away from my faceremembering old Namdong who was buried yesterday What does death ask of usI must change whatever it was I waswhen the old man was alive I keep looking at the rice-fields glinting in the dark Blasted by mildew more withered than last year  how much work and love it must have taken In autumn no matter how bad the harvesthow big the debts  no thought of   leaving here no thought of rest As life goes on time isn’t the largest thing to think ofit’s the smallest Growing goingin drought or monsoon mold or blight  what is the rice if  not alive With Sunja Kim Kwock
