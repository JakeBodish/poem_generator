
Where youve fallen you will stay 
In the whole universe this one
and only place is the sole place
which you have made your very own 
The country runs away from you 
House mill poplar every thing
is struggling with you here as if
in nothingness mutating 
But now its you who wont give up 
Did we fleece you Youve grown rich 
Did we blind you You watch us still 
You bear witness without speech
