
I turned twenty-four and
dad decided to take
another stab at making
a man out of me 
On his command I drove us
out to Hollywood where
you could get three sets of suits
for a hundred bucks What a steal he exclaimed
as though his enthusiasm
would fertilize
something that never
existed within me 
Regardless I followed him
into the outlet and I
allowed him to wrap
the cheap heavy thread
around my tired shoulders
to salt the wound of my body
with his idea of truth 
I let it happen
but I did not forget
what I was
beneath the cover of the fleshfive million faggy mountainsslicing through fields fullof dreamed-up tongues andunnamable bluish grasseseach blade the lengthof a universestretching inward towarda singular pointoflife-sustaining unlogic 
Dressing myself behind
the heavy polyester curtain
I listened
as dad held the suit guy hostage
with the oft-told tale
of the night he encountered
real-life Biblical demons
how at first he felt their presence
tightening inside his chest
and then witnessed them crawling
up and down his walls
and how he prayed and cursed them
in the name of the lord
until they dissolved
like sugar into the dark
And he never said this but I
knew he was convinced they
came for me nextand colored my nailsand stretched out my hairand adorned me with flowersand forced my inside places to whisperwoman         woman               womanlate each night at themoment justbefore sleep
And I knew he knew
who I was becoming
and I understood
what the suits were for      So
I tossed them in the back
of my trunk
where they sat
waiting for years
and the day I sold that car offthose suits were still in there
