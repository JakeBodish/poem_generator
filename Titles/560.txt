
I can remember when I wanted X
more than anything ever for X fill in
from your own childhood
 
balloon pencil lead trading card shoelaces a bow
or not to have to wear a bow
 
and now I am moved to action when I am moved
principally by a memory of what to want 
 
The point is to be in your own eyes what you are
 
or to keep your own tools so that you can pretend 
 
And so it was no surprise
to me at least when Cooper who is two
collapsed in fortissimo fits when he could not have
a 20 three-foot-long stuffed frog
in the image of Frog from Frog and Toad since he is Toad 
 
That morning needing a nap
he had thrown from the third-story balcony
of Millers Cafe and Bakery into the whistling
rapids and shallows
of the Ammonoosuc River with its arrowheads and caravans of stones
his Red Sox cap  His hair was shining like
another planets second sun
as he explained looking up I threw my hat in the river 
I would like my hat back now
