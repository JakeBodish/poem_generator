Trojan could remain While Anna beggd and Dido ragd in vain  Then grave Clarissa graceful wavd her fan Silence ensud and thus the nymph began         Say why are beauties praisd and honourd most The wise mans passion and the vain mans toast Why deckd with all that land and sea afford Why angels calld and angel-like adord Why round our coaches crowd the white-glovd beaux Why bows the side-box from its inmost rows How vain are all these glories all our pains Unless good sense preserve what beauty gains That men may say when we the front-box grace Behold the first in virtue as in face Oh if to dance all night and dress all day Charmd the smallpox or chasd old age away Who would not scorn what housewifes cares produce Or who would learn one earthly thing of use To patch nay ogle might become a saint Nor could it sure be such a sin to paint  But since alas frail beauty must decay Curld or uncurld since locks will turn to grey Since painted or not painted all shall fade And she who scorns a man must die a maid What then remains but well our powr to use And keep good humour still whateer we lose And trust me dear good humour can prevail When airs and flights and screams and scolding fail  Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll Charms strike the sight but merit wins the soul         So spoke the dame but no applause ensud Belinda frownd Thalestris calld her prude  To arms to arms the fierce virago cries And swift as lightning to the combat flies  All side in parties and begin th attack Fans clap silks rustle and tough whalebones crack Heroes and heroines shouts confusdly rise And bass and treble voices strike the skies  No common weapons in their hands are found Like gods they fight nor dread a mortal wound         So when bold Homer makes the gods engage And heavnly breasts with human passions rage Gainst Pallas Mars Latona Hermes arms And all Olympus rings with loud alarms  Joves thunder roars heavn trembles all around Blue Neptune storms the bellowing deeps resound Earth shakes her nodding towrs the ground gives way And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day        Triumphant Umbriel on a sconces height Clappd his glad wings and sate to view the fight Proppd on their bodkin spears the sprites survey The growing combat or assist the fray         While through the press enragd Thalestris flies And scatters death around from both her eyes A beau and witling perishd in the throng One died in metaphor and one in song  O cruel nymph a living death I bear Cried Dapperwit and sunk beside his chair  A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast Those eyes are made so killing was his last  Thus on Mæeanders flowry margin lies Th expiring swan and as he sings he dies         When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down Chloe steppd in and killd him with a frown She smild to see the doughty hero slain But at her smile the beau revivd again         Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air Weighs the mens wits against the ladys hair The doubtful beam long nods from side to side At length the wits mount up the hairs subside         See fierce Belinda on the baron flies With more than usual lightning in her eyes Nor feard the chief th unequal fight to try Who sought no more than on his foe to die  But this bold lord with manly strength endud She with one finger and a thumb subdud Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew A charge of snuff the wily virgin threw The Gnomes direct to evry atom just The pungent grains of titillating dust  Sudden with starting tears each eye oerflows And the high dome re-echoes to his nose         Now meet thy fate incensd Belinda cried And drew a deadly bodkin from her side  The same his ancient personage to deck Her great great grandsire wore about his neck In three seal-rings which after melted down Formd a vast buckle for his widows gown Her infant grandames whistle next it grew The bells she jingled and the whistle blew Then in a bodkin gracd her mothers hairs Which long she wore and now Belinda wears         Boast not my fall he cried insulting foe Thou by some other shalt be laid as low  Nor think to die dejects my lofty mind All that I dread is leaving you benind Rather than so ah let me still survive And burn in Cupids flames but burn alive         Restore the lock she cries and all around Restore the lock the vaulted roofs rebound  Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain Roard for the handkerchief that causd his pain  But see how oft ambitious aims are crossd The chiefs contend till all the prize is lost The lock obtaind with guilt and kept with pain In evry place is sought but sought in vain With such a prize no mortal must be blest So Heavn decrees with Heavn who can contest        Some thought it mounted to the lunar sphere Since all things lost on earth are treasurd there  There heros wits are kept in pondrous vases And beaux in snuff boxes and tweezercases  There broken vows and deathbed alms are found And lovers hearts with ends of riband bound The courtiers promises and sick mans prayers The smiles of harlots and the tears of heirs Cages for gnats and chains to yoke a flea Dried butterflies and tomes of casuistry         But trust the Muse she saw it upward rise Though markd by none but quick poetic eyes So Romes great founder to the heavns withdrew To Proculus alone confessd in view A sudden star it shot through liquid air And drew behind a radiant trail of hair  Not Berenices locks first rose so bright The heavns bespangling with dishevelld light  The Sylphs behold it kindling as it flies And pleasd pursue its progress through the skies         This the beau monde shall from the Mall survey And hail with music its propitious ray  This the blest lover shall for Venus take And send up vows from Rosamondas lake  This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies When next he looks through Galileos eyes And hence th egregious wizard shall foredoom The fate of Louis and the fall of Rome         Then cease bright nymph to mourn thy ravishd hair Which adds new glory to the shining sphere Not all the tresses that fair head can boast Shall draw such envy as the lock you lost  For after all the murders of your eye When after millions slain yourself shall die When those fair suns shall set as set they must And all those tresses shall be laid in dust This lock the Muse shall consecrate to fame And midst the stars inscribe Belindas name
