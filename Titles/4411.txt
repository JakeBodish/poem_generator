
Looking out at a man’s name on a battered wingtip
in strong winds was it planned that when
the cheap wing bends the name stays steady
What if it didn’t matter how much
you trod over the body of your mother what happened
when you were younger how you tried forgetting
and forgot to forgive  Something has to hold you numbers columns
cards to swipe books to shelve
pints to pour  A life filled with fixed wings with hard grasps
with the grateful  What’s worth keeping
Not the sad boy who blamed you for all the ways he was broken 
Not the man’s name on the wing but
why not the battered wing itself  Why not the woman thinking 
Why not the river below its lips wet footprints animal 
What forked tongues come when clouds crack open
when this sky’s watched you sleep all day
and now lets down its darkness  There’s all night to stay awake
