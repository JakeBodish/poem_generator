
You cant argue beautys not an accident the particular heft and angle
of a chromosomes spin  A tarted spangle bright lanyard twist the slip
of cells weighting this boat uneven from stern to prow  Were all
skittery as marbles on  a marble floor  Beauty stays then goes
it fades we say something about years and sun the nights we slept
in makeup and left mascara like ashes on the pillowcase  We burned
through every one of our dreams  I wasnt always a stepmother you know 
There were whole years when I was a girl  But now these ladies
sell me moisturizer stand close in their lab coats pretending at science
in a fog of perfume  They wield a contour brush and my cheekbone pops 
The magic settles uneasy it turns out fairy dust was always
fake  And the lipsticks made from beetles shells crushed vermillion 
My color is Fleshpot they say its Folie or Fixation  Its Wilderness
its Artificial Earth  They cant quite make themselves care 
Well waste it they know whatever weve been given
