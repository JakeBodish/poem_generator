
An old woodcut of the London Bridge   
and a colored lithograph of a barley field    
There are no other pictures on Ward D 
The London Bridge lifts sooty towers above the river    
But its the barley field I see    
A golden ocean of barley 
Its not like the other grain-fields    
Maybe its those inward-looking eyes   
gone into it so it becomes heaven
A fall-colored sky mild   
with no harvesters and no scythes
