
How can we die when were already
prone to leaving the table mid-meal
like Ancient Ones gone to breathe
elsewhere  Salt sits still but peppers gone
rolled off in a rush  Weve practiced dying
for a long time when we skip dance or town
when we chew  Weve rounded out
like dining room walls in a canyon eaten
through by wind Sorry we rushed off
the food wasnt ours  Sorry the grease sits
white on our plates and the jam that didnt set 
use it as syrup to cover every theory of us
