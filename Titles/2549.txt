The first said ‘Here’s a right brave soldier   That walks the dark unfearinglySoon he’ll come back on a fine stretcher   And laughing for a nice Blighty ’
 
The second ‘Read his face old comrade   No kind of lucky chance I seeOne day he’ll freeze in mud to the marrow   Then look his last on Picardie ’
 
Though bitter the word of these first twain   Curses the third spat venomously‘He’ll stay untouched till the war’s last dawning   Then live one hour of agony ’
 
Liars the first two were  Behold me   At sloping arms by one – two – threeWaiting the time I shall discover   Whether the third spake verity
