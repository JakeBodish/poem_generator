Recite your lines aloud Ronsard advisedOr even better sing them  Common speechHeld all the rhythmic measures that he prizedIn poetry  He had much more to teachBut first he taught that  Several poets paidHim heed  The odd one even made the gradeBuilding a pretty castle on the beach But on the whole it’s useless to point outThat making the thing musical is partOf pinning down what you are on about The voice leads to the craft the craft to artAll this is patent to the gifted fewWho know before they can what they must doTo make the mind a spokesman for the heart As for the million others they are blessedThis is their age  Their slapdash in demandFrom all who would take fright were thought expressedIn ways that showed a hint of being plannedThey may say anything in any way Why not Why shouldn’t they Why wouldn’t theyNothing to study nothing to understand And yet it could be that their flight from rhymeAnd reason is a technically preciseResponse to the confusion of a timeWhen nothing said once merits hearing twice It isn’t that their deafness fails to matchThe chaos  It’s the only thing they catch No form no pattern  Just the rolling diceOf idle talk  Always a blight beforeIt finds a place today fulfills a needAs those who cannot write increase the storeOf verses fit for those who cannot readFor those who can do both the field is clearTo meet and trade their wares the only fearThat mutual benefit might look like greed It isn’t though  It’s just the interchangeOf showpiece and attention that has beenThere since the cavemen took pains to arrangePictures of deer and bison to be seen To best advantage in the flickering light Our luck is to sell tickets on the nightOnly to those who might know what we meanAnd they are drawn to us by love of sound In the first instance it is how we singThat brings them in  No mystery more profoundThan how a melody soars from a stringOf syllables and yet this much we knowRonsard was right to emphasize it soEven in his day  Now it’s everythingThe language falls apart before our eyesBut what it once was echoes in our earsAs poetry whose gathered force defiesEven the drift of our declining years A single lilting line a single turnOf phrase these always proved at last we learnLife cries for joy though it must end in tears
