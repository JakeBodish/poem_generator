
This saying good-by on the edge of the dark
And the cold to an orchard so young in the bark
Reminds me of all that can happen to harm
An orchard away at the end of the farm
All winter cut off by a hill from the house 
I dont want it girdled by rabbit and mouse
I dont want it dreamily nibbled for browse
By deer and I dont want it budded by grouse 
If certain it wouldnt be idle to call
Id summon grouse rabbit and deer to the wall
And warn them away with a stick for a gun 
I dont want it stirred by the heat of the sun 
We made it secure against being I hope
By setting it out on a northerly slope 
No orchards the worse for the wintriest storm
But one thing about it it mustnt get warm 
How often already youve had to be told
Keep cold young orchard  Good-by and keep cold 
Dread fifty above more than fifty below 
I have to be gone for a season or so 
My business awhile is with different trees
Less carefully nourished less fruitful than these
And such as is done to their wood with an ax 
Maples and birches and tamaracks 
I wish I could promise to lie in the night
And think of an orchards arboreal plight
When slowly and nobody comes with a light
Its heart sinks lower under the sod 
But something has to be left to God
