
Thy voice is heard thro rolling drums      That beat to battle where he standsThy face across his fancy comes      And gives the battle to his handsA moment while the trumpets blow      He sees his brood about thy kneeThe next like fire he meets the foe      And strikes him dead for thine and thee
