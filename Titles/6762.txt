Leoš Janáček and Kamila Stösslová



She reads romances she spells poorly she’s full-breasted   
broad in the beam matron in a cloche hat
bulky knee-length skirt apron thick calves white stockings Mary Janes 
Her heels go click click on the pavement 
She has those dark Gypsy eyes and the wide laugh 
He loves it when she tosses her head like that 
And here she is in long skirt and embroidered blouse posing   
by her dwarf ornamental orange tree on the balcony
high pale forehead stacked dark hair heavy jaw bust cleaving forward like a prow    
And here she is on holiday with her husband the businessman the perpetual traveller   
with the commanding walk and striped tie and blunt mustache 
“Two decidedly Jewish types” writes Zdenka Janáčková J’s wife
they send her in the last year of the war   
bread butter eggs semolina flour geese   
from the husband’s military contacts 

“My dear dark dove” J calls Kamila “My little one ”   

He has taken dictation from every fountain in Hukvaldy   
where he was born to endless mumbled rosaries of water    
He notes the gush and prattle of the Fox’s Well
as the beech tree flashes its sleight of leaf and fox kits hide in the rocks   
the public fountain “a fine of ten crowns
on those who fail to replace the cover”
and when the cover is replaced
the fountain closes her eyes
the castle fountain handsome broad and brimming but scuttled into pipes
for manor farm brewery and slaughterhouse
where the stream blurts out in blood
and the little well hidden through tall grass at Kazničov   
springing up through the roots of three lime trees “Helisov’s Well”
chants the little girl and he notes that too the quavering fall   
of the name and watches water bugs skitter
and green moss darkling at the bottom and shards of sky    

Bread butter eggs semolina flour geese 
Kamila knows nothing of music she worries about her dress   
for the première of Jenůfa in Vienna 
She has two little boys Rudi and Otto 
Otto the baby swims on her hand
and she leans over him soft as night one eyebrow tilted up   
as at a dream of which she is hardly aware    

“She was of medium height dark curly-haired like a Gypsy woman”   
writes Zdenka “with great black bulging eyes 
The voice was unpleasant shrill ”   

 That once again he saw “her raven hair all loose”
and she was barefoot in the house
and she climbed a ladder to pick apricots from the tree   
and she refused the gift of the knitted silver bag
“And your eye has a strange depth it’s so deep it doesn’t shine ”   

Night leans hugely 
He sleeps alone in his study upstairs at the Organ School    
Zdenka sleeps in their villa across the yard    

He who had scrawled
on his cuffs on envelope scraps on market paper in his little pad   
robins’ trills girls’ chatter at the railway station
fox bark thrush whistle hen cackle
kitten mew bee hum “the chord of stalagmites covered with hoarfrost”   
the airy bell-like patter of fountain spray
    scored
    in a notebook
    years before Kamila
    in a notebook
    2 A M  24 February 1903
    his daughter’s dying   
    words 
    Olga 
    dying age 21 
    in a notebook 
    “Now I remember that I’m supposed to die”
    a little string of quarter notes B and middle C 
    “What walks we took on the corso” “We
    should say so much ”
    He tells her
    “You are the most beautiful among them” and she smiles   
    in his notebook she smiles 
    And down to a G
    “Something gets lost so well no one can find it ”
    In a notebook 
    245 A M  25 February 1903 Olga
    her light hair spread across the pillow
    sighs
    “A-y-a” two drawn out B’s scrupulously noted by her father   
    and in the margin
    “God be with you my soul ”   

What can be assimilated into song   

The rivers of Lachia the River Lubina
falls from a ridge of the Radhošť Mountain
into an abyss to seethe of silver crash of dark
the Ondřejnice dabbles through the village of Mĕrkovice
past mossy banks shallow beery-blonde tepid where goslings swim
dunking for weeds and bugs and the River Ostravice   
is the color of steel and smites the wrist with cold
and all the Lachian rivers run
through cello depths horn hurtle foam-spray of glockenspiel   
clash of cymbals at the smoky inn
where Sofie Harabisová flies from arm to arm
in the glare smoke sweat and stamp of feet
“Where is the poet Šťastný or Professor Batĕk or Mrs  Marie Jungova now
Gone all gone those who took part
that wild summer night forty-five years ago”   

Kamila reads romances 
“There’s no love just innocent   
friendship  My husband’s   
away all the time he’s always   
got things to do ”   

“Your raven hair 
I write these lines so they’ll be read and yet unread   
because unanswered 
So it’s like a stone falling into water ”
“You’re the star I look for in evening ”   
“I was your shadow ”   
“Even thoughts become flesh ”
in the fountain bubbling up among the lime tree roots   
mumbling its prayers over and over tonguing the stones    

Now after the war no need
for bread butter eggs semolina flour geese delivered   
by special connection
and Czechoslovakia is free in the Sinfonietta in the razzle of brass
“I’m really
an ordinary woman Your heart would stop   
aching if you saw me more ”
There’s Rudi there’s Otto
and her husband always dealing in his antiques 
No we cannot attend the première in Prague no we cannot    
Now after the war 
For that cold boil three onions with marjoram and lemon peel   
and drink it like tea with sugar 
Your raven hair 
I was your shadow when you reached for the apricots    

Gut scrapings the bow scrapes sunlight from that summer day at the spa at Luhačovice   
where she sat on the grass “like an exhausted little bird”
“Dear Madam Accept these few roses as a token”
where she sat on the grass scrape sunlight   
from the inner petals scrape the dark from   
her pupil so deep it doesn’t shine 
Madam
“Silence goes to sleep under every tree ”   
Under the tilt of her shadowed brow    
His baby son died those years ago
                                                      and Olga’s hair   
spreads wide across the pillow where she sighs 
He sleeps alone   
it’s like a stone   
falling    

Lullaby
bee swarms
gut scraping fracture a waltz
falters the schmaltzy tune with raven hair   
whispers breaks off and the hand she lets him   
touch for the first time she does not draw away   
the first time “your little hand”
in eleven years under the linden boughs 
“That dark Jewess” writes Zdenka “I rather   
liked her at first but I held my position    
You know how artists are  They have to be   
handled  I would not                                    
                                                                let him go ”   

“These letters were written in fire ”
Zdenka must   
                understand
                                    Kamila is
the Gypsy girl Káťa Kabanová the Vixen Aljeja
the little hidden well by the lime trees at Kazničov   
the military fanfare on the promenade
trumpet oboe piccolo squeal
when the Austrians march out the Empire crashes and the country is   
like the high-wire flute notes finally free 
Zdenka must acknowledge this   
          These letters
                     were written in fire    

By now Kamila’s boys have been stuffed into trousers stiff collars and neckties    
They’ve grown leggy their faces are plump 
It’s a question of tempi slightly retarded a vertigo   
the viola suffers following the violins 
Silence goes to sleep under every tree 
The cello drags
gusts of confetti repetition emotion is all
repetition
pulled by twisted horsehair   
out of gut 
My dear dark dove a form of mourning
that too is a form   
of repetition 
Why don’t you write 
So when those last days she has come   
at last with little Otto respectably
to visit the upstairs room he has built and furnished for her
in his summer cottage in Hukvaldy
furnished according to his dream 
“I want to have the painting of those two cherubs a writing desk a communal table
a comfortable bed perhaps of brass a wardrobe with mirrored doors a marble wash-stand
and four chairs each from a different part of the world ”   
   the question is what can be assimilated   
   into song
she peels oranges makes tea
they shop in the market and play and walk
and August 8 on the walk up the Babí hůra Hill Otto gets lost in the woods and ravines 
Something gets lost so well no one can find it 
and Leoš seeks and seeks the child in drenching rain   
as if searching for his own
son
in the woods and ravines
under the wing of her darkly tilting brow
and returns   
fevered 
In a notebook no one writes no one scores his cough    
10 August 1928 J consents to go   
to the hospital in Ostrava
pneumonia deterioration sedative
      What walks we took on the corso   
             Something gets lost so well   
      So it’s like a stone
      Silence goes to sleep under every tree   
             I was your shadow   
      I burned your letters but I keep                  
                                                                        the ash
No one scored the sleep rattle in Ostrava
12 August 10 A M  Sunday Kamila at his side
a heavy woman who spells poorly broad in the beam   
with thick knees and white stockings
who reads romances
who will die of cancer
seven years later
at 43
and be buried in the Jewish cemetery in Písek 
       “And I kissed you
       And you are sitting beside me and I am happy and at peace   
       In such a way do the days pass for the angels ”
No one scored the sleep rattle Sunday 12 August    
Only then by his order
Zdenka   
is told
and arrives by train 
                                    These letters were written in fire
