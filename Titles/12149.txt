The first day was a long dayand the first night nearly eternal No thing existed and only One was presentto perceive what wasn’t there No meaning as we know itdifference was bound in the All On the first day water on the second day land on the third day two kinds of lightone of them night On the fourth day laughter and darkness saw it was good   But when God laugheda crack ran through creation  On the fourth night sorrowstaring away from heaventorn in its ownness No evidence then of nothingbut worlds upon worldsunderwritten overflowingthe worlds of fear and of longinglacking in beliefand the pitiful world of love forever granting its own wishes Out of dust like golems God created man and womanand cast them into chance And man was subdued in those days All that could leap leaptall that could weep wept First of all places Edenlast of all places Clevelandand a river flowed out of Edeninspiring in the dry land a panic of growth and harvest season The newly formed creationtook from flesh its beastand from each word its sentence And early loves and hatreds blewfrom thistle to thorn Each thing that God createdhe placed before manso that he may name itcloudbank hawk’s eye lambkin
