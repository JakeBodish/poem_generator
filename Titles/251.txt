
On the side of the road a deer frozen frigid Go back to your life the voice said What is my life she wondered  For months she lost
herself in work Freud said work is as important
as love to the soul and at night she sat with a boy
forcing him to practice his violin helping him recite his notes 
Then the ice thawed and the deer came to life 
She saw her jump over the fence she saw her in the twilight
how free she looked  She saw her eyes shiny as marbles
as much a part of this world as the fence a worker
pounds into the earth  At night she still sat with the boy 
He’s learning “Au Claire de la Lune ”
Do you know it He has established a relationship
with his violin  He knows that it takes practice to master it
the accuracy of each note to wrestle his feelings to the listener 
But he’s impatient  Sometimes what he hears and feels
are not always the same  Again the poet says 
She knows if he tries to silence his fervor he might not ever know
who he is  The poet contemplates whether a deer can dream 
Rich blood-red berries on a branch pachysandra in the garden 
A soft warm bed in the leaves
