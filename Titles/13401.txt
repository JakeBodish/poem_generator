
little tree little silent Christmas tree you are so little you are more like a flower who found you in the green forest and were you very sorry to come away see          i will comfort you because you smell so sweetly i will kiss your cool bark and hug you safe and tight just as your mother would only dont be afraid look          the spangles that sleep all the year in a dark box dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads put up your little arms and ill give them all to you to hold every finger shall have its ring and there wont be a single place dark or unhappy then when youre quite dressed youll stand in the window for everyone to see and how theyll stare oh but youll be very proud and my little sister and i will take hands and looking up at our beautiful tree well dance and sing Noel Noel
