
Then take this tambourine
inside the sheep barn
listen to the anacondas intestines
the sharks walking stick
learn the river insects secret
neon calligraphy
swim through Frida Khalos hair
and come out smelling like orchids
lift your appetite
towards the certified blue turtle
feast on Garcia Lorcas leather shoes
and taste the sun the worms of Andalusia
dont hesitate in front of a donut
a ferris wheel the crab nebula
excavate diamond-eyed demons
Chaucers liver Minoan helmets
paste Anne Sextons face on a 1000 bill
and purchase a dozen metaphors
beware of the absolute scorpion
the iguana with the limping leg
permit indwelling white words around the eyes
the confrontation of windows
never feed your towel to the alligator
he will eat you and eat you and eat you
