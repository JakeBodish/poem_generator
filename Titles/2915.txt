
i was left out
i was chosen second  then left out
i was left
handed  i was left
to fend for myself   i 
was the second in
command  the second
in line   i came
without direction
            
i want the 
milk  i want my
first pick  i want
choice    all its implications  there was a
            
residue of
scar
between us  it chafed
when we rubbed our
chests together
            
                                     hello brother hello
hello in there brother can you
hear me  its a long
tunnel to the grave    speak

first god  i was rapt in your
coming
                         mother better
eat her vegetables she better chew choo

asked me whats

her like something
hot  or fragile   or in
pain  i was
aghast  at suffering how you can feed
 feed it
                its never
full
            
                          theres a separation
between us  a suppuration  theres just the  
space of an idea  i dont know whats
missing  its a blind
spot  sometimes my left eye
focuses  its like looking at
both of us through a
window
            
                                    im telling you the
facts of life for

fifties  youre dis-
eased or disinterested  a
queer unable to
come out of the casket  OK

better mother i
