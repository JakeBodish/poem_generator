
We had been married for six or seven years when my wife standing in the kitchen one afternoon told methat she screams underwater when she swims that in fact she has been screaming for yearsinto the blue chlorinated water of the community poolwhere she does laps every other day   Buttering her toast not as if she had been concealing anything not as if I should consider myselfpersonally the cause of her screamingnor as if we should perform an act of therapy  right that minute on the kitchen table casually she told me and I could see her turn her square face up to take a gulp of oxygenthen down again into the cold wet mask of the unconscious For all I know maybe everyone is screaming as they go through life silentlypolitely keeping the big secret that it is not all funto be ripped by the crooked beakof something called psychologyto be dipped down again and again into timethat the truest most intimate pleasure you can sometimes findis the wet kiss of your own pain There goes Kath at one pm to swim her twenty-two lapsback and forth in the community pool  what discipline she hasTwenty-two laps like twenty-two pages that will never be read by anyone
