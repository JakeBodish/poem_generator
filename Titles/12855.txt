Cromwell our chief of men who through a cloud        Not of war only but detractions rude        Guided by faith and matchless fortitude        To peace and truth thy glorious way hast ploughd And on the neck of crowned Fortune proud        Hast reard Gods trophies and his work pursud        While Darwen stream with blood of Scots imbrud        And Dunbar field resounds thy praises loud And Worcesters laureate wreath yet much remains        To conquer still peace hath her victories        No less renownd than war  New foes arise Threatning to bind our souls with secular chains        Help us to save free Conscience from the paw        Of hireling wolves whose gospel is their maw
