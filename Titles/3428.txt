1    season opener
The ants are licking open the peonies
unwrapping the seal to the tight globes
of bloom    they gang up on
and chase away a ladybug
I can sit here    on the porch stoop
as on the step    of an amphitheater
and watch    ours
is a great sports city the tour
guides say   even the house roofs
are bleachers    some ball is always in the air
ready to open    its colors
fragrance like stadium food
scent reaches the street    our mouths drop
open    tongues about to do the work
2
The wind is so high
the lake surface contracts
in a gasp
The waves jump straight up 
Our side must be winning 
I cant hear
the crowd of whitecap I see
from the bus run
The joggers and cyclists
look as though hysterically
they carry
themselves     the news
and breaking sound        that maybe
Theres not another side
to water        nor to the whole of
what we play
We field against a fog
or the home game in solids ice
in a change of uniform
We contend against what is
and is ourselves        though
We want a side that isnt
ours to have of
the universe    to have us on our feet
like the waves cheering on
this morning this morning
We want our messengers
to lie    a pool of good news
dead silent
at our feet for us to walk
open     Our winnings
winning or not still won a life
that lets us live it
the excitement    of winged ankles
seas of dancing streets in the envelope 
3
When the waves jumped straight up the messenger
Sand smashed them to pieces for winning
When the surface fainted back the stampeding
Sky sank its foot in that face to leave winning
There were two countless words for the score
You hear the roar of silence over winning
Someone screaming What are you doing what are you
Doing    Something answers I am winning 
Doing nothing is thrown out the window
To eliminate that way to deal with winning
We burned gridlocked cars in Morse code before
We took off running to say living is winning
Lake Shore Drive reads Chicago is living
life city quoting the song          winning 
4
The whole street     ladies
lay afloat in the gondola
stroll     of their own legs
the daylit lanterns of their dreams
hide inexpressibly their faces made up
with not being in Kansas
they fan with maps
like feathers of brightly colored directions
to famous brands
of which this street is
that one direction      And all one direction
only          no movement 
as if since people move there are no people
on this street the stalks of the buildings reeds
a hem of the lake sweeps through 
5
daylight you see peoples
reflections off each other fill the street
cascading one from another
the crowd slips like a fan out of itself
in the angling of store displays
the glass facets kaleidoscope a rose
window back
of themselves full of the flash petals of grace
that fall by evening home
when the ones dressed in evening
wear        possession-less and so without
reflection here        take all the empties back
all the want and people scavenged back
off the streets     into these who dine with starving    off the streets
6
The street in the opening between buildings
is running a strip of the el like a frame
by frame tape the windows of the train
different shots of the sky then it breaks
and the clouds are caught up in the walls
of nearby glass-skin architecture 
I never get to see what I think
would be the whole movie  I too move on 
The turns in the drive roll the buildings
out from behind one another in a scenery
change only I am the one on wheels
the drop backs a larger stage than this town 
And just as I can see betrayal coming
by the music my eyes braille the thunder
hidden even up the sleeve of a silent
film  The hand shakes anyway  Not meant
to be the end of things  An inbound train
toward the loop will be arriving shortly 
The street in the opening
7
The John Hancock Building has never struck
the actual oil it looks like it should 
Wildcatters call this a dry hole  But it isnt
it has the pool of Lake Michigan
on the bottom when youre looking from the top
What an amazing hole he said  Enchantments name
to call into      what we all are looking for a spell
to an opening as deep     into seeing 
He had the gift of new    first time in a city
pick pockets hadnt sighted yet the eyes
the bulging wealth of openness the shiny change 
We were watching the old movie of our century 
 our village root the wells drawn-words drip
into volumes in our pack trying to solve our plot 
A close-up on the winch-rope frayed
by so continuously raising the question
cuts off    not to mislead the viewer and screened
on our bodies the billboard buses city wall 
the crude that is this day struck from our drilling
8
All over everything    the sun rises funny 
I heard the eagle flies on Friday asthe eagle shits on Friday where I lived 
Not enough for any growth to get paid
its flowers  Mostly weed  Bouquet of distraction 
Broken glass season gives way to plastic
in the lots only the packaging changes
it snows something or other year round
white to deal with powder or rock  Or through
the window the country unable to stop
opening its poverties making the sun go round
to the back  But the sun reserves its someday
someday to shine where door don llow light 
And I am drenched by a slow barely brought in
gusher of my working through the cracks
a gold opened in myself like a vein through
blinding pain through the names of need and silence 
But my someday come seems didnt
when the hit is only mine not also enough of  to my brothers

Dawn burnished
                wave        smoothed free of everything
but the slowest curve
                                barely less than earths
hump      unloads
                 a surf-less silence
we can see 
                                clear bright yet shimmering stillness as 
Stillness as a dangerous surface                    enough
                a floor walked all night
clear to the end of nowhere                     got to get my hands on some
                                 no place          except where
                                                                             money from somewhere
                                                                             to get me over this hump
an arm swipes
                everything off the table to
this floor        the hit bottom come to
                the surface                           on the table
