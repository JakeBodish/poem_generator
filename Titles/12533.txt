
The island’s dark tonight 
The radio crackles with static news
of a blackout the voice
coming through first loud then soft
as if a storm were moving
to cut all lifelines off  My one-room
cabin has a bed a table a chair 
Living this way I understand better
that scene by an anonymous
illuminator a row of monks
eating at a rough table diagonals
of light slicing across the room
to fall as if by accident
on their simple meal  The black
and white tiles on the floor
a symbol of the formal repetitions
of the simplest life or maybe
an oblique allusion to a paradox
of theology the complementary nature
of good and evil  Is evil possible here
where everyone lives so individually
and nature appears to be neutral
toward everything but itself
Some mornings I wake too suddenly
the light on the wall
brilliant and unfamiliar and wonder
for a moment where am I
I answer myself my disembodied voice
high and far off
like what I imagine saints and martyrs
heard in moments of ecstasy Swan’s Island 
Lightheaded I rise make coffee
settling into the simple ceremony
of another morning  Outside the sea birds
pick the clam flats clean fly off
returning late in the afternoon
looking for more to scavenge 
Good days I swim in the quarry
sun myself on the rocks and plan
a diary  One entry I feel
this place to be a rough approximation
of heaven the heaven of the lost
