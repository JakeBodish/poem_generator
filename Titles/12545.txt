
Goethe in Weimar sleeps and GreeceLong since saw Byrons struggle cease But one such death remaind to comeThe last poetic voice is dumb We stand to-day by Wordsworths tomb When Byrons eyes were shut in deathWe bowd our head and held our breath He taught us little but our soulHad felt him like the thunders roll With shivering heart the strife we sawOf passion with eternal lawAnd yet with reverential aweWe watchd the fount of fiery lifeWhich served for that Titanic strife 
    When Goethes death was told we saidSunk then is Europes sagest head Physician of the iron ageGoethe has done his pilgrimage He took the suffering human raceHe read each wound each weakness clearAnd struck his finger on the placeAnd said Thou ailest here and here He lookd on Europes dying hourOf fitful dream and feverish powerHis eye plunged down the weltering strifeThe turmoil of expiring life He said The end is everywhereArt still has truth take refuge thereAnd he was happy if to knowCauses of things and far belowHis feet to see the lurid flowOf terror and insane distressAnd headlong fate be happiness And Wordsworth Ah pale ghosts rejoiceFor never has such soothing voiceBeen to your shadowy world conveydSince erst at morn some wandering shadeHeard the clear song of Orpheus comeThrough Hades and the mournful gloom Wordsworth has gone from us and yeAh may ye feel his voice as weHe too upon a wintry climeHad fallen on this iron timeOf doubts disputes distractions fears He found us when the age had boundOur souls in its benumbing roundHe spoke and loosed our heart in tears He laid us as we lay at birthOn the cool flowery lap of earthSmiles broke from us and we had easeThe hills were round us and the breezeWent oer the sun-lit fields againOur foreheads felt the wind and rain Our youth returnd for there was shedOn spirits that had long been deadSpirits dried up and closely furldThe freshness of the early world Ah since dark days still bring to lightMans prudence and mans fiery mightTime may restore us in his courseGoethes sage mind and Byrons forceBut where will Europes latter hourAgain find Wordsworths healing powerOthers will teach us how to dareAnd against fear our breast to steelOthers will strengthen us to bear But who ah who will make us feelThe cloud of mortal destinyOthers will front it fearlessly But who like him will put it byKeep fresh the grass upon his graveO Rotha with thy living waveSing him thy best for few or noneHears thy voice right now he is gone
