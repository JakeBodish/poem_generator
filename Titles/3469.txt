
If it had worked out Id be on a train to Green Bay
not crawling up this building with the Air Corps
on my ass  And if it werent for love Id drop
this shrieking little bimbo sixty stories
and let them take me back to the exhibit
let them teach me to mambo and do imitations 
They tried me on the offensive line told me
to take out the right cornerback for Nagurski 
Eager to please I wadded up the whole secondary
then stomped the line then the bench and locker room
then the east end of town to the river 
But they were not pleased they said I had to
learn my position become a team player 
The great father Bear himself said that
so I tried hard to know the right numbers
and how the arrows slanted toward the little os 
But the os and the wet grass and the grunts
drowned out the count and the tight little cheers
drew my arrow straight into the stands
and the wives tasted like flowers and raw fish 
So I was put on waivers right after camp
and here I am panty-sniffer about to die a clown
who once opened a hole you could drive Nebraska through
