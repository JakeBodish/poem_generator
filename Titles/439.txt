
The sudden pink shape
surfacing in black-water lagoons
shocked explorers 
All dolphins share man’s
thumb and fingerbones
but these also wear his flesh 
When the river overflows
and floods the varzea 
these dolphins travel miles
to splash in the shallows
amongst buttress-roots of giant
rainforest trees 
The waters abate trapping fish
dolphins never 
 
A lamp burning dolphin oil
blinds  At night
the pink-flesh contours melt and blur 
The flipper extends the hidden hand
to lift its woman’s torso
to the land  An Eve
born each night from the black Amazon
roams the dark banks for victims
to draw to the water and death 
Taboo to the Indians
this pink daughter of the river’s magic
always looks to explorers
like she’s smiling
