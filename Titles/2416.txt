
You and I thigh deep in Suwannee River then in a bathtub  Spanish moss clogs
the drain and a man carrying a green towel interrupts  We send him away once
more knowing hell return to watch  Were photographers shooting on location
for Sylvia Plaths upcoming book Savage Beauty wrong poet or wrong book
I know depending on how you look at it however Im the one who is white
this time youre darker maybe Quechua Indian or Spanish like actor Antonio
Banderas with very defined stomach muscles and a slick throb of a penis 
Years later I write a book about our affair  They bring me on one of those
daytime talk shows and before being reunited we are kept in separate rooms the
television split screen green-towel man in the audience  Im still white so are you
both of us middle-aged with freckles and strawberry-blonde hair  Later Im the
viewer at home thinking Like hell theyll fall for each other
