
Santa needs new reindeer 
The first bunch has grown old 
Dasher has arthritis
Comet hates the cold 
Prancers sick of staring
at Dancers big behind 
Cupid married Blitzen
and Donder lost his mind 
Dancers mad at Vixen
for stepping on his toes 
Vixens being thrown out 
she laughed at Rudolphs nose 
If you are a reindeer
we hope you will apply 
There is just one tricky part
You must know how to fly
