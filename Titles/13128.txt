And with him talkt and with him lodgd I mean Andrew and Simon famous after known With others though in Holy Writ not namd Now missing him thir joy so lately found So lately found and so abruptly gone Began to doubt and doubted many days And as the days increasd increasd thir doubt Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn And for a time caught up to God as once Moses was in the Mount and missing long And the great Thisbite who on fiery wheels Rode up to Heaven yet once again to come  Therefore as those young Prophets then with care Sought lost Eliah so in each place these Nigh to Bethabara in Jerico The City of Palms Ænon and Salem Old Machærus and each Town or City walld On this side the broad lake Genezaret Or in Perea but returnd in vain  Then on the bank of Jordan by a Creek Where winds with Reeds and Osiers whispring play Plain Fishermen no greater men them call Close in a Cottage low together got Thir unexpected loss and plaints out breathd  Alas from what high hope to what relapse Unlookd for are we falln our eyes beheld Messiah certainly now come so long Expected of our Fathers we have heard His words his wisdom full of grace and truth Now now for sure deliverance is at hand The Kingdom shall to Israel be restord Thus we rejoycd but soon our joy is turnd Into perplexity and new amaze For whither is he gone what accident Hath rapt him from us will he now retire After appearance and again prolong Our expectation   God of Israel Send thy Messiah forth the time is come Behold the Kings of the Earth how they oppress Thy chosen to what highth thir powr unjust They have exalted and behind them cast All fear of thee arise and vindicate Thy Glory free thy people from thir yoke But let us wait thus far he hath performd Sent his Anointed and to us reveald him By his great Prophet pointed at and shown In publick and with him we have conversd Let us be glad of this and all our fears Lay on his Providence he will not fail Nor will withdraw him now nor will recall Mock us with his blest sight then snatch him hence Soon we shall see our hope our joy return     Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume To find whom at the first they found unsought But to his Mother Mary when she saw Others returnd from Baptism not her Son Nor left at Jordan tydings of him none Within her brest though calm her brest though pure Motherly cares and fears got head and raisd Some troubld thoughts which she in sighs thus clad     O what avails me now that honour high To have conceivd of God or that salute Hale highly favourd among women blest While I to sorrows am no less advanct And fears as eminent above the lot Of other women by the birth I bore In such a season born when scarce a Shed Could be obtaind to shelter him or me From the bleak air a Stable was our warmth A Manger his yet soon enforct to flye Thence into Egypt till the Murdrous King Were dead who sought his life and missing filld With Infant blood the streets of Bethlehem From Egypt home returnd in Nazareth Hath been our dwelling many years his life Private unactive calm contemplative Little suspicious to any King but now Full grown to Man acknowledgd as I hear By John the Baptist and in publick shown Son ownd from Heaven by his Fathers voice I lookt for some great change to Honour no But trouble as old Simeon plain fore-told That to the fall and rising he should be Of many in Israel and to a sign Spoken against that through my very Soul A sword shall pierce this is my favourd lot My Exaltation to Afflictions high Afflicted I may be it seems and blest I will not argue that nor will repine  But where delays he now some great intent Conceals him when twelve years he scarce had seen I lost him but so found as well I saw He could not lose himself but went about His Fathers business what he meant I musd Since understand much more his absence now Thus long to some great purpose he obscures  But I to wait with patience am inurd My heart hath been a store-house long of things And sayings laid up portending strange events     Thus Mary pondering oft and oft to mind Recalling what remarkably had passd Since first her Salutation heard with thoughts Meekly composd awaited the fulfilling The while her Son tracing the Desert wild Sole but with holiest Meditations fed Into himself descended and at once All his great work to come before him set How to begin how to accomplish best His end of being on Earth and mission high For Satan with slye preface to return Had left him vacant and with speed was gon Up to the middle Region of thick Air Where all his Potentates in Council sate There without sign of boast or sign of joy Sollicitous and blank he thus began     Princes Heavens antient Sons Æthereal Thrones Demonian Spirits now from the Element Each of his reign allotted rightlier calld Powers of Fire Air Water and Earth beneath So may we hold our place and these mild seats Without new trouble such an Enemy Is risn to invade us who no less Threatns then our expulsion down to Hell I as I undertook and with the vote Consenting in full frequence was impowrd Have found him viewd him tasted him but find Far other labour to be undergon Then when I dealt with Adam first of Men Though Adam by his Wives allurement fell However to this Man inferior far If he be Man by Mothers side at least With more then humane gifts from Heaven adornd Perfections absolute Graces divine And amplitude of mind to greatest Deeds  Therefore I am returnd lest confidence Of my success with Eve in Paradise Deceive ye to perswasion over-sure Of like succeeding here I summon all Rather to be in readiness with hand Or counsel to assist lest I who erst Thought none my equal now be over-matchd     So spake the old Serpent doubting and from all With clamour was assurd thir utmost aid At his command when from amidst them rose Belial the dissolutest Spirit that fell The sensuallest and after Asmodai The fleshliest Incubus and thus advisd     Set women in his eye and in his walk Among daughters of men the fairest found Many are in each Region passing fair As the noon Skie more like to Goddesses Then Mortal Creatures graceful and discreet Expert in amorous Arts enchanting tongues Perswasive Virgin majesty with mild And sweet allayd yet terrible to approach Skilld to retire and in retiring draw Hearts after them tangld in Amorous Nets  Such object hath the power to softn and tame Severest temper smooth the ruggedst brow Enerve and with voluptuous hope dissolve Draw out with credulous desire and lead At will the manliest resolutest brest As the Magnetic hardest Iron draws  Women when nothing else beguild the heart Of wisest Solomon and made him build And made him bow to the Gods of his Wives     To whom quick answer Satan thus returnd  Belial in much uneven scale thou weighst All others by thy self because of old Thou thy self doatst on womankind admiring Thir shape thir colour and attractive grace None are thou thinkst but taken with such toys  Before the Flood thou with thy lusty Crew False titld Sons of God roaming the Earth Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men And coupld with them and begot a race  Have we not seen or by relation heard In Courts and Regal Chambers how thou lurkst In Wood or Grove by mossie Fountain side In Valley or Green Meadow to way-lay Some beauty rare Calisto Clymene Daphne or Semele Antiopa Or Amymone Syrinx many more Too long then layst thy scapes on names adord Apollo Neptune Jupiter or Pan Satyr or Fawn or Silvan   But these haunts Delight not all among the Sons of Men How many have with a smile made small account Of beauty and her lures easily scornd All her assaults on worthier things intent Remember that Pellean Conquerour A youth how all the Beauties of the East He slightly viewd and slightly over-passd How hee sirnamd of Africa dismissd In his prime youth the fair Iberian maid  For Solomon he livd at ease and full Of honour wealth high fare aimd not beyond Higher design then to enjoy his State Thence to the bait of Women lay exposd But he whom we attempt is wiser far Then Solomon of more exalted mind Made and set wholly on the accomplishment Of greatest things what woman will you find Though of this Age the wonder and the fame On whom his leisure will vouchsafe an eye Of fond desire or should she confident As sitting Queen adord on Beauties Throne Descend with all her winning charms begirt To enamour as the Zone of Venus once Wrought that effect on Jove so Fables tell How would one look from his Majestick brow Seated as on the top of Vertues hill Discountnance her despisd and put to rout All her array her female pride deject Or turn to reverent awe for Beauty stands In the admiration only of weak minds Led captive cease to admire and all her Plumes Fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy At every sudden slighting quite abasht Therefore with manlier objects we must try His constancy with such as have more shew Of worth of honour glory and popular praise Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreckd Or that which only seems to satisfie Lawful desires of Nature not beyond And now I know he hungers where no food Is to be found in the wide Wilderness The rest commit to me I shall let pass No advantage and his strength as oft assay     He ceasd and heard thir grant in loud acclaim Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band Of Spirits likest to himself in guile To be at hand and at his beck appear If cause were to unfold some active Scene Of various persons each to know his part Then to the Desert takes with these his flight Where still from shade to shade the Son of God After forty days fasting had remaind Now hungring first and to himself thus said     Where will this end four times ten days I have passd Wandring this woody maze and humane food Nor tasted nor had appetite that Fast To Vertue I impute not or count part Of what I suffer here if Nature need not Or God support Nature without repast Though needing what praise is it to endure But now I feel I hunger which declares Nature hath need of what she asks yet God Can satisfie that need some other way Though hunger still remain so it remain Without this bodies wasting I content me And from the sting of Famine fear no harm Nor mind it fed with better thoughts that feed Mee hungring more to do my Fathers will     It was the hour of night when thus the Son Commund in silent walk then laid him down Under the hospitable covert nigh Of Trees thick interwoven there he slept And dreamd as appetite is wont to dream Of meats and drinks Natures refreshment sweet Him thought he by the Brook of Cherith stood And saw the Ravens with their horny beaks Food to Elijah bringing Even and Morn Though ravenous taught to abstain from what they brought He saw the Prophet also how he fled Into the Desert and how there he slept Under a Juniper then how awakt He found his Supper on the coals prepard And by the Angel was bid rise and eat And eat the second time after repose The strength whereof sufficd him forty days Sometimes that with Elijah he partook Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse  Thus wore out night and now the Herald Lark Left his ground-nest high towring to descry The morns approach and greet her with his Song As lightly from his grassy Couch up rose Our Saviour and found all was but a dream Fasting he went to sleep and fasting wakd  Up to a hill anon his steps he reard From whose high top to ken the prospect round If Cottage were in view Sheep-cote or Herd But Cottage Herd or Sheep-cote none he saw Only in a bottom saw a pleasant Grove With chaunt of tuneful Birds resounding loud Thither he bent his way determind there To rest at noon and entrd soon the shade High rooft and walks beneath and alleys brown That opend in the midst a woody Scene Natures own work it seemd Nature taught Art And to a Superstitious eye the haunt Of Wood-Gods and Wood-Nymphs he viewd it round When suddenly a man before him stood Not rustic as before but seemlier clad As one in City or Court or Palace bred And with fair speech these words to him addressd     With granted leave officious I return But much more wonder that the Son of God In this wild solitude so long should bide Of all things destitute and well I know Not without hunger    Others of some note As story tells have trod this Wilderness The Fugitive Bond-woman with her Son Out cast Nebaioth yet found he relief By a providing Angel all the race Of Israel here had famishd had not God Raind from Heaven Manna and that Prophet bold Native of Thebes wandring here was fed Twice by a voice inviting him to eat  Of thee these forty days none hath regard Forty and more deserted here indeed     To whom thus Jesus what concludst thou hence They all had need I as thou seest have none     How hast thou hunger then Satan replyd Tell me if Food were now before thee set Wouldst thou not eat Thereafter as I like The giver answerd Jesus  Why should that Cause thy refusal said the subtle Fiend Hast thou not right to all Created things Owe not all Creatures by just right to thee Duty and Service nor to stay till bid But tender all their power nor mention I Meats by the Law unclean or offerd first To Idols those young Daniel could refuse Nor profferd by an Enemy though who Would scruple that with want opprest behold Nature ashamd or better to express Troubld that thou shouldst hunger hath purveyd From all the Elements her choicest store To treat thee as beseems and as her Lord With honour only deign to sit and eat     He spake no dream for as his words had end Our Saviour lifting up his eyes beheld In ample space under the broadest shade A Table richly spred in regal mode With dishes pilld and meats of noblest sort And savour Beasts of chase or Fowl of game In pastry built or from the spit or boyld Gris-amber-steamd all Fish from Sea or Shore Freshet or purling Brook of shell or fin And exquisitest name for which was draind Pontus and Lucrine Bay and Afric Coast  Alas how simple to these Cates compard Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve And at a stately side-board by the wine That fragrant smell diffusd in order stood Tall stripling youths rich clad of fairer hew Then Ganymed or Hylas distant more Under the Trees now tripd now solemn stood Nymphs of Dianas train and Naiades With fruits and flowers from Amaltheas horn And Ladies of th Hesperides that seemd Fairer then feignd of old or fabld since Of Fairy Damsels met in Forest wide By Knights of Logres or of Lyones Lancelot or Pelleas or Pellenore And all the while Harmonious Airs were heard Of chiming strings or charming pipes and winds Of gentlest gale Arabian odors fannd From their soft wings and Floras earliest smells  Such was the Splendour and the Tempter now His invitation earnestly renewd     What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat These are not Fruits forbidden no interdict Defends the touching of these viands pure Thir taste no knowledge works at least of evil But life preserves destroys lifes enemy Hunger with sweet restorative delight  All these are Spirits of Air and Woods and Springs Thy gentle Ministers who come to pay Thee homage and acknowledge thee thir Lord What doubtst thou Son of God sit down and eat     To whom thus Jesus temperately replyd Saidst thou not that to all things I had right And who withholds my powr that right to use Shall I receive by gift what of my own When and where likes me best I can command I can at will doubt not as soon as thou Command a Table in this Wilderness And call swift flights of Angels ministrant Arrayd in Glory on my cup to attend Why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence In vain where no acceptance it can find And with my hunger what has thou to do Thy pompous Delicacies I contemn And count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles     To whom thus answerd Satan malecontent That I have also power to give thou seest If of that powr I bring thee voluntary What I might have bestowd on whom I pleasd And rather opportunely in this place Chose to impart to thy apparent need Why shouldst thou not accept it but I see What I can do or offer is suspect Of these things others quickly will dispose Whose pains have earnd the far fet spoil  With that Both Table and Provision vanishd quite With sound of Harpies wings and Talons heard Only the importune Tempter still remaind And with these words his temptation pursud     By hunger that each other Creature tames Thou art not to be harmd therefore not movd Thy temperance invincible besides For no allurement yields to appetite And all thy heart is set on high designs High actions but wherewith to be atchievd Great acts require great means of enterprise Thou art unknown unfriended low of birth A Carpenter thy Father known thy self Bred up in poverty and streights at home Lost in a Desert here and hunger-bit Which way or from what hope dost thou aspire To greatness whence Authority derivst What Followers what Retinue canst thou gain Or at thy heels the dizzy Multitude Longer then thou canst feed them on thy cost Money brings Honour Friends Conquest and Realms What raisd Antipater the Edomite And his Son Herod placd on Judas Throne Thy throne but gold that got him puissant friends Therefore if at great things thou wouldst arrive Get Riches first get Wealth and Treasure heap Not difficult if thou hearken to me Riches are mine Fortune is in my hand They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain While Virtue Valour Wisdom sit in want     To whom thus Jesus patiently replyd Yet Wealth without these three is impotent To gain dominion or to keep it gaind  Witness those antient Empires of the Earth In highth of all thir flowing wealth dissolvd But men endud with these have oft attaind In lowest poverty to highest deeds Gideon and Jephtha and the Shepherd lad Whose off-spring on the Throne of Juda sat So many Ages and shall yet regain That seat and reign in Israel without end  Among the Heathen for throughout the World To me is not unknown what hath been done Worthy of Memorial canst thou not remember Quintius Fabricius Curius Regulus For I esteem those names of men so poor Who could do mighty things and could contemn Riches though offerd from the hand of Kings  And what in me seems wanting but that I May also in this poverty as soon Accomplish what they did perhaps and more Extol not Riches then the toyl of Fools The wise mans cumbrance if not snare more apt To slacken Virtue and abate her edge Then prompt her to do aught may merit praise  What if with like aversion I reject Riches and Realms yet not for that a Crown Golden in shew is but a wreath of thorns Brings dangers troubles cares and sleepless nights To him who wears the Regal Diadem When on his shoulders each mans burden lies For therein stands the office of a King His Honour Vertue Merit and chief Praise That for the Publick all this weight he bears  Yet he who reigns within himself and rules Passions Desires and Fears is more a King Which every wise and vertuous man attains And who attains not ill aspires to rule Cities of men or head-strong Multitudes Subject himself to Anarchy within Or lawless passions in him which he serves  But to guide Nations in the way of truth By saving Doctrine and from errour lead To know and knowing worship God aright Is yet more Kingly this attracts the Soul Governs the inner man the nobler part That other ore the body only reigns And oft by force which to a generous mind So reigning can be no sincere delight  Besides to give a Kingdom hath been thought Greater and nobler done and to lay down Far more magnanimous then to assume  Riches are needless then both for themselves And for thy reason why they should be sought To gain a Scepter oftest better misst
