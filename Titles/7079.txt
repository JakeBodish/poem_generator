
I joy dear mother when I viewThy perfect lineaments and hue
   Both sweet and bright Beauty in thee takes up her placeAnd dates her letters from thy face
   When she doth write 
 A fine aspect in fit arrayNeither too mean nor yet too gay
   Shows who is best Outlandish looks may not compareFor all they either painted are
   Or else undressd 
 She on the hills which wantonlyAllureth all in hope to be
   By her preferrdHath kissd so long her painted shrinesThat evn her face by kissing shines
   For her reward 
 She in the valley is so shyOf dressing that her hair doth lie
   About her earsWhile she avoids her neighbours prideShe wholly goes on th other side
   And nothing wears 
 But dearest mother what those missThe mean thy praise and glory is
   And long may be Blessed be God whose love it wasTo double-moat thee with his grace
   And none but thee
