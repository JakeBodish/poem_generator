
how much of the map
               could be labeled
                              terra incognita
how much        unknown        invisible to others
        how much of myself    could I shake off
abandon               those undiscovered places
               I barely know        exist
        though the map is not the territory
how I am drawn        to leave behind the pattern
               for the path        for a minute
                          an hour        for one whole day
Id be like a Wintu               describing the body
               using cardinal directionshe touches me on the west arm
                                        the river is to the east                     when we return          his east arm
circles around me        and the river
                             stays to the west
