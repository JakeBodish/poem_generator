
You made me cry in cruel stationsSo I missed many trains  You married others In plausible buildings  The subsequent sonBecame my boss  You promised me nothingBut blamed me for doubting when who wouldn’t If  I knew how to please you   who have found Out my faults  In dreams I’m wild with guilt  Have pityKill it  Then when I’ve lost all hopeKiss me again your mouth so open   I’d give anything for one more night   That I go without thought  Don’t bite  NoMark me  My husband already knowsExactly what owns me
