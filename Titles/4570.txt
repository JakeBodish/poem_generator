Yes I am a body of rags lying
here on the bridge waiting for
a hot rain to wash me open
dissolve me off the bridge
because this border is closed 
I rot on the boundary line
and can’t enter Juarez
pennies thrown at me
when a drunk El Pasoan
returns in the darkness
and sees my shape that
makes him hurry across 
No head decades ago they threw
it in the river without my screams 
My arms were the first to go
when I couldn’t climb the wall 
I can never leave this bridge 
I live on the pure line that divides
countries and grabs my hunger
from sliding into Mexico with
my outstretched hands 
I still have my knees 
I used to be sold in Juarez and
smuggled into El Paso the egg
that floated down the Rio Grande
to break hundreds of miles away
before being thrown back 
I stay on the bridge and can’t move 
Do not cross to El Paso without wiping
your shoes of me one foot on US
concrete the other scraping away
at my Mexican rags 
When I struggle against the wire fence
I make sure I salute two flags
