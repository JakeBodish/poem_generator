
I hustleupstream 
I grasp I grind 
I control  panic  Poke
balloons in my chest
always popping there
always my thoughts thump
thump  I snooze   wake  go
boom  All day like this I short
my breath  I scroll  scroll 
I see what you wrote   I like 
I heart  My thumb so tired 
My head bent down but not
in prayer heavy from the looking 
I see your face your phone-lit
faces  I tap your food two times
for more hearts  I retweet 
I email yes  yes  yes 
Then I cry  need to say no-no-no 
Why does it take so long to reply
I FOMO  shout  I read  I never
enough  New book  New post 
New ping  A new tab then another 
Papers on the floor scattered  stacked 
So many journals unbroken white spines
waiting  Did you hear that new new
I start to text back  Ellipsis then I forget 
I balk  I lazy the bed  I wallow when I write 
I truth when I lie  I throw a book
when a poem undoes me  I underline
Clifton today we are possible  I start
from image  I begin with Phillis Wheatley 
I begin with Phillis Wheatley  I begin
with Phillis Wheatley reaching for coal 
I start with a napkin receipt or my hand 
I muscle memory  I stutter the page  I fail 
Hit delete   scratch out one more line  I sonnet
then break form  I make tea use two bags 
Rooibos again  I bathe now  Epsom salt 
No books or phone  Just water  the sound
of water filling glory   be my buoyant body
bowl of me  Yes lavender more bubbles
 bath bomb of course some candles too 
All alone with Coltrane  My favorite “Naima”
for his wife now for me inside my own womb 
Again I child back  I float  I sing  I simple
 humble  Eyes close  I low my voice
was it a psalm Don’t know  But I stopped
