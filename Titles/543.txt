
In the evening she comes to me
like a child ready for bed 
She slips under covers curls
into my curves or stretches against
my spine  Some have said they fear
I might crush her but were a tender
pair each aware of the warmth
and the other 
 
I knew a woman once who kept
an orphaned antelope let it
roam her kitchen sleep in her bed
musky scent and hooves 
 
This dog looks like a small deer
poised and silent in the lawn
but at night she is a dark body lean
and long against the lavender cotton
of my summer sleeping  We are bone
and bone muscle and muscle
and underneath each surface
a quiet and insistent pulse
