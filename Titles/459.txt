
           We had a grief
we didnt understand while
           standing at the edge of
   some low scrub hills as if
humans were extra
   or already gone 
 
what had been in us before
          a life that asks for mostly
    wanting freedom to get things done
in order to feel less
          helpless about the end
of things alone 
 
when i think of time on earth
   i feel the angle of gray minutes
          entering the medium days
    yet not built-up our
work together groups the willing
    burden of an old belief
 
            beyond them love as of
    a great life going like fast
creatures peeling back marked
    seeds gold-brown integuments
    the color time
  will be when we are gone
