
Why and by whose power were you sent
What do you see that you may wish to steal
Why this dancing Why do your dark bodies
Drink up all the light What are you demanding
That we feel Have you stolen something Then
What is that leaping in your chest What is
The nature of your mission Do you seek
To offer a confession Have you anything to do
With others brought by us to harm Then
Why are you afraid And why do you invade
Our night hands raised eyes wide mute
As ghosts Is there something you wish to confess
Is this some enigmatic type of test What if we
Fail How and to whom do we address our appeal
