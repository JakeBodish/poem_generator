
Dear Tourists
You can grope for moist souvenirs in the basement
but youll need patience
because nobody down there will warn you about the floor 
In the street youll find squirrels on my scalp bumps 
If you want proof for the folks back home that youve surged
like a seagull print your name and number in the bathroom 
If you want a seagull for a pet talk to my therapist 
If you find her tell me where she lives and where her daughter
goes to school  If you want a piece of me suck my dick 
If you want to sell trips to the general public take my pulse
or my coffee-table picture-books about Italy 
If theres a house in the trees throw up a hammer
and see what falls down  The bleeding kid isnt
the best prize and you cant return it so be careful where
you walk when youve had a few 
If theres a nettle between your shoulder blades
and youre having trouble breathing tell the teacher
but dont tell her it was me cause it wasnt 
I was just watching maybe even laughing at your gurgling sounds 
That incident belongs to somebody elses amusement park 
I dont ever want to see it again on this side of the blunt tracks
