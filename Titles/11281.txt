
Yes Ive been in Rome at least two timesthough on second thought it probably wasthree or maybe five  When was the lastThats easy for I remember it exactly at least what it was like when I first left You mean a part of you remains in RomeNot really for when I was first in RomeI was truly there  That ended the second timethough I only realized it when I first left So when you were in Rome your last time wasconsumed by thoughts of leaving Not exactly As time went on I came around at lastthinking obsess about leaving and nothing lastsIll end up never having been in Rome Yet back then did you know just what exactlyit meant to be in Rome during that timeyou thought about leaving even if it wasthen you saw what youd lose if you had leftEven at the time when I first leftId no idea  But youre not saying the lastyou saw of Rome was your third visit for wasntit earlier that you felt youd never leave RomeNo all that happened there my second timethough to this day I feel about Rome exactlywhat I felt from the first  What that means exactlyis hard to say for perhaps I never leftsince after all my being there the first timedidnt involve my leaving  Tell me then at lastwas it once or twice were you really in RomeWhy certainly Im sure I know I wasand on top of that you might even say I wasthere time and again everything there exactlyjust the same or like my last time in Romeme feeling as if Id never really left But tell me now precisely was the lastyou saw of Rome indeed that second timeTo be exact it happened the very first timethat I saw Rome darkness falling as I leftcausing me to see what simply couldnt last
