
Thy country Wilberforce with just disdainHears thee by cruel men and impious calldFanatic for thy zeal to loose th enthralldFrom exile public sale and slavrys chain Friend of the poor the wrongd the fetter-galldFear not lest labour such as thine be vainThou hast achievd a part hast gaind the earOf Britains senate to thy glorious causeHope smiles joy springs and tho cold caution pauseAnd weave delay the better hour is nearThat shall remunerate thy toils severeBy peace for Afric fencd with British laws 
   Enjoy what thou hast won esteem and love
   From all the just on earth and all the blest above
