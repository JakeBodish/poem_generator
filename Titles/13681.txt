
I as sinned against as sinning take small pleasure from the winning of our decades-long guerrilla war  For from my job Ive wanted more than victory over one whod tried to punish me before he died and now neither of us dead we haunt these halls in constant dread of drifting past the others life while long-term memory is rife with slights that sting like paper cuts  Weve occupied our separate ruts yet simmered in a single rage  Weve grown absurd in middle age together and should seek wisdom now together by ending this row  I therefore decommission you as constant flagship of my rue  Below the threshold of my hate you now my good regard may rate  For I have let my anger pass  But while youre down there kiss my ass
