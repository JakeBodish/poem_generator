
How much delight before we collapse
How much earth in the lungs
How much wine
When we want more
When the weeds sprawl
It is not what you think
Think how fast some landscapes change
the lover the gardeners grand idea
the failing Maple
the boat about to capsize
the correction
the hands reflection
the impossible replication of weight
versus time
how it will never mean what you want
