
This is a demon that can take a grown brain and squash it to sponge  There is no loving the state
of a decrepit mind that encourages a decrepit body  Is he sleeping or just not there States of
awareness flicker inside a gauzy lens  We’ve seen this before in a film the man disappearing
as he stands right there his body stolid 
 
Let’s say this man worked as an Assistant Principal and admired his own IQ 
Let’s say this man had a brutish body but was not a brute  All of this becomes portraiture but
there can be fractures of truth   Looking at him you think Am I in this film or is this a vapory
memory
