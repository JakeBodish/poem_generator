Having returned at last and being carefully seated
On the floor somebody elses floor as usual 
Far away across that ocean which looked
Through Newport windows years ago somebody elses livingroom 
Another messed-up weedy garden
Tall floppy improbably red flowers
All the leaves turned over in the rain
Ridged furry scrotum veins
Hedges glisten tile roof tin roof telephone pole
Decoratively tormented black pine
Slowly repeating its careful program
Endlessly regretting but here is original done once
Not to be reproduced nor electronically remembered

An enormous drop of pure water suddenly there
Right in the center of preceding page
Nothing can be done about that  The line was ruined  OK 
Belt hair  A bend is funnier  Bar Kochba  Do something

Let your sister ride the bike a while
Dont be so damned selfish
How can Victorian American lady
Explain to her son that his cock
Doesnt belong exclusively to himself
But also to certain future women
Its a matter of some reassurance
That we are physically indistinguishable from other men 
When introspection shows us
That we have different degrees of intelligence
Varying capacities for knowing morality
We lose something of our complacency

From the Institute
I wondered recently what school was being lampooned
In this impudent snatch of gradeschool melody
Recollection of obscene  early childhood 
If Socrates and Plato and Diotima
And all the rest of the folks at that party
Had simply eaten lots of food and wine and dope
And spent the entire weekend in bed together
Perhaps Western Civilization
Wouldnt have been such a failure

Much of the morning sweeping consists of clearing away
Bodies of several hundred insects who followed my lightglobes

In all his past existences  What a system 
Hi-de-ho

A warped red plastic phonograph record the labels saysEmperor Concerto floats on top inaudible
Nevertheless light comes through it in a pleasant way

We have been introduced to each other once every ten years
For a very long time  He has no reason to remember meeting
Me since the conversation is limited to how do you do
And hes considerably taller than I am 
I think all the time I cant forgive him
For jamming that nk sound against the initial C
Nor for the blackmail word truly
I cant stop thinking about    
I keep thinking all the time about those
Absolutely splendid

All ignorantly we project our own savagery  cannibalism
Upon societies and individuals who were   
Our civilized ancestors
Christ now returns under the name U S A 
Rages wild across the earth to avenge himself
Napalm and nuclear bombs for every insult
Every prick of thorn crown
“Not peace but a sword”         Curious elision 
Lays about him burning and smashing
Murdering the Sea
         The war continues because it is profitable 
         It’s making good money for those who had
         Money to invest in it from the beginning
Curious elision for all who did not 
All of   a sudden it became as if nothing had happened   
And that was the end 
Babies we creep out of water sack
Hid there by young men
Old we slide into firebox
Drift up the flue to heaven
A natural history  A narrow escape
What happened  Walked to local coffeeshop
Tomato juice  Start home via Ninnaji templegrounds
People chanting in front of magic Fudo spring
I went to look at the Mie-do then realized   
I was sick or at least beleaguered by creep vibrations
Clearly time for magical cure 
I poured water over Fudo his rocky image
Chanted his mantra and bowed  I also rubbed
Magic water on my head  Old lady caretaker
Delighted       she said I had done well and wished
For my rapid recovery 
To enforce the cure I visited Fudo spring at
Kiyomizudera the Kwannon and other Buddhas there
Expensive tempura lunch with view of Chion In
The Eastern Mountains and a glimpse of Momoyama Castle
Glimpse has a marvelous sound like limpkin and Temko
“That Fudo a good old boy he from Texas”
Shinshindo Coffee house brick fountain
Stone tree new leaves now a new electrical   
Garden lamp on metal pole as in Mrs Blah’s patiobarbecue   
“area”
Chagrin Falls Ohio  The latest incarnation of
The Frog Child tries to ride minute red tricycle
That groans and squeals  Delicious croissants 
I can still feel happy here  How come 
I’m too fond of eggplant ever to be allowed into Heaven
But imagine celestial brinjal  aubergines du paradis
ANACHRONISM
         a homesick for one of
             the chief cities of Ohio
         b process for correcting chromatic
             aberration in camera and other lenses
One of the most wonderful and magical actions
We can perform         Let something alone  Refuse
To allow yourself the pleasure of messing it up 
The things appear to want adjusting improving
Cleaning up c  APPEARS so to us
But as a collection of “event particles”
A section of the Universe as a noisy morning c
Leave it alone  Don’t tamper with it 
Free of that poor-ass Oregon down-home history
As this clear water streaming over head eyes face
I can see hollyhocks ten feet high sideways
To go and to stay illusory
I flee pale music
                        I know what I’m doing NIGHT  DAY
I flee Death’s pale music
                                  Well what
Fleeing Death’s proud music
“Get up out of there” my father used to say
“You can’t sleep your life away 
People die in bed ” But I am tired of all the world
With notebook and pen I hurl myself deep among
The dopey sheets to bed and lock the gates
Shopping among the sand at the bottom of a birdcage
Every grain a universe designed by Walter Lantz
Nonskid never-fail plastic whose colors fade
All surfaces dim and grubby all of them scraped
Minutely scored cracked and flawed
Material impervious to most chemicals
Resistant to ordinary wear

The canary in residence is terribly   
Intelligent and infested with mites 
“Rooty-toot-toot” was the sound of the little  44
Frankie wasted her faithless lover
Whenever I asked people what all that meant
They said “Never mind” –
“Row the boat Norman row”
Hot weather erodes my powers
At the Ishiyamadera small room with bo-leaf window
For the viewing of the moon the priest explains 
She looks at the moon through that window that you see
Over there  She is now a wax dummy with a face
That exhibits what the Japanese think of as “refined”
Features  All dressed up in Heian court robes
Long black hair down her back  In the antechamber
A smaller dummy represents girl-child attendant
Grinding ink at a large inkstone
The figure of Murasaki holds a writing brush
And a long piece of paper  Her head has begun to turn
Away from the writing to observe the moon
And quite likely to remark upon the song of the uguisu
Scholars Japanese and Western say she never did
Never was here a minute  The priest shows
A sutra copied out in Murasakis own handwriting
Heres the very inkstone that she used 
There is the moonlight window
Dog days ten years I try to remember your face
You disappear all my head can see
Are two paintings and drawings in red ink
Whatever else Ive done with my life
Amounts to nothing
But inside the lantern a white speckled black beetle
Not quite as large as a rice-bird gives
Complete performance of Siegfried all alone
I am a hunting and gathering culture
The Moselle wine-boat sails over icy Delaware
On gossamer wing through the woods to Skye
Hurrah for Miss Flora MacDonald
Under the shadow of those trees
Edge of typhoon sudden rain
Shelter at Bashos Rakushisha hut
Green persimmons next door to Princess Uchiko her tomb
Famous for her Chinese poems first priestess of Kamo Shrine
Under the shadow of those trees waiting for the boatCythère
