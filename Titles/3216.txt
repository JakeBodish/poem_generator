
On Mothers Day it isnt smart
To give your mom a broken heart 
So here are thing you shouldnt say
To dear old mom on Mothers Day
Dont tell here that youll never eat
A carrot celery bean or beet 
Dont tell her you think smokings cool 
Dont tell her youve dropped out of school 
Dont tell her that youve drowned the cat 
Dont tell her that she looks too fat 
Dontt tell her when youre grown youll be
A starving poet just like me
