Im coming up out of the tomb Men of War Just when you thought you had me down in place hidden Im coming up now Can you feel the ground rumble under your feet Its breaking apart its turning over its pushing up Its thrusting into your point of view your private property O Men of War Censorious Ones get ready big boys get ready Im coming up now Im coming up with all that was hidden Get ready Big Boys get ready Im coming up with all you wanted buried All the hermetic texts with stories in them of hot  dangerous women Women with lascivious tongues sharp eyes  claws Ive been working out my muscles are strong Im pushing up the earth with all you try to censor All the iconoclasm  bravado you scorn All the taunts against your banner  salute Im coming up from Hell with all you ever suppressed All the dark fantasies all the dregs are coming back Im leading them back up now Theyre going to bark  scoff  rage  bite Im opening the box  boo
