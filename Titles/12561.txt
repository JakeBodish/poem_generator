
O Liberty God-gifted 
   Young and immortal maid In your high hand uplifted
   The torch declares your trade Its crimson menace flaming
   Upon the sea and shoreIs trumpet-like proclaiming
   That Law shall be no more Austere incendiary
   Were blinking in the lightWhere is your customary
   Grenade of dynamiteWhere are your staves and switches
   For men of gentle birthYour mask and dirk for riches
   Your chains for wit and worthPerhaps youve brought the halters
   You used in the old daysWhen round religions altars
   You stabled Cromwells baysBehind you unsuspected
   Have you the axe fair wenchWherewith you once collected
   A poll-tax for the FrenchAmerica salutes you 
   Preparing to disgorge Take everything that suits you
   And marry Henry George
