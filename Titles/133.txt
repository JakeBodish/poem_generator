
Spoiler alert in this all-but-forgotten
masterwork Jean Stafford who was once
widely regarded as the leading novelist
 
of her generation and who wrote
this perverse short
lyrical novel her second during
 
the flailing failings
of her marriage to my hero
Robert Lowell kills
 
Molly her child-alter ego
a girl too unloved and unloving
to survive puberty too
 
pure and awful like Stafford who died
pickled and childish three
decades later after winning
 
the Pulitzer with her devastating
hurtfully compassionate Collected Stories for this or any other world
 
especially the necessarily
allegorical one of fiction 
I am broken now hopeless hope
 
is proved by this book to be
a contrivance  I have just
read the last pages in which
 
Molly’s brother Ralph who
to live cannot love
either has no spare love shoots
 
her aiming for the wild mountain
lion whose stuffed corpse
was to be the triumph
 
of his new manhood  I don’t
hate Ralph how can I a boy
mistaken like me And can I hate
 
Molly who so needed Ralph
and everyone still young enough to savor
the bittersweet of her anger
 
What about Stafford who hurt
herself all our selves with
this ending her classic tragedy writing
 
decades later Poor old Molly I loved her dearly and I hope she rests in peace 
 
Fuck insight and analysis
my heart is shot  Why
did she have to die Why does
 
anyone Why do you do I
Because of what Ralph was
feeling just before he accidentally
 
slaughtered the future This book
must have ravaged the already
sleepless poet Gregory Orr
 
who shot his brother too and
suffers that endless error
in poetry and prose  And because Molly
 
refused everything she stood between
Ralph and tomorrow  But he grew he
changed  Confused Read
 
the book  In novels
people die because of what they feel 
In life people die when
 
their bodies conk out
exhausted machines that living
expends  And what
 
happens when people feel
their feelings in life
Nothing Anything Brenda
 
dear Brenda my love nothing
happens I’m afraid  I’m sorry  And afraid 
A small breeze born in the heart
 
gently bends a blade of grass
and no one hears a word 
No one reads Stafford anymore I asked
 
on Facebook  Stafford died her
legacy gently dispatched
into the low air  O life
 
is terrible literature
ridiculous  Stafford’s prose
teeming and rich as loam
 
could take Famous Franzen’s
for a walk feed it biscuits 
But who cares Who remembers
 
O to have been Jean Stafford
in the past I idealize when the world
was less self-conscious less
 
precise  I could be
dead already warmish
beneath a blanket of dust  Joyful
 
are the faded the once-greats
whose afterlives slipped out
a hole in posteritys pocket
 
they are loved poignantly by
a needy few  O to be kept
cozy in the bosoms of those
 
desperate and proud forgotten
for all the good I do  Love
is sunlight streaming unevenly
 
through the canopy of leaves
overhead  We can only grow
in the brighter patches below fading
 
where light is thin  Molly
we are with you nowhere and gone 
Mostly we are forgotten too
