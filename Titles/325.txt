
I never said I loved you John
        Why will you tease me day by day
And wax a weariness to think upon
        With always do and pray
You know I never loved you John
        No fault of mine made me your toast
Why will you haunt me with a face as wan
        As shows an hour-old ghost
I dare say Meg or Moll would take
        Pity upon you if youd ask
And pray dont remain single for my sake
        Who cant perform that task 
I have no heart Perhaps I have not
        But then youre mad to take offence
That I dont give you what I have not got
        Use your common sense 
Let bygones be bygones
        Dont call me false who owed not to be true
Id rather answer No to fifty Johns
        Than answer Yes to you 
Lets mar our pleasant days no more
        Song-birds of passage days of youth
Catch at to-day forget the days before
        Ill wink at your untruth 
Let us strike hands as hearty friends
        No more no less and friendships good
Only dont keep in view ulterior ends
        And points not understood
In open treaty  Rise above
        Quibbles and shuffling off and on
Heres friendship for you if you like but love 
        No thank you John
