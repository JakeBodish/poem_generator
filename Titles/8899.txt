
wolves of music weave their way at a run
hawthorns wheeze with clandestine laughter
turning a new leaf tides out
young ship-captains high up on balconies
look far away through telescopes
east and west
a single fruit cut into halves
beneath a tree grown from the pit I once spit out
Ive hung nets to
trap birds and waited how many years
