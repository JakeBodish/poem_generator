
1  Morning of Crystal
This is the deathless body and this
the land’s blood … and here the wine-laced sky
over Iowa resembles a heavenly parfait 
In one more day Des Moines
will be diapered by first snow  A young girl
barely real glazes the sidewalk
with a stupid look  Iowa in winter always
dumbfounds the love in us 
Before long nothing opposes the weight and resolution
of this sky this wilderness of earth
hardening  When heaviness strikes like a clock
glowing incandescently the season
opens to itself as if a familiar stunt
in a traveling show a fabulation only
a touched young girl can devise for any new world 
                                              Des Moines  November 19732  Cooking the Cold
