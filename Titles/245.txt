
In those days though I never analysed
Myself even  All analysis comes late 
You catch a sight of Nature earliest
In full front sun-face and your eyelids wink
And drop before the wonder of ‘t you miss
The form through seeing the light  I lived those days
And wrote because I lived–unlicensed else
My heart beat in my brain  Life’s violent flood
Abolished bounds–and which my neighbour’s field
Which mine what mattered It is so in youth 
We play at leap-frog over the god Term
The love within us and the love without
Are mixed confounded if we are loved or love
We scarce distinguish  So with other power 
Being acted on and acting seem the same
In that first onrush of life’s chariot-wheels
We know not if the forests move or we 
And so like most young poets in a flush
Of individual life I poured myself
Along the veins of others and achieved
Mere lifeless imitations of life verse
And made the living answer for the dead
Profaning nature  ‘Touch not do not taste
Nor handle’–we’re too legal who write young
We beat the phorminx till we hurt our thumbs
As if still ignorant of counterpoint
We call the Muse     ‘O Muse benignant Muse’–
As if we had seen her purple-braided head 
With the eyes in it start between the boughs
As often as a stag’s  What make-believe
With so much earnest what effete results
From virile efforts what cold wire-drawn odes
From such white heats–bucolics where the cows
Would scare the writer if they splashed the mud
In lashing off the flies–didactics driven
Against the heels of what the master said
And counterfeiting epics shrill with trumps
A babe might blow between two straining cheeks
Of bubbled rose to make his mother laugh
And elegiac griefs and songs of love
Like cast-off nosegays picked up on the road
The worse for being warm all these things writ
On happy mornings with a morning heart
That leaps for love is active for resolve
Weak for art only  Oft the ancient forms
Will thrill indeed in carrying the young blood 
The wine-skins now and then a little warped
Will crack even as the new wine gurgles in 
Spare the old bottles–spill not the new wine 
By Keats’s soul the man who never stepped
In gradual progress like another man
But turning grandly on his central self
Ensphered himself in twenty perfect years
And died not young–the life of a long life
Distilled to a mere drop falling like a tear
Upon the world’s cold cheek to make it burn
For ever by that strong excepted soul
I count it strange and hard to understand
That nearly all young poets should write old
That Pope was sexagenarian at sixteen
And beardless Byron academical
And so with others  It may be perhaps
Such have not settled long and deep enough
In trance to attain to clairvoyance–and still
The memory mixes with the vision spoils
And works it turbid 
                  Or perhaps again
In order to discover the Muse-Sphinx
The melancholy desert must sweep round
Behind you as before –
For me I wrote
False poems like the rest and thought them true 
Because myself was true in writing them 
I peradventure have writ true ones since
With less complacence 
                    But I could not hide
My quickening inner life from those at watch 
They saw a light at a window now and then
They had not set there  Who had set it there
My father’s sister started when she caught
My soul agaze in my eyes  She could not say
I had no business with a sort of soul
But plainly she objected–and demurred
That souls were dangerous things to carry straight
Through all the spilt saltpetre of the world 
She said sometimes ‘Aurora have you done
Your task this morning–have you read that book
And are you ready for the crochet here’–
As if she said ‘I know there’s something wrong
I know I have not ground you down enough
To flatten and bake you to a wholesome crust
For household uses and proprieties
Before the rain has got into my barn
And set the grains a-sprouting  What you’re green
With out-door impudence you almost grow’
To which I answered ‘Would she hear my task
And verify my abstract of the book
And should I sit down to the crochet work
Was such her pleasure’     Then I sate and teased
The patient needle til it split the thread
Which oozed off from it in meandering lace
From hour to hour  I was not therefore sad
My soul was singing at a work apart
Behind the wall of sense as safe from harm
As sings the lark when sucked up out of sight
In vortices of glory and blue air 
And so through forced work and spontaneous work
The inner life informed the outer life
Reduced the irregular blood to settled rhythms
Made cool the forehead with fresh-sprinkling dreams
And rounding to the spheric soul the thin
Pined body struck a colour up the cheeks
Though somewhat faint  I clenched my brows across
My blue eyes greatening in the looking-glass
And said ‘We’ll live Aurora we’ll be strong 
The dogs are on us–but we will not die ’
