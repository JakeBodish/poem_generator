
Watching the dark my spirit rose in flood   On that most dearest Prelude of my delight The low-lying mist lifted its hood   The October stars showed nobly in clear night When I return and to real music-making   And play that Prelude how will it happen thenShall I feel as I felt a sentry hardly waking   With a dull sense of No Mans Land again
