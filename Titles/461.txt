            very tired      i think
 of extremophiles       chemolithoautotrophs
        others with     power for changing
    not-life into lives      of those that eat rock
 fire in volcanoes        before the death
 of the world but after   the death of a human
                                  of their taste
for ammonia or iron       sulfur  carbon
                                somehow
 enough of it to go on         As workers
          taste revolt          they grow
at the vents of oceans        turning mute vapor
into respiration               changing unhinged
   matter to hinges          near the rims of sea
trenches or the caves             Our friend wrote
    of writers living              in gray hiding
                                 of those who love glass
     early freedom       steep sand
   late freedom            sex among gentle
     or bitter grasses        those with a taste for
 blue or belligerence      obscure lives she
called them                  the writers
    of radical mind     …
The living prefer life      mostly they do
                            they are ravenous
                             making shapes in groups
    as the dying grow     one thought
          until the end    wanting more
              specifics      desert or delay 
          until the i        drops away into          i am not here    the mineral other
pumps  vast vapors      ridges  shadows beyond
            the single life it had not thought of
