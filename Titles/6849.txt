She arrived as near to virginal
as girls got in those days i e  young
the requisite dewy cheek
flushed at its own daring 
He had hoped for a little more edge 
But she held the newspaper rolled like a scepter
his advertisement turned up to prove
she was there solely at his bidding and yet
the gold band the photographs     a mother then 
He placed her in the old garden chair
the same one he went to evenings
when the first tug on the cord sent the bulb
swinging like the lamps in the medic’s tent
over the wounded swaddled shapes that moaned
each time the Screaming Meemies let loose
their calculated shrieks so far away
he thought of crickets while all around him
matted gauze and ether pricked up
an itch so bad he could hardly sketch
each clean curve of tissue opening I shut my eyes walk straight to it 
Nothing special but it’s there wicker
fraying under my calming fingers
