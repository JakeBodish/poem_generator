
Prairie winds blaze through her tumbled belly and Emmett’s
red yesterdays refuse to rename her any kind of mother 
A pudge-cheeked otherwise sugar whistler her boy is
through the fierce clenching mouth of her memory a
grays-and-shadows child  Listen  Once she was pretty 
Windy hues goldened her skin  She was pert brown-faced
in every wide way the opposite of the raw screeching thing
chaos has crafted  Now threaded awkwardly she tires of thesorries the Lawd have mercies  Grief’s damnable tint
is everywhere darkening days she is no longer aware of 
She is gospel revolving repeatedly emptied of light pulled
and caressed cooed upon by strangers offered pork and taffy 
Boys in the street stare at her then avert their eyes as if she
killed them all shipped every one into the grips of Delta  She sits
her chair carefully balanced on hell’s edge and pays for sanity in
kisses upon the conjured forehead of her son  Beginning with A
she recites angry away awful the alphabet of a world gone red 
Coffee scorches her throat as church ladies drift about her room
black garb sweating their hips filling cups with tap water drinking
drinking in glimpses of her steep undoing  The absence of a black
roomful of boy is measured again again  In the clutches of coffee
red-eyed Mamie knows their well-meaning murmur  One says She
a mama still  Once you have a chile you always a mama
