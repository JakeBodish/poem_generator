
When you asked if it rained bees or poison
you were asking the wrong question  Again 
 
You still didn’t understand the difference
between hurricanes and flooding  Thus between
 
gods and humans  Between your slum-
lordy digs and the shacks I pass that cling
 
to old boards and huddle around each family 
The yards marking the care of home 
 
Everywhere something is falling on
someone and I watch like an autumn
 
tourist tripping through the Berkshires 
I reach to catch a leaf  I try to straighten
 
a Pisa-like sapling  The wind wraps around
us both like a question mark and leaves
 
me standing the sole witness on this end 
I’m telling you about a place of silence 
 
You want it all to be a metaphor  I’m watching
a front porch crumble  Still someone sits there
