Ive already grown a goiter from this torture
hunched up here like a cat in Lombardy
or anywhere else where the stagnant waters poison 
My stomachs squashed under my chin my beards
pointing at heaven my brains crushed in a casket
my breast twists like a harpys  My brush
above me all the time dribbles paint
so my face makes a fine floor for droppings
My haunches are grinding into my guts
my poor ass strains to work as a counterweight
every gesture I make is blind and aimless 
My skin hangs loose below me my spines
all knotted from folding over itself 
Im bent taut as a Syrian bow 
Because Im stuck like this my thoughts
are crazy perfidious tripe
anyone shoots badly through a crooked blowpipe 
My painting is dead 
Defend it for me Giovanni protect my honor 
I am not in the right place I am not a painter
