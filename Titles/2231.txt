
I ask your doctor
of infectious disease if shes
read Williams   he cured
sick babies I tell her and
begin describing spring
and all   shes looking at the wall
now the floor   now your chart
now the door   never
heard of him she says
but I cant stop explaining
how important this is
I need to know your doctor
believes in the tenacity of nature
to endure   Im past his heart
attack   his strokes   and now as if
etching the tombstone myself   I find
I cant remember the date
he died or even
the year   of what now
are we the pure products   and what
does that even mean   pure   isnt it
obvious   we are each our own culture
alive with the virus thats waiting
to unmake us
