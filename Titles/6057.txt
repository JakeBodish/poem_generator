
Someone else’s child not you is running and running
down the beach  Both feet dig into the burning sand 
Two others heave one yellow bucket full of sugar-brown
 seaweed their twin suits flowering 
a conflation of pink over blue behind the water  So
landmark cactus and landmine rock battlefield uphill toward
the early moon’s white horse head and each wave collapses to your
right unsettles shouting every half minute have me shhhh
have me shhhh halve me shhhh
