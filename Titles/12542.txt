
Foild by our fellow-men depressd outwornWe leave the brutal world to take its wayAnd Patience in another life we sayThe world shall be thrust down and we up-borne  And will not then the immortal armies scornThe worlds poor routed leavings or will theyWho faild under the heat of this lifes daySupport the fervours of the heavenly mornNo no the energy of life may beKept on after the grave but not begunAnd he who flaggd not in the earthly strifeFrom strength to strength advancing only heHis soul well-knit and all his battles wonMounts and that hardly to eternal life
