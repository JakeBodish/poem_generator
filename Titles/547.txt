
After seven lean years
we are promised seven fat ones
if the cows do not die first 
Some care must be taken
to prevent their demise
in the scrub
or the slaughterhouse 
There must be enough bones
to throw and to bury 
 
The skull of a cow
I put it on 
There are many strewn in the field
there has not been much rain 
I look through the eyes
that is my eyes replace the eyes
that death has taken 
I can see out or through 
It is not a bad fate
to be a cow
to be at once
so awkward
so full of grace
so full of milk 
 
Everywhere the udders are full
the teats are ready
the mouth of the calf is soft and deep 
I would thrust my hand in it
for the wet joy of being so used 
 
My own breasts are marked
from the time the milk came in too fast
 
I did not have time to grow
to the moment of giving 
It is fitting
that beauty
leaves such scars 
 
Milk has passed through my fingers
has spurted through my fingers
but not once
during these seven lean years
