
Did you know there were hundreds of little
night moths
crowded against the window pane
to catch a glimmer of light
 
It was the scent of a strange perfume
from fallen cocoons sticky sincerity
that made them flee 
 
In this world of protected ruins
in this circular world
where people tell
and re-tell the same stories
in this world where people forgot
that the dyke
wouldnt be massive enough to hold back
the sea swell
in this world where each and every one
would flee in panic in the end
even the old lady sold
spun silver birds
while she whispered   
 
The tiny translucent and elegant
night moths
like freshly picked pumpkin seeds
crowded in the corner of that half-open window
clinging to the cold glass
light eager
while the vapor filled the room
reaching the nostrils
of colleagues
 
who didnt recognize each other
but intertwining their fingers
waited for someone elses words
to atone
and explain
and bestow
meaning to words
