
The hunter to the husbandmanPays tribute since our love beganAnd to love-loyalty dedicatesThe phantom kills he meditates Let me embrace embracing youBeauty of other shape and hueOdd glinting graces of which noneShone more than candle to your sunYour well-kissed hand was beckoning meIn unfamiliar imagery Smile your forgiveness each bright ghostDives in love’s glory and is lostYielding your comprehensive prideA homage even to suicide
