
Dear love for nothing less than thee Would I have broke this happy dream             It was a theme For reason much too strong for fantasy Therefore thou wakdst me wisely yet My dream thou brokst not but continuedst it  Thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice To make dreams truths and fables histories Enter these arms for since thou thoughtst it best Not to dream all my dream lets act the rest     As lightning or a tapers light Thine eyes and not thy noise wakd me             Yet I thought thee For thou lovest truth an angel at first sight But when I saw thou sawest my heart And knewst my thoughts beyond an angels art When thou knewst what I dreamt when thou knewst when Excess of joy would wake me and camst then I must confess it could not choose but be Profane to think thee any thing but thee     Coming and staying showd thee thee But rising makes me doubt that now             Thou art not thou  That love is weak where fears as strong as he Tis not all spirit pure and brave If mixture it of fear shame honour have Perchance as torches which must ready be Men light and put out so thou dealst with me Thou camst to kindle goest to come then I Will dream that hope again but else would die
