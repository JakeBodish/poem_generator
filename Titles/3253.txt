
If you believe in snow you have to believe
in water as its meant to be loosed
from clouds arranged like asphodel  Because thats
what its like to come back a slow
surfacing memory spiraling away  You can sleep
so long whole seasons are forgotten
like a hospital-room plaster spidered
with cracks in Portugal shapes  You can love
sleep like water love your heavy limbs
pushing river and ocean aside 
After Maggie woke the doctors had her stringing
bracelets of semiprecious beads and she
couldnt stop counting the kinds of blue 
Here summer in the high shade of a ginko
she pulls up a handful of stones on silk
and we drink grapefruit seltzer listening
to the tinny chime of bubbles
rising to the air  She cant remember
autumn so we tell her someday this tree will drop
its fan-shaped leaves all at once
golden in the October crush
of every plants frantic strip show  Later
well see mountains through the scrim of empty
branches and if we can look straight up
into the atmosphere see the same plain old sky
revolving  When we ask Maggie what color it is
she always says iolite picturing beads
like raindrops shining azure on the table 
She forgets that sometimes things dont stay
where you leave them that the sky fades
to white even before snow begins
to fall  Its hard but we have to tell her
even sapphires dont glow blue
without some kind of help
