
I feel my failure intensely
as if it were a vital organ
the gods grew from the side of my head 
You cant cover it with a hat and I no longer
can sleep on that side its so tender 
I wasnt quite faithful enough
to carry this sort of weight up the mountain 
When I took my vows at nineteen
I had no idea that gods were so merciless 
Fear makes for good servants
and bravery is fraudulent  When I awoke
I wasnt awake enough
