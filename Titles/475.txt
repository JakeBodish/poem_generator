
 I want to draw the sky 
 Draw it my darling 
 I have 
 And why do you spread
the colors this way
 Because the sky
has no edges 
     
 I want to draw the earth 
 Draw it my darling 
 I have 
 And who is this
 She is my friend 
 And where is the earth
 In her handbag 
     
 I want to draw the moon 
 Draw it my darling 
 I cant 
 Why
 The waves shatter it
continuously 
     
 I want to draw paradise 
 Draw it my darling 
 I have 
 But I dont see any colors 
 It is colorless 
     
 I want to draw the war 
 Draw it my darling 
 I have 
 And what is this circle
 Guess 
 A drop of blood
 No 
 A bullet
 No 
 Then what
 The button
that turns off the lights
