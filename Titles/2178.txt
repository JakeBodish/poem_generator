Afternoon burns everything off Franklin Street 
               Even the birds even the flies 
Or iced-tea sugar and chicken grease weigh everyone
               into a doze all indoors in a cool
they said would never come eighty years ago
               when this was still the center of business
and the civilized left these high hours to the dogs
               ice in a highball and let each house
close its lids a while  Theyve kept their quiet
               so Im alone before the windows
the radiant panes each with its scrim of clay
               the finish the river gives everything
so nothing not even glass is clear 
               Its almost painful this saturation
this street and its stores of rugs and signs and flags
               bright and strange as a magazine photo
youd find in an attic or an antique store
               hard to believe the color was ever real 
The teacups the painted china and jeweled eggs
               even the bottles medicine vials
and flasks each with its ounce of dirt
               even the smell of the prolific earth
the sedimentary atmosphere of empire chairs
               and oak armoires and mantles that survive
their tall white homes like the plantation house
               where later Ill witness again
the marriage of gray suit and hoop skirt
               that still feels like a dream where Ill walk
out of or is it into myself
               the maitreds small solicitous voice
proffering another julep cotton-leaf hand
               silver cup though even he must be
a reenactment or a revenant
               a hanger for the clothes of memory 
I will take it I would a handful of refuge
               in unthinking weather will take
the same lethargic joy in a breeze any chill
               in the throat any kind of shade 
so I enter the dim of one old cotton house
               its air-conditioned maze of hand-tools
and quilts corn cribs and cotton gins and of course
               the owners smile porcelain bright almost
blinding blooming in welcome and how-you-do
               and what-brings-you  We talk amid rows
of cook-stoves stew-pots and cast-iron skillets
               about the wedding Ive come to see
on the famed estate the time the town exploded
               the Rhythm Clubs inferno and then
she ventures she knows the accent knows
               Im from Alabama and soon shes eloquent
on our lakes and rivers where the mister takes her
               every chance they get  Shes seen it all
so she asks where Im from and when I say
               she starts to glow gushing over mountains
all the way to Gatlinburg  Shes walked each one
               even skied the states one slope which conjures
not the Southern snow that required almost everything
               around us but snow cold snow a thought
that cools me further so my sweat is nearly dry
               when the smile tightens across her teeth
and she leans in to say I just love it               you know there are no darkies there 
Then afternoon is a conspiracy of color
               an echo the heat or the history
in our voices draws us into 
               someone elses version of ourselves 
and the inevitable painful quiet
               in which an answer must arrive 
What can you say And how long do you have to wait
               before you can leave before you can walk
out of yourself and down the cotton-trading streets
               into the smother of trees
on some more recent lane How long do you have to wait
               before you can leave and not be followed
and how long do you have to walk before the mockingbirds
               drown in bass and drum and anger
before you can cross back into the proper century
               The smell of the river stays with you
maybe even grows as you move so you dont know
               where youre going and the key in your hand
could open a car door or a plantation room
               or nothing at all some door thats vanished
in the air Junes shimmer from the asphalt
               and the roofs of every house so you walk
toward that moment when the sun starts burning
               and the magnolias thick perfume washes
all around and you find yourself on a corner
               all linen and sweat again the only one
whod walk in a heat like this  You have no idea
               where you are so you cock your head
as if you might hear your way through the afternoon
               and when you raise your head you see
across the street two men hunched in shadow
               on a barbershops stoop ties
dangling like smoke in the solid air  Theyve seen you
               and now their brows sharpen
as if they know too youre not from here
               and in the space between you anything
could pass the ghosts of Farragut or Grant
               or a hot white Caddy rattling New Orleans Bounce
youre waiting to see it seems like years or centuries
               then one rises ties his tie and steps back in
leaving the other who keeps your eye
               a moment longer then looks into the distance
through that lace of smoke that seems etched in the air
               for something far behind you something
you dont even know how to look for
               something that may never arrive
