
Another year another deadly blowAnother mighty Empire overthrownAnd We are left or shall be left aloneThe last that dare to struggle with the Foe Tis well from this day forward we shall knowThat in ourselves our safety must be soughtThat by our own right hands it must be wroughtThat we must stand unpropped or be laid low O dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheerWe shall exult if they who rule the landBe men who hold its many blessings dearWise upright valiant not a servile bandWho are to judge of danger which they fearAnd honour which they do not understand
