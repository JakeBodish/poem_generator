
Of course wars of course lice of course limbs on opposing sides
to remind a body about ambivalence of course orphans and empty beds and eyes
exiled for blinking in the harsh light  Of course Khrushchev gave Crimea
to the Ukraine in a blind drunk and yes land mines and burning skin
and of course organs some members dismembered
to shake at strangers and their evil and there is no way
to imagine that a man shaking a dried penis would ever utter the word darling 
Of course personal add starch for pain add bluing of course hang
the laundry in the basement there are thieves in the backyard of course
departing trains carload after carload of sorrow
the man on top of a boxcar waving
his rifle silhouetted against the white sky its color draining
the way warmth left the Bosnian after he’d burned the last page of the last book
knowing he had reached the end of something though it was not end enough 
Of course kisses the stages of kissing like running borders
endless conversations stations of the cross till even the promise of kissing bores you
of course teeth gnashing ethnic cleansing  The cynical will shrug off the past
the future the whole left hip of Ecuador slashed for six days of oil
of course an X on the coats of the sick so they would stand apart
for deportation of course rogue tumors over the body politic
the same bodies that took Egyptian mummies and powdered them
to use as food seasoning bon vivant cannibalism
and yes civilized men tossed living penguins into furnaces to fuel their ships 
Of course partitions so that after the new territories were defined
families had to line up on a cliff with bullhorns
to talk to their people on the other side
of course courage at times a weapon against yearning surrender another
a mother of course goes on setting the table even if it’s with broken plates
and a friend will say gently of course I want to ride with you to the funeral
of course of course of course of course
now then negotiations whatever
palisades the end of whimsy
but then one evening though it is wartime
a man climbs the hill to an amphitheater to play his cello at twilight
and history stops talking for a moment and sighs
while the melancholy of Albinoni
passes from heart to heart and each lifts a little
the way passing a baby around a room can be sacramental
and the memories of simple pleasures become more beautiful the memory
of your joy on a highway to see in the next lane in a neighboring car
a clown take off his nose at the end of the day the memory
of how your mother laid roses sweetheart roses on the cold grate of the fireplace
and the sudden rain one afternoon in fall after you’d hiked far into the dells
and you huddled deep in your overcoat in the wet
waiting out the storm with a sheep
that had come up to lean against your side
like a rock
