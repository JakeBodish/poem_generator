
I only have a moment so let me tell you the shortest storyabout arriving at a long loved place the house of friends in Mainetheir lawn of wildflowers their grandfather clock and candidportraits their gabled attic rooms and woodstove in the kitchenall accessories of the genuine summer years before when I wastheir son’s girlfriend and tied an apron behind my neck beneathmy braids and took from their garden the harvest for a dinnerI would make alone and serve at their big table with the gladnessof the found and loved  The eggplant shone like polished woodthe tomatoes smelled like their furred collars the dozen zucchinilined up on the counter like placid troops with the onions theirminions and I even remember the garlic each clove from its airmail envelope brought to the cutting board ready for my instruction And in this very slight story a decade later I came by myselfhaving been dropped by the airport cab and waited for the familyto arrive home from work  I walked into the lawn waist-highin the swaying purple lupines the subject of   June’s afternoon lightas I had never been addressed   a displaced young woman withcropped hair no place to which I wished to return and no oneto gather me in his arms  That day the lupines received meand I was in love with them because they were all I had leftand in that same manner I have loved much of the world since thenand who is to say there is more of a reason or more to love
