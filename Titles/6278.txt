Bored in the balcony reading your novel
hoping it will keep me awake   
religion was always a blind spot   
with my Sunday headache waiting for the service
to finish so I can retrieve my little chorister
no god in us but song while
pale important teenage Sophia
in blue head chorister ribbon
face dumpy as a Flemish burgomaster
bosses littler kids and loves
leading them expressionless
in paired rows from the choir stalls
holding the processional cross high
shushing and huffily eyeing them
for babyish disregard of cleanly neatness
my own chorister dripping orts of tissues
she stows in her sleeves for sniffles
in the choir room struggles
out of her ruff ringed dark brown inside
from years of child chorister sweat hair oil dead skin 
Me Your other ruff was white and clean
Her Sophia said it was too big 
She gave me this one instead  I showed her
it was dirty and tight  She said “deal with it ”
