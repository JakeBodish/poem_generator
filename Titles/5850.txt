To Tom S  of Missouri possum friend clerk at Lloyd’s Now I remember that you rang a silent bellBy the foot of the bridge at the River “Thames ”With dull roots and dried tubers you wrote poems and lamentsAnd grew more English month on month bowing to kings and princes Americans came drifting in from the sea and from the west borderAnd with them and with me especiallyEverything was pig-headedAnd I made hay from poppycock and painted adjectivesJust so we could start a new fellowshipAnd we all escaped our personalities without expressing them And then I was sent off to Rapallo                trailed by childrenAnd you to your desk at Faber-FaberTill we had nothing but China and silence in common And then when modernism had come to its worstWe wrote and published in Po-EtryThrough all the one hundred kinds of shy and whispering silenceInto a poem of a thousand blank pagesThat was the first heaveAnd into ten thousand poems full of Chinese reticence And with chafing saddle and the bit in his mouthOut from the East came Confucius and his philosophyAnd there came also the “True-man” Ben-it-o to awe mePlaying in the death-mask of Jefferson In the botched houses of Europe they gave us more foetid musicClanging instruments like the sound of a myriad dying My forefather Confucius got me drunk and I danced                because my savage mind wouldn’t keep stillWithout his music playingAnd I wrapped in silence woke up with my head on his lapAnd my voice returning to me from every radioAnd before the end of the broadcast we scattered like cards or bombsI had to be off to China so far across my desktopYou back to your London-bridge And our Roosevelt who was brave as a rodentWas president in Washing Town and let in the usurious rabble And one May he sent the soldiers for me                despite the long distance And what with broken idols and so on I won’t say it wasn’t hard goingOver roads twisted like my brain’s folds And I was still going late in the war                with defeat blowing in from the NorthNot guessing how little I knew of the cost                and how soon I would be paying it And what a receptionSteel cages two books set on a packing-crate tableAnd I was caught and had no hope of escaping And you would walk out with me to the northeast corner of my cellToward the Alpine peak with clouds about it as foul as London airWith you whispering and with a bang not a whimperWith glasses like dinner plates glowing grass-green in the darknessPleasure-fasting with women coming and going without speechWith the dandruff-flakes falling like snowAnd the hyacinth girls eating lunch in silenceAnd the sea knee-deep reflecting white eyebrows  Eyebrows turned white are an awful sight in the sunlightHideously aged  And the sea-girls singing back at usDrowning in seaweed brocadeAnd the wind twisting the song and desiccating itCovering our eyes with dust                 And this is the way the world ends                 With a bang not with a whimper I went up to the court for prosecutionTried standing mute offered a madman’s songAnd got no conviction               and went back to Saint Elizabeths                Committed And once again later you stood at the foot of my bedAnd then the visit ended you went back to BloomsburyAnd if you ask if I recall that partingIt is like the hair falling from my hieratic head                Confused     Whirl Centripetal MateWhat is the use of talking until I end my songI end my song in the dark I call in the nurseHold the pill in my hand                As she says “Take this”And swallow it down silent
