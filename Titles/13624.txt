
He sits at the table cloudlight of March
One tone with his hair gray-silver on silver 
Midday fare in Vermont is basic enough 
In West Newbury eggs and toast will do 
Though our doctor’s had his sips of wine as well 
“Just don’t be fooled  They’re not as nice as you
Think they are  Live here a few more winters
You’ll get to know them clearer and vice-versa ”
Three years now and we’re still finding our way
Newcomers need a guide to show them the ropes
And he has been explaining township and county
Almost from the sunstruck day we met him
That very first July in this old house 
“I’ll cite an instance of community
Spirit at work North Country justice 
A case I just happened to be involved in 
No please all right if you are having one ”
He holds his glass aloft and then lets fall
A silence that has grown familiar to us
From other stories told on other days
The will to recount building its head of steam 
“Well now you have to know about the victim 
His name was Charlie Deudon no doubt Canuck
Stock some generations back but he
Nor no one else could tell you if they cared 
Deudons had been dirt farmers here as long
As anybody knew  They never starved
But never had a dime to spare either 
Charlie resolved to change the Deudon luck 
And that’s just what he did  Or almost did       
He’d graduated two classes ahead of mine
We knew each other naturally but not
On terms of friendship  Fact is he had no friends
And only one girlfriend whom he married
Day after Commencement June of ‘32 
And then he set to work and never stopped
Again until they made him stop for good ”
A wisp of a smile half irony half
Bereavement plays about his guileless face 
Red cheeks blue eyes a beardless Santa Claus
Whose bag contains apart from instruments
Of healing stories parables and proverbs
Painkillers too for when all else fails 
“What kind of work had all that hard work been”
“Oh farming like his elders only better 
All the modern improvements fancy feed
And fertilizers plus machinery 
He was the first in these parts to milk
His herd in any way but as ‘twas done
Since Adam’s boys first broke ground with a plow 
And anything machines couldn’t handle
Charlie did himself from dawn to midnight 
He never wasted a word or spilled a drop
Of milk or drank a drop of beer or liquor 
He was unnatural  And he made that farm
Into a showplace a kind of 4-H model 
He made good money yes but not a dollar
Would he spend unnecessarily 
Do you get the picture They hated him
The boys that hung around the package store 
The most they ever got from tightfist Charlie
Deudon was a nod out from under his cap 
His trademark a baseball cap striped white and red 
They envied him for getting his hay in first
And there was more  A boy that he had hired
By the name of Carroll Giddens was their buddy 
Likeable fellow regulation issue
The sort that knocks back a pint or a fifth
In half a shake and tells off-color stories
Till he’s got them choked to death with laughing 
‘Course the wisecracks they loved best were those
About poor Charlie and his gold-plated farm       
Just one more case of what’s been often said
By commentators on democracy 
How it helps everyone keep modest ”
Teasing mischief has crept into his voice 
A self-taught anthropologist as well
As teller of tales he has other frames
Of reference to place around events
Local or international  He knows
That things can stand for more than what they are
Indeed says standing for things is why we’re here
And quotes chapter and verse to prove his point 
“Think of the worldwide scapegoat ritual 
In halfway civilized societies
An animal’s the one relieved from life
Duty am I right A fellow tribesman
Will do in a pinch if animals are lacking
Or if communal fears get screwed too tight       
Anyhow it was clear that something more
Than common envy stirred up the lynch law 
Their own failure’s what they wanted dead ”
Seconds pass in silence as he stares
At something perhaps a knothole in the pine
Floorboard  He looks up eyebrows raised
And twirls the glass stem between stubby fingers 
A coil of rope hung on the wall we see
Has made him pause and heave experienced sighs 
“Here  Have another  So was Charlie punished”
“I’m going to tell you better me than others 
You see I was involved no no no
Not in the deed Lord no just as a witness 
It happened this way hope you’re not squeamish 
Charlie had this boy to help with chores
The one named Carroll  Married two kids I think 
Not too reliable  But so few are
Nor could you call his wages generous 
His buddies must have stood him drinks is all
I can say  He’d a skinful half the time 
Was certainly drunk that Christmas Eve morning 
No reason to doubt what Charlie told his wife 
Charlie’d been up to help at six with the milking
And Carroll drunk as a fiddler’s bitch was there
Loading a pair of milk cans into the barrow 
He took a slip and the whole business spilled 
Wooden handle clipped him in the side
And he fell too right in the puddle of milk 
And started laughing  Charlie you can guess
Didn’t join in he told him to get on home 
‘What about the milk’ ‘Go home’ he said
‘You’re drunk ’ ‘But what about the milk’ asks Carroll 
‘Comes out of next week’s paycheck’ Charlie says 
And then the trouble starts with Carroll swearing
And yelping till Charlie gives him a little tap
And goes indoors  By then Carroll could tell
The barrow handle had cracked a rib or two 
He drove into town to see his doctor that
Wasn’t me and word went out that Charlie
Had roughed up his innocent assistant 
That’s all they needed Carroll’s friends  About
Time that stuck-up bastard got his due
He’s gone too far this time but we’ll show him
