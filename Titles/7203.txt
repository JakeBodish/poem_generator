
You better not fool with a Bumblebee Ef you dont think they can sting youll seeTheyre lazy to look at an kind o goBuzzin an bummin aroun so slowAn ac so slouchy an all fagged outDanglin their legs as they drone aboutThe hollyhawks at they cant climb inIthout ist a-tumble-un out aginWunst I watched one climb clean wayIn a jimson-blossom I did one day An I ist grabbed it   an nen let go An Ooh-ooh Honey I told ye soSays The Raggedy Man an he ist runAn pullt out the stinger an dont laugh noneAn says They has ben folks I guessAt thought I wuz predjudust more er less Yit I still muntain at a BumblebeeWears out his welcome too quick fer me
