Early morning over Rouen hopeful high courageous morningAnd the laughter of adventure and the steepness of the stairAnd the dawn across the river and the wind across the bridgesAnd the empty littered station and the tired people there Can you recall those mornings and the hurry of awakeningAnd the long-forgotten wonder if we should miss the wayAnd the unfamiliar faces and the coming of provisionsAnd the freshness and the glory of the labour of the day Hot noontide over Rouen and the sun upon the citySun and dust unceasing and the glare of cloudless skiesAnd the voices of the Indians and the endless stream of soldiersAnd the clicking of the tatties and the buzzing of the flies Can you recall those noontides and the reek of steam and coffeeHeavy-laden noontides with the evening’s peace to winAnd the little piles of Woodbines and the sticky soda bottlesAnd the crushes in the “Parlour” and the letters coming inQuiet night-time over Rouen and the station full of soldiersAll the youth and pride of England from the ends of all the earthAnd the rifles piled together and the creaking of the sword-beltsAnd the faces bent above them and the gay heart-breaking mirth Can I forget the passage from the cool white-bedded Aid PostPast the long sun-blistered coaches of the khaki Red Cross trainTo the truck train full of wounded and the weariness and laughterAnd “Good-bye and thank you Sister” and the empty yards againCan you recall the parcels that we made them for the railroadCrammed and bulging parcels held together by their stringAnd the voices of the sargeants who called the Drafts togetherAnd the agony and splendour when they stood to save the KingCan you forget their passing the cheering and the wavingThe little group of people at the doorway of the shedThe sudden awful silence when the last train swung to darknessAnd the lonely desolation and the mocking stars o’erheadCan you recall the midnights and the footsteps of night watchersMen who came from darkness and went back to dark againAnd the shadows on the rail-lines and the all inglorious labourAnd the promise of the daylight firing blue the window- paneCan you recall the passing through the kitchen door to morningMorning very still and solemn breaking slowly on the townAnd the early coastways engines that had met the ships at daybreakAnd the Drafts just out from England and the day shift coming downCan you forget returning slowly stumbling on the cobblesAnd the white-decked Red Cross barges dropping seawards for the tideAnd the search for English papers and the blessed cool of waterAnd the peace of half-closed shutters that shut out the world outsideCan I forget the evenings and the sunsets on the islandAnd the tall black ships at anchor far below our balconyAnd the distant call of bugles and the white wine in the glassesAnd the long line of the street lamps stretching Eastwards to the seaWhen the world slips slow to darkness when the office fire burns lowerMy heart goes out to Rouen Rouen all the world awayWhen other men remember I remember our AdventureAnd the trains that go from Rouen at the ending of the day
