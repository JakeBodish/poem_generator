For an hour I forgot my fat self my neurotic innards my addiction to alignment For an hour I forgot my fear of rain For an hour I was a salamandershimmying through the kelp in search of shoreand under his fingers the notes slid loosefrom my belly in a long jellyrope of eggsthat took root in the mud  And whatwould hatch I did not know a lie  A waltz  An apostle of glass For an hour I stood on two legs and ran  For an hour I panted and galloped For an hour I was a maple treeand under the summer of his fingers the notes seeded and winged away
