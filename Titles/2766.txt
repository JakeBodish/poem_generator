
There is
no
audience
because
there is
no audience 
So if you speak only to
imagined beings
what does only mean
--------------------------
This building formerly a restaurant      
this small room has been scraped of its paint 
and denuded of most former furniture but 
also it has grown in size can a building be 
enticed to grow Because it is now as big as an 
airplane hangar 
--------------------------
Your
          beautiful face 
unbloodied beneath
          flies
Mother of flies your
          beauty 
to turn to  If only 
the audience
could see how
you are peaceful and the
          flies 
languid glossy
But the audience will still bring
          its own feelings 
to these 
words
not seeing you
               not seeing 
what I 
am present for 
--------------------------
Who has left me 
here I have 
Who are your 
familiars
                   Come 
            into the 
enlarging 
page if you dare
--------------------------
     Because he invented 
your shape I do mean 
structure
because he invented you badly 
           everything is still hidden 
--------------------------
I was to impale myself on a
quadrangular
steel rod with a blunt end
                     with a blunt end 
which would make puncture
      more difficult 
and I tried its too hard  I cant 
Okay said the voice  I cant 
Okay
then I was weeping
                              But its blood Im 
crying blood I 
screamed
Thats part of it
said the voice 
---------------------------
I think this is hard 
Thats part of it
How they prefer him must go 
I think this is difficult singing
Length and repetition 
         create power
If this voice can return like 
         a body
It resembles something thats already been 
Changing 
------------------------------
Chestnuts broken
autumnal fungi
so you will remember that
          its fall 
outside
         falling  youll go down
this is no story for the puling
          social classes 
No not at all 
its for us my familiars say 
who let me weep blood on their ground
