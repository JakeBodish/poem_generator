
Last night this commercial came on TV  It was this white lady making a nice dinner for her husband  She made him some baked chicken with potatoes and gravy and some kind of greens not collards but they still looked real good  Everything looked so delicious I just wanted to reach into that television and snatch a plate for myself 
He gave her a kiss and then a voice came on saying Hell love you for it and then the commercial went off 
I sat on Miss Ednas scratchy couch wondering if that man and woman really ate that food or just threw it all away 
Now Ms  Marcus wants to know why I wrote that the lady is white and I say because its true  And Ms  Marcus says Lonnie what does race have to do with it forgetting that she asked us to use lots of details when we wrote  Forgetting that whole long talk she gave yesterday about the importance of description I dont say anything back to her just look down at my arm  Its dark brown and theres a scab by my wrist that I dont pick at if I remember not to  I look at my knuckles  Theyre real dark too 
Outside its starting to rain and the way the rain comes down tap tapping against the window gets me to thinking  Ms  Marcus dont understand some things even though shes my favorite teacher in the world  Things like my brown brown arm  And the white lady and man with all that good food to throw away  How if you turn on your TV thats what you see people with lots and lots of stuff not having to sit on scratchy couches in Miss Ednas house  And the true fact is alotta those people are white  Maybe its that if youre white you cant see all the whiteness around you
