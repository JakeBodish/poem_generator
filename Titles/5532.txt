
Promising myself  I would not do this againIs what kept me goingA friend told me toAnd I listenedTaking a thing to the end of its lifeIs what I was made to doI think I am not attunedTo the things that breatheWell that’s not trueI am in tune to breath and lifeAnd little falls of  flowersWhen the moon was highI went out to the streamAnd brought in the waterFor my folks my kin my brethrenI brought in the greenish milkTo feed the ones who were already dyingOh did they goOh I do not know
