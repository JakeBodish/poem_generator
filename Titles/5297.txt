
That the dead are real to usCannot be denied That the living are more realWhen they are deadTerrifies that the dead can riseAs the living do is possibleIs possible to surmise But all the stars cannot come nearAll we meet in an eye Flee from me fear as sootFlies in a breeze do not burn Or settle in my sight I’ve tasted you long enoughLet me savorSomething otherwise Who wakes beside me nowSuits my soul so I turn to wordsOnly to say he changesInto his robe rustles a pageHe raises the lid of the pianoTo release what’s born in its cage If   words come back To say they compromise Or swear again they have diedThere’s no news in that I replyBut a music without notesThese notes comprise stillAs spring beneath us lies Already something otherwise
