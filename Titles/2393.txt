Time hath my lord a wallet at his backWherein he puts alms for oblivionA great-sized monster of ingratitudesThose scraps are good deeds past which are devourdAs fast as they are made forgot as soon As done perseverance dear my lordKeeps honour bright to have done is to hangQuite out of fashion like a rusty mailIn monumental mockery  Take the instant wayFor honour travels in a strait so narrowWhere one but goes abreast keep then the pathFor emulation hath a thousand sonsThat one by one pursue if you give wayOr hedge aside from the direct forthrightLike to an enterd tide they all rush byAnd leave you hindmostOr like a gallant horse falln in first rankLie there for pavement to the abject rearOer-run and trampled on then what they do in presentThough less than yours in past must oertop yours For time is like a fashionable hostThat slightly shakes his parting guest by the handAnd with his arms outstretchd as he would flyGrasps in the comer welcome ever smilesAnd farewell goes out sighing  O let not virtue seekRemuneration for the thing it wasFor beauty witHigh birth vigour of bone desert in serviceLove friendship charity are subjects all To envious and calumniating time One touch of nature makes the whole world kinThat all with one consent praise new-born gawdsThough they are made and moulded of things pastAnd give to dust that is a little gilt More laud than gilt oer-dusted The present eye praises the present object Then marvel not thou great and complete manThat all the Greeks begin to worship AjaxSince things in motion sooner catch the eye Than what not stirs  The cry went once on theeAnd still it might and yet it may againIf thou wouldst not entomb thyself aliveAnd case thy reputation in thy tentWhose glorious deeds but in these fields of late Made emulous missions mongst the gods themselvesAnd drave great Mars to faction
