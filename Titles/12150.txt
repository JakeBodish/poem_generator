
I the Lord will make barrenyour fields and your fairways Your refrigerators will be emptyno steaks and no leg bonesno butter and no cornbread And I will remove your screen doors force the mosquitoes indoorswhere you lie on the bed undead For my house you have not readiedno flat screen and no broadband My habitation is a wastelandof furniture from motel rooms I will send the ostrich and badgerin herds through your wrecked rooms your beds will be entered by turnstilethe floor will seethe with bees For my house is but a prefab its roof lets in my rain Woe is the Lord of Heavenwho has no mansion on earth Cries are heard from my fish trapscrows flap on my hat rackpandemonium at the thresholdas the owls and bats flit in Silence reigns in the last placeand the first place has no sway For my knife-edge is impatientmy ledge crumbles like cake I have warned you to beware You await a handsome saviorbut the plain man draws near   Zephaniah
