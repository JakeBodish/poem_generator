
Calling to mind since first my love begunTh incertain times oft varying in their courseHow things still unexpectedly have runAs t please the fates by their resistless forceLastly mine eyes amazedly have seenEssex great fall Tyrone his peace to gainThe quiet end of that long-living QueenThis Kings fair entrance and our peace with SpainWe and the Dutch at length ourselves to severThus the world doth and evermore shall reel Yet to my goddess am I constant everHoweer blind fortune turn her giddy wheelThough heaven and earth prove both to me untrueYet am I still inviolate to you
