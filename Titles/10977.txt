
Now as I watch you strong of arm and endurance battling and strugglingWith the waves that rush against you ever with invincible strength returningInto my heart grown each day more tranquil and peaceful comes a fierce longingOf mind and soul that will not be appeased until like you I breast yon deep and boundless expanse of blue With an outward stroke of power intense your mighty arm goes forthCleaving its way through waters that rise and roll ever a ceaseless vigil keepingOver the treasures beneath My heart goes out to you of dauntless courage and spirit indomitableAnd though my lips would speak my spirit forbids me to ask“Is your heart as true as your arm”
