
I cut myself upon the thought of youAnd yet I come back to it again and againA kind of fury makes me want to draw you outFrom the dimness of the presentAnd set you sharply above me in a wheel of roses Then going obviously to inhale their fragranceI touch the blade of you and cling upon itAnd only when the blood runs out across my fingersAm I at all satisfied
