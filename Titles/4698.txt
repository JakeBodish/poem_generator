la herradura s v  ¿Do I have a mother Have her pinkie in my hand crossing the street Have her breath on my hair as she sings arru-rru mi niño to sleep  ¿Don’t you mean where ¿What was your question I’m older  Think more about memory  It makes me crazy  Obsessed  Her warm breasts on my belly as she knelt to tell me todo va estar bien  I’ll never see her again was the fear as if she’s gone died will never come back  I whispered it hidden in banana groves looking at the sky hoping one of those planes would take me to wherever she had left to  Whenever Mom hung the clothes to dry not a cloud in the sky  I could see her sandals picking up dust  For a second  For a second I believe she’s back  It went like that every day  Every single night   I’ll never see her again  But then I did  Her face  Her hair  She was the same  So much had changed  I do not remember  what it was I truly felt
