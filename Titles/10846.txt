
There’s a dispute as to whether a name can be given to mills or not  If
an essential root is given to one arm they might be revolvers in insect’s
casings winding down a river of dirt in giving you America too small
a thimble the carcass of instruction and wavy diminutive hand signals 
From a cracked stone mouthing to an unplayed game still wrapped
to the skin of my plastic voice  There is a slow moving not fast like
the static form of urban frames  If you want and here is IF again
with indecision to describe misdirected outcroppings from a battery
of daylight shells I mean light I mean dark colored turtles one map
giving birth to another this flown heavy with rupture and landed after
a piece was found  Not enough  There is a simple solution to your
house and my wooden block  One politic NOT on top of an Other as
one’s head is wrapped in a box in a hole  Spittle looms swim bide time
clicks made queues on an S connected to separate one from a ONE
towels in seeing an ocean first and making Balboan curves you know
there are all kinds of sticks  A brick painted with soft hair builds up
questions to age and blacken linings whip tailed lizards their eyes are
what implants carbonized blinking placed alongside letters the hold
on becoming an END  Chips give sound to fingers the Oh returning
in flowing error twice committed  Flood  Not a zero or a one as if
cornered with prostituted faces leaning outward an Escape weighing
about an army of lip collectors and fused hands and their whispers of
Xs as in 2 again or more  There is the border of skin there is the
border of membrane there is the border of number  Tongues firing the
burned and buried  2 and on and THEN its disappearance  Invisibility
solidified a welt on a willow  You know a letter a cache in a person 
Memory management errors undone  Fluid as blood  Blood as a
turning through time
