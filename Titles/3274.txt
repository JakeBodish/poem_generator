
I
One day as she rinsed her wash from the jetty
the bays cold grave rose up through her arms
and into her life 
Her tears froze into spectacles 
The island raised itself by its grass
and the herring-flag waved in the deep 
II
And the swarm of small pox caught up with him
settled down onto his face 
He lies and stares at the ceiling 
How it had rowed up through the silence 
The nows eternally flowing stain
the nows eternally bleeding end-point
