
The church knelt heavyabove us as we attended Sunday School circled by age group and hunkeredon little wood folding chairswhere we gave our nickels saidour verses heard the stories sangthe solid swinging songs It could have been God abovein the pews His restless love siftingwith dust from the joists  We littleseeds swelled in the stone cellar bursting to grow toward the light Maybe it was that I liked how upstairs outside an avid sun stormed down burning the sharp- edged shadows back to their buildings orhow the winter air knifedafter the dreamy basement Maybe the day we learned whatever would have kept me believingI was just watching lightpoke from the high small windowand tilt to the floor where I could make it a gold strap on my shoe wrapmy ankle embrace any part of me
