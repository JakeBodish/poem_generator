Baking two parts flour to one part water could stop a bullet  So good soldiers carried their hardtack over their hearts  Break it down with a rifle butt flood it fry it in pig fat to make hellfire stew Gnaw it raw and praise the juice Does wheat prepare for this as it growsseeking the light in a half-thawed fieldDo stalks know their strength is merely in their number What is ground downwe name flour in promise that it will be made useful  Otherwise it’s just dust  Sheet iron crackers  Teeth-dullers Would you call it starving if a man dieswith hardtack still tucked in his pocketCan you call it food if the bullet comes onlyat the moment he gives in and swallows
