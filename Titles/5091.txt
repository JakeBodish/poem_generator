
I had just hung up from talking to youand we had been so immersed in the difficultyyou were facing and forgive meI was thinking that as long as we kept talkingyou in your car in the parking lot of the boys’ schoolas the afternoon deepened into early eveningand me in the study all the books aroundthat had been sources of beauty to usas long as we stayed in the conversationpadded with history like the floor of the pine forest as long as I thought out loud made a jokeat my own expense you would be harbored in that exchange but the boys were leaving the trackand after we hung up I looked out the window to see the top of the bare January trees spotlit to silvery red massive but made from the thinnesttwigs at the ends of the branches at the ends of the limbsthey were waving and shining in a lightlike no other and left only to them
