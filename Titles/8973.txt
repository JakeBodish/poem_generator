When handling the past in the present tense chronology is of the   
utmost importance  Suppose I say I’m eight years old and all the rooms   
of my father’s house are larger than life  Then I say Two days after my   
first divorce the only landscape I know is simplified bone-smooth  The   
past remains practically undisturbed  But suppose I reverse the order   
in which the episodes are recreated and time goes on a rampage and
I find myself coming and going  Journeys on land have a spherical
tendency because this is always at some level the nature of the ter-
rain  The anthill crumbles in the rain and the ants returning with
more provisions walk past the leveled mound having noticed noth-
ing they keep looking for home  Though each mouth carries its
crumb of substance tradition and evolution will see to it that it isn’t
eaten until the journey has been completed  It’s not unusual for the
ants to walk repeatedly over the ruins  A squirrel chases itself so fast
around the trunk of a palm tree that it appears to be standing still
like propeller blades in midflight  I used to know the cause of this
illusion  I say Someone’s at the door somebody please get the door
although I haven’t lived there in years  Somebody please get the door 
I want nothing more than my share of the past

True  There are degrees of isolation  Sixteen days after a shopping
center collapses like a punctured lung in Seoul South Korea a nine-
teen-year-old girl is found alive in an elevator shaft  Her only nour-
ishment throughout the ordeal is an apple that a monk gives her in
a dream  The doctors are skeptical and attribute her survival instead
to “her false perception of time ” The brain with its network of
rivers and tributaries the flow rigorously controlled is taxed by a
sudden drought  Or an apple passes from one hand to another  In
both versions extraordinary measures achieve a modicum of nor-
malcy shaken again when a boy age thirteen his circadian rhythms
still fighting the syncopation of jet lag walks out the window on
the thirtieth floor of a Swedish building  They’re calling it “a sleep-
walking accident” as if sleep were a cognitive state  If that were the
case our sheep and our prayers would keep us up all night count-
ing and repenting and there would be degrees of salvation  I can tell
you that none of this is true but much of it is and you will not for-
give me when you discover that I’ve led you to believe otherwise 
The truth in one form or another has ways of finding you  Blame
it on your false perception of the facts  Time the sniper has lapses in
which its eyes tire and its focus falters and it aims at itself  So the
window opens the girl shakes the rubble from her dress a monk
gathering apples in his robe almost catches the falling boy

They say that when the Who performed at Leeds University on
Valentine’s Day 1970 Pete Townshend played against his own echo
during some of those riveting excursions he launched into through-
out the band’s quarter-hour-long offering of My Generation  I lis-
ten to it differently now  I wait for the echo they tell me is there
preceding each note and it’s as if I were experiencing the music a pri-
ori  I listen to the chords or whole riffs bouncing off the walls versus sound
in real time  Doing so I miss the actual song which is also delayed
because this is after all a recording  Once the concept of real time
was redundant  Before the first gramophone  Before we learned to
manipulate the speed of things to come  And long before that the idea
of a spirit that takes over for the temporary body was already popular 
Perhaps our first attempt to deny the unavoidable  One new religion
offers immortality  For a price  Unlike traditional religions in which
death is a prerequisite this one teaches the body to bypass the soul
that middle man who always gets in the way and the here-and-now
becomes a here-and-always  It’s all up here one of its members says to
me pointing his index finger at his temple as if mimicking a gun  I
may actually want to die before I get old I think the radio as loud as
it’ll go one chord after another bouncing off the walls so many years
ago at Leeds the road much longer than I’d expected the signal grow-
ing weaker and one station giving way to another  From feedback to
static to a preacher who invites me or commands me or dares me to
lay my hands on the radio  Both hands he says  I raise my legs raise
my whole body although it’s not levitation or anything nearly as glam-
orous to steady the steering wheel

In The Book of Ironies they forgot to write that a superstitious
woman will end up marrying an atheist  Curiously in all the cases I
know it’s the man who doesn’t believe  The woman is always open
at the very least to the possibility of that “something out there ” At
times her superstitions are proof of God’s constant tinkering with
the cogs and wheels of the soul  There are atheists with proof of a
finite world atheists in need of a finite world reformed atheists
whose image of God has become so pure over the years that it has
gone from inevitable to unnecessary to simply impossible  One
believer argues that only the next life makes this one tolerable and
lends it purpose that only the idea of being part of something cir-
cular can keep us from going mad because true madness is linear
and the points at either end are clearly defined  This is an uncom-
fortable thought for her  I wonder if her belief is more than any-
thing a way to keep at bay this linear derangement  The atheist lying
beside her is beginning to sink into sleep when she speaks she has
carefully chosen this moment thinking he’s vulnerable enough to
say what she wants to hear  He sits on the edge of the bed and won-
ders for a moment what it would be like to take that leap forward
or backward which is something she doesn’t mention believers of
her kind tend to discount any previous incarnations as if eternity
began here  Being here he says to himself as he has said to her so
many times is the point  Then he tries to think his way back to sleep
