
In the desolate depths of a perilous place
the bogeyman lurks with a snarl on his face 
Never dare never dare to approach his dark lair
for hes waiting       just waiting       to get you 
He skulks in the shadows relentless and wild
in his search for a tender delectable child 
With his steely sharp claws and his slavering jaws
oh hes waiting       just waiting       to get you 
Many have entered his dreary domain
but not even one has been heard from again 
They no doubt made a feast for the butchering beast
and hes waiting       just waiting       to get you 
In that sulphurous sunless and sinister place
hell crumple your bones in his bogey embrace 
Never never go near if you hold your life dear
for oh       what hell do       when he gets you
