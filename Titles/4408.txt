
I live a small life barely bigger than a speck
barely more than a blip on the radar sweep
though it is not nothing as the garter snake
climbs the rock rose shrub and the squirrel creeps
on bramble thorns  Not nothing to the crows
who heckle from the crowns of the last light’s trees
winterstripped of green except for the boles
that ivy winds each hour round  See the world is busy
and the world is quick barely time for a spider
to suck the juice from a hawk moth’s head
so it can use the moth as a spindle that it wraps in fiber
while the moth constricts until it’s thin as a stick
you might think was nothing a random bit
caught in a web coming loose from the window frame in wind
