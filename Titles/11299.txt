
I sometimes find him in the attic
lying on his side contemplating
the insulation  Or just staring at
the beams trying to get the measure
of force and distribution  He
turns up a lot in the garage 
I know he loves me  But if I look
away for an instant hes off
and I worry that he wont come back
or when he does hell have no taste
gone in for some fad Ill have to bear
and every move he makes a test 
But usually hes charming
following me to the cafe
and lying on the awning so carefully
as not to make it sag only
casting a slight shadow on my table 
Of course I act as though I
havent seen a thing  He only wants
I think to do what cant be done 
Why just yesterday for instance
I found him going through the public trash
figuring how to fill a bottle
some angry drunk had smashed
