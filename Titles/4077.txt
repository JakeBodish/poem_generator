
You can’t begin just anywhere  It’s a wreck 
                                                                                       Shrapnel and the eye
Of a house a row of houses  There’s a rat scrambling
From light with fleshy trash in its mouth  A baby strapped to its mother’s back
Cut loose                                                                      Soldiers crawl the city
The river the town the village
                                      The bedroom our kitchen  They eat everything 
Or burn it 
They kill what they cannot take  They rape  What they cannot kill they take 
Rumors fall like rain 
                                     Like bombs 
                 Like mother and father tears swallowed for restless peace                                      Like sunset slanting toward a moonless midnight 
Like a train blown free of its destination          Like a seed fallen where
There is no chance of trees                 or anyplace       for birds to live No start here                            Deer peer from the edge of the woods 
                                                                        We used to see woodpeckers
The size of the sun redbirds and were greeted
                                          By chickadees with their good morning songs 
We’d started to cook outside slippery with dew and laughter ah those smoky sweet sunrises 
We tried to pretend war wasn’t going to happen 
Though they began building their houses all around us and demanding  more 
They started teaching our children their god’s story
                                                               A story in which we’d always be slaves No  Not here 
You can’t begin here 
This is memory shredded because it is impossible to hold by words even poetry
