
One foot down then hop Its hot 
          Good things for the ones thats got 
Another jump now to the left 
          Everybody for hisself 
In the air now both feet down 
         Since you black dont stick around 
Food is gone the rent is due
          Curse and cry and then jump two 
All the people out of work
         Hold for three then twist and jerk 
Cross the line they count you out 
          Thats what hoppings all about 
Both feet flat the game is done 
They think I lost  I think I won
