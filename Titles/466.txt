
All at once that stubborn dog of a heart
stopped barking at Lady Poetry jumped
over the wall where the sacred crows of
Kashmir dwelt and said Ive come into
this world to stay  It cant be protested
the daffy nurses of Pickapoon Hospital 
It cant be the guardians of the public
order responded in chorus  All at once
that heart stopped leaping not in his
beloved Buenos Aires where hed mis-
placed his violin for good or in Ukraine
where José sawed timber and memorized
train schedules  That stubborn dog of a
heart kept singing in the face of turbulence
never knowing whether the Lady would
arrive  He put bars on his verses because
of issues with his lungs and thanked the
little birds that ate from his hand  He fed
the crows as well breadcrumbing hed
call it ringing a bell while quoting
mystics in their native tongues  This is
why Ive come hed say but all at once
that stubborn dog of a heart stopped
speaking and drew a giant moustache
high up in the spheres  You can see it
if you dare listen to their music
