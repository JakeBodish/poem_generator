
We’re sitting in Uncle Sam’s Subs splitting
a cheesesteak when Shelley saysI think I should buy a gun 
I look up at her puffy face and she’s staring
her hands shaking  On medication for
schizophrenia she’s serious 
I say Tell me why you need a gun 
Her voice getting louder You know why No no I don’t I say In case I need it  I might need it to shoot somebody 
I give her a hard look   You don’t need a gun 
No one is after you
