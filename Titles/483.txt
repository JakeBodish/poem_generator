
We feel the volt inside our veins
inside the vines inside the rain
and through the capillaries of
a tree  We feel the pulse above
in storms vibrato of thunder
the whispering rhythms of a river
magnetic currents in the earth
the alternating flow of breath
the push of tides reversing air
from caves dilating hum and dance
of bees the chant of auctioneer 
All oscillate together or
they seem to in this play of chance
beneath the stars indifference
