
The streets ram themselves into coochies
sodden women with bamboo for backs
 taffy for sex  Both sweet  sour 
Star-cloaked women who don’t bend
or break  Who catch Hondas right in they grills 
Women with electric-pink hoofs that drag
in the slow churn of the intersection  Clog
the sidewalks  Metastasize along the corridor
of Main Street  They have come to settle
around the bend of this corner  Pose
under carnival-like car lights at just nine-thirty 
Note It ain’t even prime time  they got all thatgood-good going on sale  The gully accordion
their arms sway in  out of tempo with traffic 
They stagger in  out of the busted frame of Pop’s
Grocery neon-blue open sign  Their smoke-thin throats
glitter when they slip into the ringing center of the motel lobby 
Strangled light bubbles  soaps along their jaws like melted crayons
through the Plexiglas  A rush of shade strains
against their nylon-clamped thighs rides up their hips
 dangles around their soft bellies as they saunter on in 
They be harvested sounds for the replay later this evening 
When they got to make it do what it do  When they got to
cash they own checks  Trace dollar signs into ceilings   signals
cut with their zirconia-encrusted toes 
Giggle  grunt at all the right moments
for the Best in Show
