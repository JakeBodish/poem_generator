
If theyd had writing in time Cuba could have been Crete
watery source of the Minoans and thus the Greeks 
Whats lost A possible us
growing like new foliage out of stony ground emerging
Last voice first a whole world calling 
awful inaudible into the unstoppable loud roaring
hurricane-force sea wind
