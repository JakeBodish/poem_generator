th only soundOf leaves and fuming rills Auroras fanLightly dispersd and the shrill Matin SongOf Birds on every bough so much the moreHis wonder was to find unwaknd EveWith Tresses discomposd and glowing CheekAs through unquiet rest he on his sideLeaning half-raisd with looks of cordial LoveHung over her enamourd and beheldBeautie which whether waking or asleepShot forth peculiar Graces then with voiceMilde as when Zephyrus on Flora breathesHer hand soft touching whisperd thus    AwakeMy fairest my espousd my latest foundHeavns last best gift my ever new delightAwake the morning shines and the fresh fieldCalls us we lose the prime to mark how springOur tended Plants how blows the Citron GroveWhat drops the Myrrhe and what the balmie ReedHow Nature paints her colours how the BeeSits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet Such whispering wakd her but with startld eyeOn Adam whom imbracing thus she spake O Sole in whom my thoughts find all reposeMy Glorie my Perfection glad I seeThy face and Morn returnd for I this NightSuch night till this I never passd have dreamdIf dreamd not as I oft am wont of theeWorks of day passt or morrows next designeBut of offence and trouble which my mindKnew never till this irksom night   methoughtClose at mine ear one calld me forth to walkWith gentle voice I though it thine it saidWhy sleepst thou Eve   now is the pleasant timeThe cool the silent save where silence yieldsTo the night-warbling Bird that now awakeTunes sweetest his love-labord song now reignesFull Orbd the Moon and with more pleasing lightShadowie sets off the face of things in vainIf none regard Heavn wakes with all his eyesWhom to behold but thee Natures desireIn whose sight all things joy with ravishmentAttracted by thy beauty still to gaze I rose as at thy call but found thee notTo find thee I directed then my walkAnd on methought alone I passd through waysThat brought me on a sudden to the TreeOf interdicted Knowledge fair it seemdMuch fairer to my Fancie then by dayAnd as I wondring lookt beside it stoodOne shapd and wingd like one of those from HeavnBy us oft seen his dewie locks distilldAmbrosia on that Tree he also gazdAnd O fair Plant said he with fruit surchargdDeigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweetNor God nor Man is Knowledge so despisdOr envie or what reserve forbids to tasteForbid who will none shall from me withholdLonger thy offerd good why else set hereThis said he pausd not but with ventrous ArmeHe pluckt he tasted mee damp horror childAt such bold words voucht with a deed so boldBut he thus overjoyd O Fruit DivineSweet of thy self but much more sweet thus croptForbiddn here it seems as onely fitFor Gods yet able to make Gods of MenAnd why not Gods of Men since good the moreCommunicated more abundant growesThe Author not impaird but honourd moreHere happie Creature fair Angelic EvePartake thou also happie though thou artHappier thou mayst be worthier canst not beTaste this and be henceforth among the GodsThy self a Goddess not to Earth confindBut somtimes in the Air as wee somtimesAscend to Heavn by merit thine and seeWhat life the Gods live there and such live thou So saying he drew nigh and to me heldEven to my mouth of that same fruit held partWhich he had pluckt the pleasant savourie smellSo quicknd appetite that I methoughtCould not but taste    Forthwith up to the CloudsWith him I flew and underneath beheldThe Earth outstretcht immense a prospect wideAnd various wondring at my flight and changeTo this high exaltation suddenlyMy Guide was gon and I me thought sunk downAnd fell asleep but O how glad I wakdTo find this but a dream   Thus Eve her NightRelated and thus Adam answerd sad Best image of my self and dearer halfThe trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleepAffects me equally nor can I likeThis uncouth dream of evil sprung I fearYet evil whence in thee can harbour noneCreated pure    But know that in the SouleAre many lesser Faculties that serveReason as chief among these Fansie nextHer office holds of all external thingsWhich the five watchful Senses representShe forms Imaginations Aerie shapesWhich Reason joyning or disjoyning framesAll what we affirm or what deny and callOur knowledge or opinion then retiresInto her private Cell when Nature restsOft in her absence mimic Fansie wakesTo imitate her but misjoyning shapesWilde work produces oft and most in dreamsIll matching words and deeds long past or late Som such resemblances methinks I findOf our last Eevnings talk in this thy dreamBut with addition strange yet be not sad Evil into the mind of God or ManMay come or go so unapprovd and leaveNo spot or blame behind Which gives me hopeThat what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dreamWaking thou never wilt consent to do Be not disheartnd then nor cloud those looksThat wont to be more chearful and sereneThen when fair Morning first smiles on the WorldAnd let us to our fresh imployments riseAmong the Groves the Fountains and the FloursThat open now thir choicest bosomd smellsReservd from night and kept for thee in store So cheard he his fair Spouse and she was cheardBut silently a gentle tear let fallFrom either eye and wipd them with her haireTwo other precious drops that ready stoodEach in thir Chrystal sluce hee ere they fellKissd as the gracious signs of sweet remorseAnd pious awe that feard to have offended So all was cleard and to the Field they haste But first from under shadie arborous roofSoon as they forth were come to open sightOf day-spring and the Sun who scarce up risenWith wheels yet hovring ore the Ocean brimShot paralel
