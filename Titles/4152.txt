     exit strategies  Crotch but a bumper sticker
in a heretofore-fleeting waterloo  Crunk repentance  I span
our doomed alphabet soup like Jane Fonda’s antiwar legs
     in calisthenic videos  My zenith of hair a brown
          wannabe-Fawcett mean-ole-toucan pupic papa    
He who so feeds on an entire corpus and still
starves helms the colloquium outside the bathroom
of transubstantiation Tonight   a vastly archived Nietzschean
nighttime   I anal bleach my humpty-
dumpty stigmatas 
     Boys conch with crimson Hollywood carpets that disentangle
from their cavities accustoming their catwalks upon the blood
clots of their mamacitas  As twilight uncrowns the shade
     I howl effluvium switchblade hue
to hue  I plié before the gas cloud lifting jumbo leaves 
Like a mythic infantry the thirsty roaches begin to leatherflock
