
I will die in Paris with a rainstorm
on a day I already remember
I will die in Paris and I dont shy away 
perhaps on a Thursday as today is in autumn 
       It will be Thursday because today Thursday as I prose
these lines Ive put on my humeri in a bad mood   
and today like never before Ive turned back
with all of my road to see myself alone 
       César Vallejo has died they kept hitting him   
everyone even though he does nothing to them
they gave it to him hard with a club and hard
       also with a rope witnesses are
the Thursday days and the humerus bones   
the solitude the rain the roads
