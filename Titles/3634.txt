
Covet not the sun its honorarium
nor authorize the stars their grants to write 
The sojournors spotted a forest
adrift with language but couldnt make sense of it 
The woods at odds with the usual channels
and those neighboring mountains
didnt look like pyramids no matter the scale 
Read this part as if the sum of lilac
mattered to you  For love of someone
elses vortex toss the luminaries aside 
In lieu of flowers please donate
and in exchange for your sympathy Ill give you
edits on the level of the line  Poems are to war
as are ghosts to the proverbial orchard  
Headstones offer us nothing
but an end to syntax  Microsoft 
Word inverts the sea  I read
your manuscript  Reader I married it 
I fear for the estuaries 
They are so small this time of year
