
To make beauty out of pain it damns the eyes No dams the eyes  See how they overflowNo damns them damns them and so they cry What shape can I swallow to make me wholeBaby’s bird-shaped block blue-painted woodThat fits in the bird-hole of the painted wood boxThe skeleton leaf The skeleton key LoudKnock when the shape won’t unlock any locks I hear it through the static in the baby’s roomWhen the monitor clicks on and off soundOf sea-ice cracking against the jagged sea-rocksLaughing gull in the gale  What is it dives downPast sight down there dark with the other blocksIt can’t be seen only heard  A kind of curseThis kind curse  Forgive me  Blessing that hurts
