
Deeply repentant of my sinful waysAnd of my trivial manifold desiresOf squandering alas these few brief daysOf fugitive life in tending loves vain firesTo Thee Lord Who dost move hard hearts againAnd render warmth unto the frozen snowAnd lighten every bitter load of painFor those who with Thy sacred ardours glow   To Thee I turn O stretch forth Thy right handAnd from this whirlpool rescue me for IWithout Thine aid could never reach the landO willingly for us didst suffer lossAnd to redeem mankind hung on the CrossO gentle Saviour leave me not to die
