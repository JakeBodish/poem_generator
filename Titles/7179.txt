
My little Son who lookd from thoughtful eyesAnd moved and spoke in quiet grown-up wiseHaving my law the seventh time disobeydI struck him and dismissdWith hard words and unkissdHis Mother who was patient being dead Then fearing lest his grief should hinder sleepI visited his bedBut found him slumbering deepWith darkend eyelids and their lashes yetFrom his late sobbing wet And I with moanKissing away his tears left others of my ownFor on a table drawn beside his headHe had put within his reachA box of counters and a red-veind stoneA piece of glass abraded by the beachAnd six or seven shellsA bottle with bluebellsAnd two French copper coins ranged there with careful artTo comfort his sad heart So when that night I praydTo God I wept and saidAh when at last we lie with tranced breathNot vexing Thee in deathAnd Thou rememberest of what toysWe made our joysHow weakly understoodThy great commanded goodThen fatherly not lessThan I whom Thou hast moulded from the clayThoult leave Thy wrath and sayI will be sorry for their childishness
