
The wintry west extends his blastAnd hail and rain does blawOr the stormy north sends driving forthThe blinding sleet and snawWhile tumbling brown the burn comes downAnd roars frae bank to braeAnd bird and beast in covert restAnd pass the heartless day The sweeping blast the sky o’ercastThe joyless winter-dayLet others fear to me more dearThan all the pride of MayThe tempest’s howl it soothes my soulMy griefs it seems to joinThe leafless trees my fancy pleaseTheir fate resembles mineThou Pow’r Supreme whose mighty schemeThese woes of mine fulfilHere firm I rest they must be bestBecause they are Thy willThen all I want O do Thou grantThis one request of mineSince to enjoy Thou dost denyAssist me to resign
