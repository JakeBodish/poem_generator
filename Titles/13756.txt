
Isnt the moon dark too  most of the time  And doesnt the white page  seem unfinished  without the dark stain  of alphabets  When God demanded light  he didnt banish darkness   Instead he invented  ebony and crows  and that small mole  on your left cheekbone   Or did you mean to ask  Why are you sad so often  Ask the moon   Ask what it has witnessed
