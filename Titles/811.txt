
Tracks are all that define these voices
hungry lives pulsing sacred ground 
We are a journey of distressed shapes
red essence on parchment occupying a life 
We look for the fated four-legged that paced
this way a tested and well-worn path
among storms mud into this shared hidden
brush  Coyote slipping by through old
winter grass warns in a pagan tongue
licking after our scent  We pick up pace
tighten our careless reins snap back at the
yellow-eyed clown with throat hunger
that gnawing bone that drives us on  Quieted
we hear the heart beating  A desperate breath
crashes through dry branches a silhouette
give away  In an instant we let go
of weapons and invite a quick death  We
watch our knives glistening  Obsidian
works for us  What image of blood on flesh
odor of iron  A vermilion sun heavy with
spring looks upon reflections of death
in hard visions our favorable hunt 
whitetail not quick enough for downwind
lessons  Our horses burdened deer shadows
left on landscape we push forward 
These tracks ours now  Game will heal all 
Our offspring dance Grandmother prepares a
fire and sharpens another knife  During the
feast we thank any god absent from our table
