Not in stock says the campus bookstore clerk looking up from his screen with a smile when I inquire incognito after my books which are nowhere to be found on the shelves  We used to have two copies of the first one he says but no one bought them so we sent them back last June  We never carried the second one he adds but we could order it for you  What’s your name I glance up above his head at a shelf of Staff Picks  Between a history of disgust and a guide for saving the planet I spot my husband’s last book gleaming in the day’s dying light  Forget it I mutter into my muffler I can get it from Amazon by Friday  I go home and order an ivory satin pillowcase instead guaranteed to reduce hair loss due to breakage and soften fine lines

E-cigarettes 
A babysitter whose babysitter is sick 
Nunchucks at a gunfight 
Stiletto heels at the beach 
Last year’s flu shot

Heian courtesans slept lightly when they slept at all fully dressed in perfumed robes on straw mats behind elabroately painted screens upon which their noble visitors knocked softly at all hours  In their onnade “women’s script” they kept detailed notes about flowers festivals and furtive trysts on delicately tinted pages stashed in narrow drawers inside their pillows  These documents copied and recopied over the centuries by courtiers monks and scholars in a relentlessly modernizing Japan provide readers today with the richest portrait of any culture of its time on the globe  I now had a vast quantity of paper at my disposal reports the nonchalant Shōnagon and I set about filling the notebooks with odd facts stories from the past and all sorts of other things often including the most trivial material 
 


 
All day I lie sprawled across my pillow watching a light crust of  snow retract across the lawn into a thin band of shade along the  fence  I watch the sun fail to rise above the Japanese maple and  drop like a coin into a slot in the wall
