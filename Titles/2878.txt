forms of transportation a woman read Daniel Deronda
until the year became the arbitrary pink
the calendar chose for the middle of winter 
And finally she sat in the reference section
of the public library finishing Daniel Deronda
for days at a slowing pace between piecesof newspapers and foreign language newspaperswhose syntax she enjoyed not understanding And when she didnt anymore she wrote in the marginsof Daniel Deronda for someonewho might never see  Thought of that personwho might never see staring equally at the rain equallythinking of her and of nothing in particular Outside the news fell apart  If one choosesto be shallow or noble or oneis born so and if it matters  Translationsare appropriate when Nature is dormant or when onehas nothing to say or does not knowwhat to say  These are three different thingsbut sometimes they are the same It is not wrong to want nice things neitheris it wrong to want to be good or to feel thatas a physical force of pleasure Daniel Derondawho does not know who he iswho thinks he does and goes away on a boat But the cover is a picture of a woman gambling The air warms outside the referencesection and also the rain  Incomprehensible news Whenever a book ends silence as if a stewardship had ceased A person can feel the bones of ones hands by stretching them If love comes again know better than to speak
