
Snow is a strange white word
No ice or frost
Have asked of bud or bird
For Winters cost 
Yet ice and frost and snow
From earth to sky
This Summer land doth know
No man knows why 
In all mens hearts it is 
Some spirit old
Hath turned with malign kiss
Our lives to mould 
Red fangs have torn His face 
Gods blood is shed 
He mourns from His lone place
His children dead 
O ancient crimson curse
Corrode consume 
Give back this universe
Its pristine bloom
