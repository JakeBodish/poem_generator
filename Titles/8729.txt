
“The writer  It’s a cul-de-sac” you wrote that
winter of our nation’s discontent  That first time
I found you blue marble lying still in the trench you staked
in waiting for something anything but the cell of your small
apartment with the fixtures never scrubbed the seven great
named cats you gassed in the move  I couldn’t keep them 
You explained so I understood  And what cat never loved
your shell-like ways the claw of your steady fingers firme
from the rasping of banjos and steady as it goes
from the nose to the hair to the shaking tip  My favorite
tale was of the owl and the pussycat in love in a china cup
cast at sea or in a flute more brittle more lifelike
and riddled with flair the exquisite polish of its gaudy
glaze now puzzled with heat cracks now foamed
opalescent as the single espresso dish you bought from
Goodwill  What ever becomes of the heart our common
child fashioned red silk and golden satin the gay glitter
fallen from moves our names with Love written in black
felt pen Who gets what Who knows what becomes of the
rose you carried home from Spanish Harlem that morning
I sat waiting for the surgeon’s suction  What ever becomes
of waiting and wanting when the princess isn’t ready and
the queen has missed the boat again Do you still write
those old remarks etched on a page of Kandinsky’s ace
letting go Like Lorna meets Oliver North and she
kicks his butt
