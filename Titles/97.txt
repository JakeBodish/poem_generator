
Taking on an aspect of the Orient
Skies full of hatchets and oranges
Love uninvited hangs in the blood
But what is a kingdom to a dying emperor
 
Skies full of hatchets and oranges
Keep the birds singing sorrows fresh 
But what is a kingdom to a dying emperor
As the nights grow steadily into mountains 
 
Keep the birds singing sorrows fresh 
The princess braids these into a necklace
As the nights grow steadily into mountains
Why even regrets recede unexpectedly 
 
The princess braids these into a necklace
Roads and rivers that lead away from the palace 
Why even regrets recede unexpectedly
In a solitude full of wars and songs 
 
Roads and rivers that lead away from the palace
Never converge in that vast landscape
In a solitude full of wars and songs
The words remain light and fugitive 
 
Never converge in that vast landscape
In the way that stars keep their distance 
The words remain light and fugitive
In an anticipation crossed with absence 
In the way that stars keep their distance
Love uninvited hangs in the blood
In an anticipation crossed with absence
Taking on an aspect of the Orient
