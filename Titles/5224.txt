
What if   it were possible to vanquishAll this shame with a wash of   varnishInstead of wishing the stain would vanishWhat if   you gave it a glossy finishWhat if   there were a way to burnishAll this foolishness all the anguishWhat if   you gave yourself   leave to ravishAll these ravages with famished relishWhat if   this were your way to flourishWhat if   the self   you love to punish  Knavish peevish wolfish sheepish  Were all slicked up in something lavishWhy so squeamish Why make a fetishOut of everything you must relinquishWhy not embellish what you can’t abolishWhat would be left if   you couldn’t brandishAll the slavishness you’ve failed to banishWhat would you be without this gibberishWhat if   the true worth of the varnishWere to replenish your resolve to vanquishEvery vain wish before you vanish
