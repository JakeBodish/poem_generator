
When I remember plain heroic strengthAnd shining virtue shown by Ypres poolsThen read the blither written by knaves for foolsIn praise of English soldiers lying at lengthWho purely dream what England shall be madeGloriously new free of the old stainsBy us who pay the price that must be paidWill freeze all winter over Ypres plains Our silly dreams of peace you put asideAnd brotherhood of man for you will seeAn armed mistress braggart of the tideHer children slaves under your mastery Well have a word there too and forge a knifeWill cut the cancer threatens Englands life
