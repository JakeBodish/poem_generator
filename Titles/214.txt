
After my father died my mother
and my sisters picked the shirt the tie
he had just the one suit 
I left them to it I didnt
want to choose I loved him
all those years  They took a shirt
from the closet I dont remember
which one Im sure he had worn it
to church and hung it up again 
They held a tie against the cloth
of the shirt  They decided finally 
Its like that  Things come down
to the pale blue or the white
or some other  Someone buttoned it
over him those buttons he had unbuttoned
