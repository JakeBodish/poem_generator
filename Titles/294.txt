
And yesterday something shattering happened 
Not yesterday but several that’s becoming
a favorite word weeks ago I came across
Kitaj’s The Jewish Rider and wept
there he was in the very image of my stepfather
the pate where a few strands of hair still frolic
the same skinny legs the same misguided
attempt to dress in a sporty way who’s
watching the same abstractedness
the same shlumpy boneless posture gazing not
at the landscape flashing past
with wires lashed to the treetops as if with one
tug the countryside would vanish
or listening to the tick of the rails
but fixed distractedly on his lower extremities
white loafers and the crease in his pants and nylon
socks to see whether or not he should roll them up … 
no looking both beyond and through physical space
into an inner dark  Why else draw the eyes as shadows
It’s his glimpse into another world 
 
                                                                
 
My mother’s father hunted and rode 
        My father rode and fished 
My stepfather never budged
        from his Barca Lounger
once the amber liquid began to pour  He had a spiritual life
and a social life and no
        physical life  But he liked it
that I was always outside
        maybe that’s why he never
got on my back about grades
        he might have thought
that this boy has to be outside
        at this time in his life  
Maybe it’s more important
        that he roam the canyons and the hills 
that he know the streets 
        that he come home 
covered with leaves and bark and mud
        than that he sit there 
like a good young scholar 
        like I was a Rabbi 
at twenty giving money home
        to my parents in their cabbagy tenement 
in the Bronx  This is a boy
        who needs space  One time 
I think I had my learners permit 
        he rented a Mustang
convertible in L A  and for several
        days I drove around
past the long rows of used car lots
        and the bruised facades of restaurants
digging up relatives my hoarse-voiced
        arthritic aunt in the shadows of
her goldenrod colored ranch house
        limping like Ruffian
after her last run
        in the wet dirt at Belmont Stakes 
       
                                                                 
 
But I’ve said nothing about what made me weep 
 
Its in the contrast between Kitajs alter cocker
seeking comfort on a train
and Rembrandt’s taut youth
setting off into the rampant amber on horseback
it’s in the image of active life juxtaposed
with the image of sedentary contemplation 
though no one travels on horseback now
and heroism has become
attending AIDS patients
or sheltering the homeless 
The raw youth’s feet are planted
lightly yet firmly in his stirrups 
His coat glows with many colors 
 
Not so The Jewish Rider 
And yet theres something more 
 
                                                             
 
Michael Hoffman writes that New York
is not what it was when I was too young
to have marked the existence of The Blue Note
but I can pick up this trail
by walking across the park to the Frick 
And Barbara Hershey wouldn’t have been at the Frick in 1959
they don’t allow children under sixteen
in black skin tight pants black sweater
the female uniform of our generation
whose male version substitutes
black jeans baseball hat and bomber jacket 
though who knows what decorous garments
she’d checked in the cloakroom
and white boots with plenty
of Elizabethan ruff at the edges
pausing to look at The Polish Rider
while I scribbled notes  Her white
boots stood out against the dominant dark
like the Jewish Rider’s white loafers 
 
And that was good because the light in the painting is brief
whatever the time of day sunrise or sunset
and the rider’s gaze looking out over
unknown space is inward 
I followed his eyes through the archway toward canvases
where clouds roll over harbors
against the whiteness of sails
or toward gilded robes and velvet-hung rooms
then back to meet wisdom’s bared breast
in Veronese’s Wisdom and Strength…
Why didn’t Veronese have the nerve
to call his painting Woman
With Bare Breasts like Tintoretto
Why an allegorical title when the bare
flesh and bones and sinew would have done
He spends his life looking not
at far off hills or citadels or
the lights in the village below
he has no choice but to fix
on her one bared breast her swelling nipple 
I can’t figure out what landscape
he might be facing in the painted world 
The clatter of rocks and hooves
echoes over the stony plain 
 
                                                                 
 
I was no rider but a pretend
horse and rider always rode
beside my train window at a canter
no matter how fast the rails clicked by 
and though he wore a bandana
and leaned slightly forward in the saddle
to pull himself aboard
his gaze wide-ranging yet intent
was like the Polish Rider’s 
 
Even as an only child I was never lonely 
 
My mothers father rode until he was old
and on a narrow pass his horse
jammed him up against rockface 
In his narrative of his life
this collision marked
the ruin of his hip
the rise of his cataracts 
 
My father rode “every morning before work ”
 
I never witnessed that
but at a ranch in upper New York State
while I bloodied my hands
tugging the reins of a frothing giant
who would not budge from a weedpatch
I watched him disappear
in his black polo shirt and khaki jodhpurs
as he galloped over a far off hill
more at ease in the saddle in the air 
than I’d ever seen him in civilian life 
 
My woman friend in El Paso lives to ride 
 
Only the Jewish Rider and I do not ride
 
                                                                  
 
That’s the stuff of events  What about
the signature inscribed by the sun
the dark clouds sinister in just being there
thresholds exchanges going on in the village below
candles lit in the deep interiors
bread wine the plate making its way
around the table what about 
 
leaping centuries ahead 
the energy from generators blazing
like auras through the clouds
the scattered lights
the rotating tops of ambulances
the tuna casseroles and macaroni and cheese
 
making the rounds apple sauce
passing from high chair to bib the Wonder Bread
on a calcified plate
children eating heads down in silence
communicating through eye movements
the mother wiping her lips the father
grinning stupidly and drooling
 
the television quacking in the background
the perfect suburban night unfolding
in bedroom and drive-in and den
the sprinkler system ticking 
The snipers in the tower  
This is what the riders
guests everywhere and nowhere
 
say goodbye to as their horses break into a canter
as night comes down  And last
night driving to Connecticut
I understood that the Polish Rider
gleans the permutations of light after dusk
that its olive-gray smudges reflect
the absence of pitch-darkness  I was wrong
 
about the Polish Rider all along
he doesn’t depart at nightfall he stops for a moment
crossing difficult terrain anticipating rockslide
in the night because as the faint light
rimming the edges of the sky makes clear
night is not absolute black but rough-hewn and curious 
The rider lives in order to depart 
 
 
                                 The Woman Who Rode
 
She hitched her horse to the gateposts of my house 
Bare trees frost the whole bit 
 
I wanted our lives to be like that
as rife with silences as a Quaker meeting 
 
She came to me in her stride 
Dropped her crop on the chair 
 
Peeled off her britches and boots crawled
under the covers 
 
Her hour in the saddle had “made her ready ”
I felt like an accessory 
 
The wound was open  Drowsily I rolled
onto her no longer caring if she
 
was using me  As the new
year wore on and black ice made riding
 
a fast track to certain death
or paralysis she grew tense 
 
Came to me now with clinical terms
“schi” words I worked hard to break down 
 
The good news was she was not a true
“split personality” the glitch
 
that “she was divorced
from herself and could not love or care ”
 
                                                                  
 
The light in her house
was like the light before dawn 
 
On the last of my rare visits
her mother jarred preserves while we watched
 
instant replays of Robert Kennedy die and die 
Her father skulked upstairs perhaps
 
testing gadgets or wishing me off his daughter
or taking precautions I would not overhear
 
what words were ricocheting
on his “hot line” to the patent office 
 
                                                                 
 
Any objective observer standing back
from the distraction of the impinging present
 
could see that her torment overleapt
any visible signs and that she was 
 
as a WASP “rider” the wrong
person for the place she was in 
 
Her resilience could not be in question 
She lived to stray from known paths
 
to leap stone fences and break into open fields 
When her horse went down in an Irish bog
 
and she was trampled hooves branding her cheek 
the next day she up and mounted him again 
 
                                                                
 
When she came to me in the dream last night
her smile had loosened 
 
How lovely she looked in her blue silk blouse 
How well it lit up the colors of her hair
