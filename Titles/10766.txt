
jumpsuits they have changed
            painting I
behind the concertina wire
cant look at it anymore that wall
across which shadows play
Sorry to be vague
            at such an hour  Were you
When I called I heard
            my voice
anywhere near waking
            in the background
Strange reversible lines I thought
he was dead  He is
better of it pushing the glass
away  How many songs
            can it hold that thing
Ive seen in windows has it changed
            singing or
hooded figures
            I didnt know
it had a camera some features are
The blue of links obscure
beneath the face the green
We still dont have a word for
            Simulated drowning in
embedded streams
            a perfect world
