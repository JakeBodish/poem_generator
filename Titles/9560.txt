
The vase was made of clay
With spines of straw
For strength  The sunbaked vase
Soaked in a deep blue dye for days  The events in this wilderness
Portrayed in the round of the vase
Depend on shades of indigo against
The masked areas of the clay a flat pearl color
To detail the big sky and snow   
This Montana field in winter is not sorrowful
A bugle skips through notes
We view it all somehow from the center of the field
And there are scattered groups of cavalry  Some of these
Men were seasoned by civil war  Their caps are blue 
Their canteens are frozen  The horses shake their heads
Bothered by beads of ice the needles of ice
Forming at both sides of their great anvil heads 
The long blue cloaks of the officers fall over the haunches
Of the horses  The ammunition wagons
Beside the woods are blurred by the snowy weather   
Beyond the wagons farther even into the woods
There is a sloping streambed  This is
The dark side of the vase which is often misunderstood 
From here through the bare trees there’s
A strange sight to be seen at the very middle of the field
A valet is holding a bowl of cherries archetype and rubric
A general with white hair eats the fruit while introducing its color
Which will flow through the woods in early December 
An Indian woman came under dark clouds to give birth unattended
In the deep wash inside the woods  She knew the weather
Could turn and staked the tips of two rooted spruce trees
To the earth to make a roof 
The deerskin of her robe is in her mouth  Her legs spread
He feet are tied up in the roof of darkening spruce  No stars
Show through
