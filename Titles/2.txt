
Look for me under the hood
of that old Chevrolet settled in weeds
at the end of the pasture 
Im the radiator that spent its years
bolted in front of an engine
shoving me forward into the wind 
Whatever was in me in those days
has mostly leaked away
but my caps still screwed on tight
and I know the names of all these
tattered moths and broken grasshoppers
the rest of youve forgotten
