
We remember so little
We are certain of nothing 
We long to perish into the absolute 
Where is a mountain
To spread its snowfields for us like a shawl
You might beginThe men who come to see me are not exactly lovers 
Or Seen at a distance the gazelle is blue 
That’s just your way of cheering me up 
You might beginThe quality of the telegram is vulnerable 
Or even The spirit of the telegram is virginal 
By now I am ravenous 
You might beginNothing’s more passionate than a train
Entering an enormous depot
Empty except for two lovers irreconcilable
Parting
