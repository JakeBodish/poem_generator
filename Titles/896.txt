what recompence Equal have I to render thee Divine Hystorian who thus largely hast allayd The thirst I had of knowledge and voutsaft This friendly condescention to relate Things else by me unsearchable now heard With wonder but delight and as is due With glorie attributed to the high Creator something yet of doubt remaines Which onely thy solution can resolve  When I behold this goodly Frame this World Of Heavn and Earth consisting and compute Thir magnitudes this Earth a spot a graine An Atom with the Firmament compard And all her numberd Starrs that seem to rowle Spaces incomprehensible for such Thir distance argues and thir swift return Diurnal meerly to officiate light Round this opacous Earth this punctual spot One day and night in all thir vast survey Useless besides reasoning I oft admire How Nature wise and frugal could commit Such disproportions with superfluous hand So many nobler Bodies to create Greater so manifold to this one use For aught appeers and on thir Orbs impose Such restless revolution day by day Repeated while the sedentarie Earth That better might with farr less compass move Servd by more noble then her self attaines Her end without least motion and receaves As Tribute such a sumless journey brought Of incorporeal speed her warmth and light Speed to describe whose swiftness Number failes  So spake our Sire and by his countnance seemd Entring on studious thoughts abstruse which Eve Perceaving where she sat retird in sight With lowliness Majestic from her seat And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay Rose and went forth among her Fruits and Flours To visit how they prosperd bud and bloom Her Nurserie they at her coming sprung And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew  Yet went she not as not with such discourse Delighted or not capable her eare Of what was high such pleasure she reservd Adam relating she sole Auditress Her Husband the Relater she preferrd Before the Angel and of him to ask Chose rather hee she knew would intermix Grateful digressions and solve high dispute With conjugal Caresses from his Lip Not Words alone pleasd her    O when meet now Such pairs in Love and mutual Honour joynd With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went Not unattended for on her as Queen A pomp of winning Graces waited still And from about her shot Darts of desire Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight  And Raphael now to Adams doubt proposd Benevolent and facil thus replid  To ask or search I blame thee not for Heavn Is as the Book of God before thee set Wherein to read his wondrous Works and learne His Seasons Hours or Dayes or Months or Yeares This to attain whether Heavn move or Earth Imports not if thou reckn right the rest From Man or Angel the great Architect Did wisely to conceal and not divulge His secrets to be scannd by them who ought Rather admire or if they list to try Conjecture he his Fabric of the Heavns Hath left to thir disputes perhaps to move His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide Hereafter when they come to model Heavn And calculate the Starrs how they will weild The mightie frame how build unbuild contrive To save appeerances how gird the Sphear With Centric and Eccentric scribld ore Cycle and Epicycle Orb in Orb Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess Who art to lead thy ofspring and supposest That bodies bright and greater should not serve The less not bright nor Heavn such journies run Earth sitting still when she alone receaves The benefit consider first that Great Or Bright inferrs not Excellence the Earth Though in comparison of Heavn so small Nor glistering may of solid good containe More plenty then the Sun that barren shines Whose vertue on it self workes no effect But in the fruitful Earth there first receavd His beams unactive else thir vigour find  Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries Officious but to thee Earths habitant  And for the Heavns wide Circuit let it speak The Makers high magnificence who built So spacious and his Line stretcht out so farr That Man may know he dwells not in his own An Edifice too large for him to fill Lodgd in a small partition and the rest Ordaind for uses to his Lord best known  The swiftness of those Circles attribute Though numberless to his Omnipotence That to corporeal substances could adde Speed almost Spiritual mee thou thinkst not slow Who since the Morning hour set out from Heavn Where God resides and ere mid-day arrivd In Eden distance inexpressible By Numbers that have name    But this I urge Admitting Motion in the Heavns to shew Invalid that which thee to doubt it movd Not that I so affirm though so it seem To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth  God to remove his wayes from human sense Placd Heavn from Earth so farr that earthly sight If it presume might erre in things too high And no advantage gaine    What if the Sun Be Center to the World and other Starrs By his attractive vertue and thir own Incited dance about him various rounds Thir wandring course now high now low then hid Progressive retrograde or standing still In six thou seest and what if sevnth to these The Planet Earth so stedfast though she seem Insensibly three different Motions move Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe Movd contrarie with thwart obliquities Or save the Sun his labour and that swift Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb supposd Invisible else above all Starrs the Wheele Of Day and Night which needs not thy beleefe If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day Travelling East and with her part averse From the Suns beam meet Night her other part Still luminous by his ray    What if that light Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr Enlightning her by Day as she by Night This Earth reciprocal if Land be there Feilds and Inhabitants Her spots thou seest As Clouds and Clouds may rain and Rain produce Fruits in her softnd Soile for some to eate Allotted there and other Suns perhaps With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie Communicating Male and Femal Light Which two great Sexes animate the World Stord in each Orb perhaps with some that live  For such vast room in Nature unpossest By living Soule desert and desolate Onely to shine yet scarce to contribute Each Orb a glimps of Light conveyd so farr Down to this habitable which returnes Light back to them is obvious to dispute  But whether thus these things or whether not Whether the Sun predominant in Heavn Rise on the Earth or Earth rise on the Sun Hee from the East his flaming rode begin Or Shee from West her silent course advance With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps On her soft Axle while she paces Eevn And beares thee soft with the smooth Air along Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid Leave them to God above him serve and feare Of other Creatures as him pleases best Wherever plact let him dispose joy thou In what he gives to thee this Paradise And thy faire Eve Heavn is for thee too high To know what passes there be lowlie wise  Think onely what concernes thee and thy being Dream not of other Worlds what Creatures there Live in what state condition or degree Contented that thus farr hath been reveald Not of Earth onely but of highest Heavn  To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt replid  How fully hast thou satisfid mee pure Intelligence of Heavn Angel serene And freed from intricacies taught to live The easiest way nor with perplexing thoughts To interrupt the sweet of Life from which God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares And not molest us unless we our selves Seek them with wandring thoughts and notions vain  But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave Uncheckt and of her roaving is no end Till warnd or by experience taught she learne That not to know at large of things remote From use obscure and suttle but to know That which before us lies in daily life Is the prime Wisdom what is more is fume Or emptiness or fond impertinence And renders us in things that most concerne Unpractisd unprepard and still to seek  Therefore from this high pitch let us descend A lower flight and speak of things at hand Useful whence haply mention may arise Of somthing not unseasonable to ask By sufferance and thy wonted favour deignd  Thee I have heard relating what was don Ere my remembrance now hear mee relate My Storie which perhaps thou hast not heard And Day is yet not spent till then thou seest How suttly to detaine thee I devise Inviting thee to hear while I relate Fond were it not in hope of thy reply For while I sit with thee I seem in Heavn And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst And hunger both from labour at the houre Of sweet repast they satiate and soon fill Though pleasant but thy words with Grace Divine Imbud bring to thir sweetness no satietie  To whom thus Raphael answerd heavnly meek  Nor are thy lips ungraceful Sire of men Nor tongue ineloquent for God on thee Abundantly his gifts hath also pourd Inward and outward both his image faire Speaking or mute all comliness and grace Attends thee and each word each motion formes Nor less think wee in Heavn of thee on Earth Then of our fellow servant and inquire Gladly into the wayes of God with Man For God we see hath honourd thee and set On Man his Equal Love say therefore on For I that Day was absent as befell Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell Squard in full Legion such command we had To see that none thence issud forth a spie Or enemie while God was in his work Least hee incenst at such eruption bold Destruction with Creation might have mixt  Not that they durst without his leave attempt But us he sends upon his high behests For state as Sovran King and to enure Our prompt obedience    Fast we found fast shut The dismal Gates and barricadod strong But long ere our approaching heard within Noise other then the sound of Dance or Song Torment and loud lament and furious rage  Glad we returnd up to the coasts of Light Ere Sabbath Eevning so we had in charge  But thy relation now for I attend Pleasd with thy words no less then thou with mine  So spake the Godlike Power and thus our Sire  For Man to tell how human Life began Is hard for who himself beginning knew Desire with thee still longer to converse Inducd me    As new wakt from soundest sleep Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid In Balmie Sweat which with his Beames the Sun Soon drid and on the reaking moisture fed  Strait toward Heavn my wondring Eyes I turnd And gazd a while the ample Skie till raisd By quick instinctive motion up I sprung As thitherward endevoring and upright Stood on my feet about me round I saw Hill Dale and shadie Woods and sunnie Plaines And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams by these Creatures that livd and movd and walkd or flew Birds on the branches warbling all things smild With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflowd  My self I then perusd and Limb by Limb Surveyd and sometimes went and sometimes ran With supple joints and lively vigour led But who I was or where or from what cause Knew not to speak I trid and forthwith spake My Tongue obeyd and readily could name What ere I saw    Thou Sun said I faire Light And thou enlightnd Earth so fresh and gay Ye Hills and Dales ye Rivers Woods and Plaines And ye that live and move fair Creatures tell Tell if ye saw how came I thus how here Not of my self by some great Maker then In goodness and in power praeeminent Tell me how may I know him how adore From whom I have that thus I move and live And feel that I am happier then I know  While thus I calld and strayd I knew not whither From where I first drew Aire and first beheld This happie Light when answer none returnd On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours Pensive I sate me down there gentle sleep First found me and with soft oppression seisd My droused sense untroubld though I thought I then was passing to my former state Insensible and forthwith to dissolve When suddenly stood at my Head a dream Whose inward apparition gently movd My fancy to believe I yet had being And livd One came methought of shape Divine And said thy Mansion wants thee Adam rise First Man of Men innumerable ordaind First Father calld by thee I come thy Guide To the Garden of bliss thy seat prepard  So saying by the hand he took me raisd And over Fields and Waters as in Aire Smooth sliding without step last led me up A woodie Mountain whose high top was plaine A Circuit wide enclosd with goodliest Trees Planted with Walks and Bowers that what I saw Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemd    Each Tree Loadn with fairest Fruit that hung to the Eye Tempting stirrd in me sudden appetite To pluck and eate whereat I wakd and found Before mine Eyes all real as the dream Had lively shadowd Here had new begun My wandring had not hee who was my Guide Up hither from among the Trees appeerd Presence Divine    Rejoycing but with aw In adoration at his feet I fell Submiss he reard me and Whom thou soughtst I am Said mildely Author of all this thou seest Above or round about thee or beneath  This Paradise I give thee count it thine To Till and keep and of the Fruit to eate Of every Tree that in the Garden growes Eate freely with glad heart fear here no dearth But of the Tree whose operation brings Knowledg of good and ill which I have set The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life Remember what I warne thee shun to taste And shun the bitter consequence for know The day thou eatst thereof my sole command Transgrest inevitably thou shalt dye From that day mortal and this happie State Shalt loose expelld from hence into a World Of woe and sorrow    Sternly he pronouncd The rigid interdiction which resounds Yet dreadful in mine eare though in my choice Not to incur but soon his cleer aspect Returnd and gracious purpose thus renewd  Not onely these fair bounds but all the Earth To thee and to thy Race I give as Lords Possess it and all things that therein live Or live in Sea or Aire Beast Fish and Fowle  In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold After thir kindes I bring them to receave From thee thir Names and pay thee fealtie With low subjection understand the same Of Fish within thir watry residence Not hither summond since they cannot change Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire  As thus he spake each Bird and Beast behold Approaching two and two These cowring low With blandishment each Bird stoopd on his wing  I namd them as they passd and understood Thir Nature with such knowledg God endud My sudden apprehension but in these I found not what me thought I wanted still And to the Heavnly vision thus presumd  O by what Name for thou above all these Above mankinde or aught then mankinde higher Surpassest farr my naming how may I Adore thee Author of this Universe And all this good to man for whose well being So amply and with hands so liberal Thou hast provided all things but with mee I see not who partakes    In solitude What happiness who can enjoy alone Or all enjoying what contentment find Thus I presumptuous and the vision bright As with a smile more brightnd thus replid  What callst thou solitude is not the Earth With various living creatures and the Aire Replenisht and all these at thy command To come and play before thee knowst thou not Thir language and thir wayes they also know And reason not contemptibly with these Find pastime and beare rule thy Realm is large  So spake the Universal Lord and seemd So ordering    I with leave of speech implord And humble deprecation thus replid  Let not my words offend thee Heavnly Power My Maker be propitious while I speak  Hast thou not made me here thy substitute And these inferiour farr beneath me set Among unequals what societie Can sort what harmonie or true delight Which must be mutual in proportion due Givn and receivd but in disparitie The one intense the other still remiss Cannot well suite with either but soon prove Tedious alike Of fellowship I speak Such as I seek fit to participate All rational delight wherein the brute Cannot be human consort they rejoyce Each with thir kinde Lion with Lioness So fitly them in pairs thou hast combind Much less can Bird with Beast or Fish with Fowle So well converse nor with the Ox the Ape Wors then can Man with Beast and least of all  Whereto th Almighty answerd not displeasd   A nice and suttle happiness I see Thou to thy self proposest in the choice Of thy Associates Adam and wilt taste No pleasure though in pleasure solitarie  What thinkst thou then of mee and this my State Seem I to thee sufficiently possest Of happiness or not who am alone From all Eternitie for none I know Second to me or like equal much less  How have I then with whom to hold converse Save with the Creatures which I made and those To me inferiour infinite descents Beneath what other Creatures are to thee He ceasd I lowly answerd    To attaine The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes All human thoughts come short Supream of things Thou in thy self art perfet and in thee Is no deficience found not so is Man But in degree the cause of his desire By conversation with his like to help Or solace his defects    No need that thou Shouldst propagat already infinite And through all numbers absolute though One But Man by number is to manifest His single imperfection and beget Like of his like his Image multiplid In unitie defective which requires Collateral love and deerest amitie  Thou in thy secresie although alone Best with thy self accompanied seekst not Social communication yet so pleasd Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt Of Union or Communion deifid I by conversing cannot these erect From prone nor in thir wayes complacence find  Thus I emboldnd spake and freedom usd Permissive and acceptance found which gaind This answer from the gratious voice Divine  Thus farr to try thee Adam I was pleasd And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone Which thou hast rightly namd but of thy self Expressing well the spirit within thee free My Image not imparted to the Brute Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike And be so minded still I ere thou spakst Knew it not good for Man to be alone And no such companie as then thou sawst Intended thee for trial onely brought To see how thou couldst judge of fit and meet What next I bring shall please thee be assurd Thy likeness thy fit help thy other self Thy wish exactly to thy hearts desire  Hee ended or I heard no more for now My earthly by his Heavnly overpowerd Which it had long stood under streind to the highth In that celestial Colloquie sublime As with an object that excels the sense Dazl d and spent sunk down and sought repair Of sleep which instantly fell on me calld By Nature as in aide and closd mine eyes  Mine eyes he closd but opn left the Cell Of Fancie my internal sight by which Abstract as in a transe methought I saw Though sleeping where I lay and saw the shape Still glorious before whom awake I stood Who stooping opnd my left side and took From thence a Rib with cordial spirits warme And Life-blood streaming fresh wide was the wound But suddenly with flesh filld up and heald The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands Under his forming hands a Creature grew Manlike but different Sex so lovly faire That what seemd fair in all the World seemd now Mean or in her summd up in her containd And in her looks which from that time infusd Sweetness into my heart unfelt before And into all things from her Aire inspird The spirit of love and amorous delight  Shee disappeerd and left me dark I wakd To find her or for ever to deplore Her loss and other pleasures all abjure When out of hope behold her not farr off Such as I saw her in my dream adornd With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow To make her amiable On she came Led by her Heavnly Maker though unseen And guided by his voice nor uninformd Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites Grace was in all her steps Heavn in her Eye In every gesture dignitie and love  I overjoyd could not forbear aloud  This turn hath made amends thou hast fulfilld Thy words Creator bounteous and benigne Giver of all things faire but fairest this Of all thy gifts nor enviest    I now see Bone of my Bone Flesh of my Flesh my Self Before me Woman is her Name of Man Extracted for this cause he shall forgoe Father and Mother and to his Wife adhere And they shall be one Flesh one Heart one Soule  She heard me thus and though divinely brought Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie Her vertue and the conscience of her worth That would be wood and not unsought be won Not obvious not obtrusive but retird The more desirable or to say all Nature her self though pure of sinful thought Wrought in her so that seeing me she turnd I followd her she what was Honour knew And with obsequious Majestie approvd My pleaded reason    To the Nuptial Bowre I led her blushing like the Morn all Heavn And happie Constellations on that houre Shed thir selectest influence the Earth Gave sign of gratulation and each Hill Joyous the Birds fresh Gales and gentle Aires Whisperd it to the Woods and from thir wings Flung Rose flung Odours from the spicie Shrub Disporting till the amorous Bird of Night Sung Spousal and bid haste the Eevning Starr On his Hill top to light the bridal Lamp  Thus I have told thee all my State and brought My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss Which I enjoy and must confess to find In all things else delight indeed but such As usd or not works in the mind no change Nor vehement desire these delicacies I mean of Taste Sight Smell Herbs Fruits and Flours Walks and the melodie of Birds but here Farr otherwise transported I behold Transported touch here passion first I felt Commotion strange in all enjoyments else Superiour and unmovd here onely weake Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance  Or Nature faild in mee and left some part Not proof enough such Object to sustain Or from my side subducting took perhaps More then enough at least on her bestowd Too much of Ornament in outward shew Elaborate of inward less exact  For well I understand in the prime end Of Nature her th inferiour in the mind And inward Faculties which most excell In outward also her resembling less His Image who made both and less expressing The character of that Dominion givn Ore other Creatures yet when I approach Her loveliness so absolute she seems And in her self compleat so well to know Her own that what she wills to do or say Seems wisest vertuousest discreetest best All higher knowledge in her presence falls Degraded Wisdom in discourse with her Looses discountnanct and like folly shewes Authority and Reason on her waite As one intended first not after made Occasionally and to consummate all Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat Build in her loveliest and create an awe About her as a guard Angelic plact  To whom the Angel with contracted brow  Accuse not Nature she hath don her part Do thou but thine and be not diffident Of Wisdom she deserts thee not if thou Dismiss not her when most thou needst her nigh By attributing overmuch to things Less excellent as thou thy self perceavst  For what admirst thou what transports thee so An outside fair no doubt and worthy well Thy cherishing thy honouring and thy love Not thy subjection weigh with her thy self Then value Oft times nothing profits more Then self esteem grounded on just and right Well managd of that skill the more thou knowst The more she will acknowledge thee her Head And to realities yield all her shows Made so adorn for thy delight the more So awful that with honour thou maist love Thy mate who sees when thou art seen least wise  But if the sense of touch whereby mankind Is propagated seem such dear delight Beyond all other think the same voutsaft To Cattel and each Beast which would not be To them made common and divulgd if aught Therein enjoyd were worthy to subdue The Soule of Man or passion in him move  What higher in her societie thou findst Attractive human rational love still In loving thou dost well in passion not Wherein true Love consists not love refines The thoughts and heart enlarges hath his seat In Reason and is judicious is the scale By which to heavnly Love thou maist ascend Not sunk in carnal pleasure for which cause Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found  To whom thus half abasht Adam replid  Neither her out-side formd so fair nor aught In procreation common to all kindes Though higher of the genial Bed by far And with mysterious reverence I deem So much delights me as those graceful acts Those thousand decencies that daily flow From all her words and actions mixt with Love And sweet compliance which declare unfeignd Union of Mind or in us both one Soule Harmonie to behold in wedded pair More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare  Yet these subject not I to thee disclose What inward thence I feel not therefore foild Who meet with various objects from the sense Variously representing yet still free Approve the best and follow what I approve  To love thou blamst me not for love thou saist Leads up to Heavn is both the way and guide Bear with me then if lawful what I ask Love not the heavnly Spirits and how thir Love Express they by looks onely or do they mix Irradiance virtual or immediate touch To whom the Angel with a smile that glowd Celestial rosie red Loves proper hue Answerd    Let it suffice thee that thou knowst Us happie and without Love no happiness  Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyst And pure thou wert created we enjoy In eminence and obstacle find none Of membrane joynt or limb exclusive barrs Easier then Air with Air if Spirits embrace Total they mix Union of Pure with Pure Desiring nor restraind conveyance need As Flesh to mix with Flesh or Soul with Soul  But I can now no more the parting Sun Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles Hesperean sets my Signal to depart  Be strong live happie and love but first of all Him whom to love is to obey and keep His great command take heed least Passion sway Thy judgement to do aught which else free Will Would not admit thine and of all thy Sons The weal or woe in thee is plact beware  I in thy persevering shall rejoyce And all the Blest stand fast to stand or fall Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies  Perfet within no outward aid require And all temptation to transgress repel  So saying he arose whom Adam thus Followd with benediction    Since to part Go heavenly Guest Ethereal Messenger Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore  Gentle to me and affable hath been Thy condescension and shall be honourd ever With grateful Memorie thou to mankind Be good and friendly still and oft return  So parted they the Angel up to Heavn From the thick shade and Adam to his Bowre
