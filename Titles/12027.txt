A paneled dining room in Holder Hall  Stage right enter twit“Mr  Ashbery I’m your biggest campus fan ” We hit it offAnd talked about “The Skaters” and my preference for “Clepsydra” Vs  “Fragment ” Later on that night John asked me to a party in New York And Saturday after dinner and a panel on the artist’s role as something And a party driving Lewis’s Austin-Healey through the rain I sealed our friendship with an accident  The party was on BroadwayAn apartment white of course with paintings just downstairsFrom Frank O’Hara’s who finally wandered down  I talked to himA little about Love Poems Tentative Title which pleased himAnd quoted a line from “Poem” about the rain which seemed to please him too The party ended John and I went off to Max’s ordered steaks And talked about our mothers  All that talking poems and paintingsParents all those parties and the age of manifestos still to comeI started coming to New York for lunch  We’d meet at Art NewsWalk to Fifty-sixth Street to Larre’s a restaurant filled with French expatriatesHave martinis and the prix fixe for 2 50  drink rose de ProvenceAnd talk of course about Genet and James and words like “Coca-Cola ”It was an afternoon in May when John brought up a playThat he and Kenneth Koch and Frank O’Hara Holy TrinityBatman was in vogue had started years ago and never finished There was a dictator named Edgar and some penicillinBut that’s all I remember  They hadn’t actually been togetherIn years but planned to finish it that night at John’s new apartmentOn Ninety-fifth Street and he said to come by for a drinkBefore they ate and got to work  It was a New York dreamCome true a brownstone floor-through white and full of paintingsNaturally “with a good library and record collection ”John had procured a huge steak and as I helped him set the tableThe doorbell rang and Frank O’Hara fresh from the museumAnd svelte in a hound’s tooth sports coat entered followed shortlyBy “excitement-prone Kenneth Koch” in somber grayAnd I was one with my immortals  In the small mythologiesWe make up out of memories and the flow of timeA few moments remain frozen though the feel of them is lostThe feel of talk  It ranged from puns to gossip always coming back To poems and poets  Frank was fiercely loyal to young poetsJoe Ceravolo’s name came up I think and when I mentioned LewisIn a way that must have sounded catty he leapt to his defenseLeaving me to backtrack in embarrassment and have another drinkWhich is what everyone had  I think you see where it was goingConversation drifting into dinner then I stayed for dinnerAnd everyone forgot about the play which was never finishedThough I think I’ve seen a fragment of it somewhere  I see a tableIn a cone of light but there’s no sound except for Kenneth’s Deadpan “Love to see a boy eat” as I speared a piece of steakAnd then the only voice I’m sure I hear is mineAs those moments that had once seemed singular and clearDissolve into a “general mess of imprecision of feeling”And images augmented by line breaks  There were phone callsOther people arrived the narrative of the night dissolvedAnd finally everyone went home  School and spring wound down The semester ended then the weekend that I wrote about in “Sally’s Hair”Arrived and went and then a late-night cruise around Manhattan for a rich friend’sParents’ anniversary bash followed by an Upper East Side preppie barThat left me looking for a place to crash and so I rang John’s bell at 2 AMAnd failed thank God to rouse him caught a plane to San DiegoThe next day worked at my summer job and worked on poemsAnd started reading Proust and got a card one afternoonFrom Peter Schjeldahl telling me that Frank O’Hara had been killed Ninety-fifth Street soldiered on for several years I remember a cocktail party the symposium of those daysFollowed by dinner just around the corner at Elaine’sPre-Woody Allen  It was there I learned of R F K ’s assassinationWhen I woke up on the daybed in the living room and whereJohn told me getting married would ruin me as a poetI don’t know why most of his friends were married a judgmentHe revised when he met Susan and inscribed The Double Dream of Spring“If this is all we need fear from spinach then I don’t mind so much”Which was probably premature watering his plants one dayShe soaked his landlord Giorgio Cavallon dozing in the garden below It was where Peter Delacorte late one night recited an entire sideOf a Firesign Theatre album from memory and set John on that pathTo his friends’ subsequent dismay and where he blessed me with his extra copyOf The Poems and next day had second thoughts though I kept it anyway  Sometimes a vague amorphous stretch of years assumes a shapeAnd then becomes an age and then a golden age alive with possibilitiesWhen change was in the air and you could wander through its streetsAs though through Florence and the Renaissance  I know it sounds ridiculousBut that’s the way life flows in stages that take form in retrospectWhen all the momentary things that occupy the mind from day to dayHave vanished into time and something takes their place that wasn’t thereA sense of freedom one which gradually slipped away  The centerOf the conversation moved downtown the Renaissance gave way to mannerismAs the junior faculty took charge leaving the emeriti alone and out of itOf course lying on the fringes happily awake but for the rest The laws proscribing what you couldn’t do were clear  I got so tiredOf writing all those New York poems though by then I’d moved to Boston To Siena you might say that led to nowhere but the next oneSo I started writing poems about whatever moved me what it’s likeTo be alive within a world that holds no place for you yet seems so beautifulThe feeling of the future and its disappointments the trajectory of a lifeThat always brought me back to time and memory I’d finished Proust by thenAnd brings me back to this  John finally moved downtown himselfInto a two-story apartment at Twenty-fifth and Tenth with a spiral staircase Leading to a library the locus of the incident of Susan Alydar and John And the pitcher of water I’ll draw a veil over it and Jimmy Schuyler sighing“It’s so beautiful” as Bernadette Peters sang “Raining in My Heart” from Dames at Sea The poetry still continued mine and everyone’s  I’d added Jimmy To my pantheon as you’ve probably noticed but the night in nineteen sixty-six Seemed more and more remote I never saw Kenneth anymoreAnd there were new epicenters with new casts of characters like Madoo Bob Dash’s garden in Sagaponack and Bill and Willy’s loft in Soho John moved again to Twenty-second Street and Susan and I moved to MilwaukeeWhere our son was born  I stopped coming to New York and writing poems For several years while I tried to dream enough philosophy for tenure One afternoon in May I found myself at Ninth and Twenty-secondAnd as though on cue two people whom I hadn’t seen in years David Kalstone Darragh Park just happened by and then I took a taxi down to SohoTo the loft and then a gallery to hear Joe Brainard read from I RememberBack to John’s and out to dinner as though I’d never been away Though it was all too clear I had  Poems were in the air but theory too And members of the thought police department who must have also gotten tenure Turned up everywhere with arguments that poetry was called upon to prove It mattered but in a different way as though it floated free from poemsAnd wasn’t quite the point  I kept on coming back as I still do Half my life was still to come and yet the rest was mostly personalI got divorced and Willy killed himself and here I am now ready to retire There was an obituary in the Times last week for Michael GoldbergA painter you’ll recall from Frank O’Hara’s poems “Why I Am Not a Painter”“Ode to Michael Goldberg ’s Birth and Other Births”  I didn’t know himBut a few months after the soiree on Ninety-fifth Street I was at a partyIn his studio on the Bowery which was still his studio when he died The New York art world demimonde was there including nearly everyoneWho’s turned up in this poem  I remember staring at a guy whoLooked like something from the Black Lagoon dancing with a gorgeousWoman half his age  That’s my New York an island dreamOf personalities and evenings nights where poetry was second natureAnd their lives flowed through it and around it as it gave them life O brave new world now old that had such people in’t
          
“The tiresome old man is telling us his life story ” I guess I am but that’s what poets do not always Quite as obviously as this and usually more by indirectionAnd omission but beneath the poetry lies the singular reality And unreality of an individual life  I see it as a longIlluminated tunnel lined with windows giving on the scenes outside On Ninety-fifth Street forty years ago  As life goes onYou start to get increasingly distracted by your own reflectionAnd the darkness gradually becoming visible at the end  I try not to look too far ahead but just to stay here  Quick now here now always only something pulls meBack as they say to the day when poems were more like secretsWith their own vernacular and you could tell your friends By who and what they read  And now John’s practically become A national treasure and whenever I look up I think I see him Floating in the sky like the Cheshire Cat  I don’t knowWhat to make of it but it makes me happy like seeing Kenneth Just before he died “I’m going west John I’m going west” In his apartment on a side street near Columbia or rememberingOnce again that warm spring night in nineteen sixty-six  I like to think of them together once again at the cocktail partyAt the end of the mind where I could blunder in and ruin it one last time Meanwhile on a hillside in the driftless region to the westA few miles from the small town where The Straight Story endsI’m building a house on a meadow if I’m permitted to returnBehind a screen of trees above a lower meadow with some apple treesIn which the fog collects on autumn afternoons and a vistaOf an upland pasture without heaviness  I see myselfSitting on the deck and sipping a martini as I used to at Larre’s In a future that feels almost like a past I’m positive is there  But where I think my life is still all conversationOnly now it’s with myself  I can see it continuing foreverEven in my absence as I close the windows and turn off the lightsAnd it begins to rain  And then we’re there together In the house on the meadow waiting for whatever’s left to comeIn what’s become the near future two versions of myself And of the people that we knew each one an otherTo the other yet both indelibly there the twit of twentyAnd the aging child of sixty-two still separateAnd searching in the night listening through the nightTo the noise of the rain and memories of rainAnd evenings when we’d wander out into the RenaissanceWhen I could see you and talk to you and it could still changeAnd still there in the morning when the rain has stoppedAnd the apples are all getting tinted in the cool light
