
A clamor in the distance  A crowd running under the rain beatingdown between the canvases the sea wind set clattering A man passes crying something  What is he saying What heknows What he has seen I make out his words  Ah I almostunderstandI took refuge in a museum  Outside the great wind mixed withwater reigns alone from now on shaking the glass panes In each painting I think it’s as if  God were giving up on finishingthe world   Translated from the French
