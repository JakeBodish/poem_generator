
After the war perhaps Ill sit againOut on the terrace where I sat with youAnd see the changeless sky and hills beat blueAnd live an afternoon of summer through I shall remember then and sad at heartFor the lost day of happiness we knewWish only that some other man were youAnd spoke my name as once you used to do
