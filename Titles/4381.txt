
The aftermath always happening like an airplane falling or a man
midair falling from a horse and an arrow a gun many guns
pointing away at us our all bull’s-eye-on-the-mark  This is what he
sees when he sees  Maybe Wrong or not the appropriation the film
clip chase pressed lips over lips photo moment on the minute-drawn
breath in the over the under bodies in black and white cut to pose
the way a kiss can pose dispose of everything around it for another
dispose of thinking  It’s like waving good-bye  Mouth to mouth seeing
as saying  Inside  Resuscitation back to the brain saying yes as the mouth
makes an O  Circles for the digital age colored dots for faces already
made for erasing  Hurry come he 6’7” sees fifteen minutes from the
Mexican border cremates his old paintings up close  But the ashes were
kept in a book urn not so afloat in the ocean with my parents Above
On and Under with Mermaid
