in the most remarkable ways

It would be winter with a thin snow  An aged sunbeam
would fall on me then on a nearby summit until a mass
of ice would come upon me like a crown of master diamonds
in shades of gold and pink  The base of the mountains
would be still in darkness  The snow would melt
making the mountain uglier  The ice would undertake
a journey toward dying  My iliacus from which orchids bloom
would learn to take an infant’s shape some premature creature
weaned too soon  My femoral nerve from which lichen grows
in many shades would learn to take breaths of its own
and would issue a moan so labored it could have issued
from two women carrying a full-length wooden casket with dirt
made from a girl inside  The dirt would have been buried
with all of the girl’s celestial possessions  Bearing the casket
would demand more muscles than earthbound horses have 
The girl would have been twenty-four  This was my visio 
Sometimes I think of it as prophecy  Other times history 
For years it was akin to some specific land with a vessel
that would come for me able to cross land sea the spaces
of the universe able to burrow deep into the ground 
Anything could summon it   a breaking in cloud cover
wind chimes catching salt outside my mother’s window
a corner of a painting  And I learned how to call it too 
This is the only skill of which I have ever been proud 
When my sister died from the head of my visio came offspring
in the thousands armed to the teeth each its own vessel 
My first their mother lived on  For itself and its hoard
it found a permanent home in a cave at the bottom of a lake 
And it waited until I was standing on a mountain to sing to meYou will call this mountain home until I tell you to move again 
There will always be more of it underground than you
