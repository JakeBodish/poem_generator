gaudy shapes possess As thick and numberless       As the gay motes that people the sunbeams Or likest hovering dreams       The fickle pensioners of Morpheus train  But hail thou goddess sage and holy Hail divinest Melancholy Whose saintly visage is too bright To hit the sense of human sight And therefore to our weaker view Oer-laid with black staid Wisdoms hue Black but such as in esteem Prince Memnons sister might beseem Or that starrd Ethiop queen that strove To set her beautys praise above The sea nymphs and their powers offended  Yet thou art higher far descended Thee bright-haird Vesta long of yore To solitary Saturn bore His daughter she in Saturns reign Such mixture was not held a stain Oft in glimmering bowrs and glades He met her and in secret shades Of woody Idas inmost grove While yet there was no fear of Jove  Come pensive nun devout and pure Sober stedfast and demure All in a robe of darkest grain Flowing with majestic train And sable stole of cypress lawn Over thy decent shoulders drawn  Come but keep thy wonted state With evn step and musing gait And looks commercing with the skies Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes There held in holy passion still Forget thyself to marble till With a sad leaden downward cast Thou fix them on the earth as fast  And join with thee calm Peace and Quiet Spare Fast that oft with gods doth diet And hears the Muses in a ring Aye round about Joves altar sing  And add to these retired Leisure That in trim gardens takes his pleasure But first and chiefest with thee bring Him that yon soars on golden wing Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne The cherub Contemplation And the mute Silence hist along Less Philomel will deign a song In her sweetest saddest plight Smoothing the rugged brow of night While Cynthia checks her dragon yoke Gently oer th accustomd oak  Sweet bird that shunnst the noise of folly Most musical most melancholy Thee chauntress oft the woods among I woo to hear thy even-song And missing thee I walk unseen On the dry smooth-shaven green To behold the wandring Moon Riding near her highest noon Like one that had been led astray Through the heavns wide pathless way And oft as if her head she bowd Stooping through a fleecy cloud  Oft on a plat of rising ground I hear the far-off curfew sound Over some wide-waterd shore Swinging slow with sullen roar Or if the air will not permit Some still removed place will fit Where glowing embers through the room Teach light to counterfeit a gloom Far from all resort of mirth Save the cricket on the hearth Or the bellmans drowsy charm To bless the doors from nightly harm  Or let my lamp at midnight hour Be seen in some high lonely towr Where I may oft out-watch the Bear With thrice great Hermes or unsphere The spirit of Plato to unfold What worlds or what vast regions hold The immortal mind that hath forsook Her mansion in this fleshly nook And of those dæmons that are found In fire air flood or under ground Whose power hath a true consent With planet or with element  Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy In sceptrd pall come sweeping by Presenting Thebes or Pelops line Or the tale of Troy divine Or what though rare of later age Ennobled hath the buskind stage  But O sad Virgin that thy power Might raise Musæus from his bower Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing Such notes as warbled to the string Drew iron tears down Plutos cheek And made Hell grant what love did seek  Or call up him that left half told The story of Cambuscan bold Of Camball and of Algarsife And who had Canace to wife That ownd the virtuous ring and glass And of the wondrous horse of brass On which the Tartar king did ride And if aught else great bards beside In sage and solemn tunes have sung Of tourneys and of trophies hung Of forests and enchantments drear Where more is meant than meets the ear  Thus Night oft see me in thy pale career Till civil-suited Morn appear Not trickd and frouncd as she was wont With the Attic boy to hunt But kerchiefd in a comely cloud While rocking winds are piping loud Or usherd with a shower still When the gust hath blown his fill Ending on the rustling leaves With minute-drops from off the eaves  And when the Sun begins to fling His flaring beams me goddess bring To arched walks of twilight groves And shadows brown that Sylvan loves Of pine or monumental oak Where the rude axe with heaved stroke Was never heard the nymphs to daunt Or fright them from their hallowd haunt  There in close covert by some brook Where no profaner eye may look Hide me from Days garish eye While the bee with honied thigh That at her flowry work doth sing And the waters murmuring With such consort as they keep Entice the dewy-featherd sleep And let some strange mysterious dream Wave at his wings in airy stream Of lively portraiture displayd Softly on my eye-lids laid  And as I wake sweet music breathe Above about or underneath Sent by some spirit to mortals good Or th unseen Genius of the wood           But let my due feet never fail To walk the studious cloisters pale And love the high embowed roof With antique pillars massy proof And storied windows richly dight Casting a dim religious light  There let the pealing organ blow To the full-voicd quire below In service high and anthems clear As may with sweetness through mine ear Dissolve me into ecstasies And bring all Heavn before mine eyes  And may at last my weary age Find out the peaceful hermitage The hairy gown and mossy cell Where I may sit and rightly spell Of every star that Heavn doth shew And every herb that sips the dew Till old experience do attain To something like prophetic strain  These pleasures Melancholy give And I with thee will choose to live
