
Most truly honoured and as truly dearIf worth in me or ought I do appearWho can of right better demand the sameThan may your worthy self from whom it cameThe principal might yield a greater sumYet handled ill amounts but to this crumbMy stocks so small I know not how to payMy bond remains in force unto this dayYet for part payment take this simple miteWhere nothings to be had kings loose their right Such is my debt I may not say forgiveBut as I can Ill pay it while I liveSuch is my bond none can discharge but IYet paying is not paid until I die
