
I 
The spider expects the cold of winter 
When the shadows fall in long Autumn
He congeals in a nest of paper prepares
The least and minimal existence
Obedient to nature  No other course
Is his no other availed him when
In high summer he spun and furled
The gaudy catches  I am that spider
Caught in nature summer and winter 
You are the symbol of the seasons too 
 
II 
Now to expatiate and temporize
This artful brag  I never saw so quieting
A sight as the dawn dew-clenched foot-
Wide web hung on summer barn-eaves spangled 
It moves to zephyrs that is tough as steel 
I never saw so finely-legged a creature
Walk so accurate a stretch as he
Proud capable patient confident 
To the eye he gave close penetration
Into real myth the myth of you of me 
 
III 
Yet by moving eyesight off from this
There is another dimension  Near the barn
Down meadow to shingle no place for spiders
The sea in large blue breathes in brainstorm tides
Pirates itself away to ancient Spain
Pirouettes past Purgatory to Paradise 
Do I feed deeper on a spider
A close-hauled view upon windless meaning
Or deeper a day or dance or doom bestride
On ocean’s long reach on parables of God
