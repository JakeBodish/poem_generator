
It wasn’t the bright hems of the Lord’s skirts
that brushed my face and I opened my eyes
to see from a cleft in rock His backside
it’s a wasp perched on my left cheek  I keep
my eyes closed and stand perfectly still
in the garden till it leaves me alone
not to contemplate how this century
ends and the next begins with no one
I know having seen God but to wonder
why I get through most days unscathed though I
live in a time when it might be otherwise
and I grow more fatherless each day 
For years now I have come to conclusions
without my father’s help discovering
on my own what I know what I don’t know
and seeing how one cancels the other 
Ive become a scholar of cancellations 
Here I stand among my father’s roses
and see that what punctures outnumbers what
consoles the cruel and the tender never
make peace though one climbs though one descends
petal by petal to the hidden ground
no one owns  I see that which is taken
away by violence or persuasion 
The rose announces on earth the kingdom
of gravity  A bird cancels it 
My eyelids cancel the bird  Anything
might cancel my eyes distance time war 
My father said Never take your both eyes
off of the world
