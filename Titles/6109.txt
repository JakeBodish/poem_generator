
This song is not a language
Not a thing to be remembered
The field-holler tradition of
Teeth and knees
Cursing wind
A concert hall of   bloody hands
Spilling the earth
Strangling dirt
Sledgehammer curses
Of  men busted open 
On Parchman Farm
You could hear it coming
Up through the trees
The hammering pulpit of
Crooning men and sweat
The tender meat of palms
Pulped like plums 
Them men gulped down the
Dawn dew air
Let it catch in their throats
Broke the sunrise up and
Sang hymns like hexesBe my woman gal I’ll beeee your maaaaaaan           
And the killing fields of  Mississippi
Fizzled down to juke joints and
The hothouse music of illegal clubs
With thick women they loved outright and
Played cards with and
Gave bourbon to when their hands
Didn’t hold sorrow like
Pickaxes and the railroad was
Just a railroad
A way to ride north if  you could
Get your money right 
Redbone gals with rosewater sweat
When they lifted their knees
Sunflower County was a heaven
They believed in Stick to the promise gal that you maaaaaade meeeeee           
Steady now
They turned back the clock on
Their hard hard hands
Let the memory of fresh linen and
Ladies’ slips like gossamer
Wings a parade of  plump thighs
The juju thrust of  furious bones
Spread like grease
Across starched-white sheets
Midwife them out of ol’ Parchman Farm
And back to the cockfights and gambling
Back when they had ambition
Back when they had a sweet woman
To hold her fat wrists
Soft as butter
Limp as rain When she walk she reel and rock beeeeeehind
Ain’t that enough to make a convict smiiiiiiiiile
