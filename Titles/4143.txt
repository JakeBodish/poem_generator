
Beneath the waver of the dorsal fin lie the blood-shades
of lamellae their skin so close to the vein they breathe
filter gather flex set down in loose and frangible parallels
you find in gills of mushrooms clams and concertinas 
Wave after wave the tissues of the water breathers
conceal what they reveal according to their vital rhythm 
Fins that breathe flit this way that in the give-and-take
of panic and lust and tropical surge from no one place 
To every fish flesh nightmare and song a private opening
and the name it bears  Let us call it tomorrow or lament
the heart of my volition
