sweet new Speech resumes  Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end And Man as from a second stock proceed  Much thou hast yet to see but I perceave Thy mortal sight to faile objects divine Must needs impaire and wearie human sense Henceforth what is to com I will relate Thou therefore give due audience and attend  This second sours of Men while yet but few And while the dread of judgement past remains Fresh in thir mindes fearing the Deitie With some regard to what is just and right Shall lead thir lives and multiplie apace Labouring the soile and reaping plenteous crop Corn wine and oyle and from the herd or flock Oft sacrificing Bullock Lamb or Kid With large Wine-offerings pourd and sacred Feast Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblamd and dwell Long time in peace by Families and Tribes Under paternal rule till one shall rise Of proud ambitious heart who not content With fair equalitie fraternal state Will arrogate Dominion undeservd Over his brethren and quite dispossess Concord and law of Nature from the Earth Hunting and Men not Beasts shall be his game With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse Subjection to his Empire tyrannous A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styld Before the Lord as in despite of Heavn Or from Heavn claming second Sovrantie And from Rebellion shall derive his name Though of Rebellion others he accuse  Hee with a crew whom like Ambition joyns With him or under him to tyrannize Marching from Eden towards the West shall finde The Plain wherein a black bituminous gurge Boiles out from under ground the mouth of Hell Of Brick and of that stuff they cast to build A Citie and Towre whose top may reach to Heavn And get themselves a name least far disperst In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost Regardless whether good or evil fame  But God who oft descends to visit men Unseen and through thir habitations walks To mark thir doings them beholding soon Comes down to see thir Citie ere the Tower Obstruct Heavn Towrs and in derision sets Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase Quite out thir Native Language and instead To sow a jangling noise of words unknown Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud Among the Builders each to other calls Not understood till hoarse and all in rage As mockt they storm great laughter was in Heavn And looking down to see the hubbub strange And hear the din thus was the building left Ridiculous and the work Confusion namd  Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeasd  O execrable Son so to aspire Above his Brethren to himself assuming Authoritie usurpt from God not givn He gave us onely over Beast Fish Fowl Dominion absolute that right we hold By his donation but Man over men He made not Lord such title to himself Reserving human left from human free  But this Usurper his encroachment proud Stayes not on Man to God his Tower intends Siege and defiance Wretched man what food Will he convey up thither to sustain Himself and his rash Armie where thin Aire Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross And famish him of Breath if not of Bread To whom thus Michael  Justly thou abhorrst That Son who on the quiet state of men Such trouble brought affecting to subdue Rational Libertie yet know withall Since thy original lapse true Libertie Is lost which alwayes with right Reason dwells Twinnd and from her hath no dividual being Reason in man obscurd or not obeyd Immediately inordinate desires And upstart Passions catch the Government From Reason and to servitude reduce Man till then free  Therefore since hee permits Within himself unworthie Powers to reign Over free Reason God in judgement just Subjects him from without to violent Lords Who oft as undeservedly enthrall His outward freedom Tyrannie must be Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse  Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low From vertue which is reason that no wrong But Justice and some fatal curse annext Deprives them of thir outward libertie Thir inward lost Witness th irreverent Son Of him who built the Ark who for the shame Don to his Father heard this heavie curse Servant of Seruants on his vitious Race  Thus will this latter as the former World Still tend from bad to worse till God at last Wearied with their iniquities withdraw His presence from among them and avert His holy Eyes resolving from thenceforth To leave them to thir own polluted wayes And one peculiar Nation to select From all the rest of whom to be invokd A Nation from one faithful man to spring Him on this side Euphrates yet residing Bred up in Idol-worship O that men Canst thou believe should be so stupid grown While yet the Patriark livd who scapd the Flood As to forsake the living God and fall To worship thir own work in Wood and Stone For Gods yet him God the most High voutsafes To call by Vision from his Fathers house His kindred and false Gods into a Land Which he will shew him and from him will raise A mightie Nation and upon him showre His benediction so that in his Seed All Nations shall be blest he straight obeys Not knowing to what Land yet firm believes I see him but thou canst not with what Faith He leaves his Gods his Friends and native Soile Ur of Chaldaea passing now the Ford To Haran after him a cumbrous Train Of Herds and Flocks and numerous servitude Not wandring poor but trusting all his wealth With God who calld him in a land unknown  Canaan he now attains I see his Tents Pitcht about Sechem and the neighbouring Plaine Of Moreh there by promise he receaves Gift to his Progenie of all that Land From Hamath Northward to the Desert South Things by thir names I call though yet unnamd From Hermon East to the great Western Sea Mount Hermon yonder Sea each place behold In prospect as I point them on the shoare Mount Carmel here the double-founted stream Jordan true limit Eastward but his Sons Shall dwell to Senir that long ridge of Hills  This ponder that all Nations of the Earth Shall in his Seed be blessed by that Seed Is meant thy great deliverer who shall bruise The Serpents head whereof to thee anon Plainlier shall be reveald  This Patriarch blest Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call A Son and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves Like him in faith in wisdom and renown The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast departs From Canaan to a Land hereafter calld Egypt divided by the River Nile See where it flows disgorging at seaven mouthes Into the Sea to sojourn in that Land He comes invited by a yonger Son In time of dearth a Son whose worthy deeds Raise him to be the second in that Realme Of Pharao there he dies and leaves his Race Growing into a Nation and now grown Suspected to a sequent King who seeks To stop thir overgrowth as inmate guests Too numerous whence of guests he makes them slaves Inhospitably and kills thir infant Males Till by two brethren those two brethren call Moses and Aaron sent from God to claime His people from enthralment they return With glory and spoile back to thir promisd Land  But first the lawless Tyrant who denies To know thir God or message to regard Must be compelld by Signes and judgements dire To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd Frogs Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill With loathd intrusion and fill all the land His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss And all his people Thunder mixt with Haile Haile mixt with fire must rend th Egyptian Skie And wheel on th Earth devouring where it rouls What it devours not Herb or Fruit or Graine A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down Must eat and on the ground leave nothing green Darkness must overshadow all his bounds Palpable darkness and blot out three dayes Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born Of Egypt must lie dead  Thus with ten wounds The River-dragon tamd at length submits To let his sojourners depart and oft Humbles his stubborn heart but still as Ice More hardnd after thaw till in his rage Pursuing whom he late dismissd the Sea Swallows him with his Host but them lets pass As on drie land between two christal walls Awd by the rod of Moses so to stand Divided till his rescud gain thir shoar Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend Though present in his Angel who shall goe Before them in a Cloud and Pillar of Fire By day a Cloud by night a Pillar of Fire To guide them in thir journey and remove Behinde them while th obdurat King pursues All night he will pursue but his approach Darkness defends between till morning Watch Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud God looking forth will trouble all his Host And craze thir Chariot wheels when by command Moses once more his potent Rod extends Over the Sea the Sea his Rod obeys On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return And overwhelm thir Warr the Race elect Safe towards Canaan from the shoar advance Through the wilde Desert not the readiest way Least entring on the Canaanite allarmd Warr terrifie them inexpert and feare Return them back to Egypt choosing rather Inglorious life with servitude for life To noble and ignoble is more sweet Untraind in Armes where rashness leads not on  This also shall they gain by thir delay In the wide Wilderness there they shall found Thir government and thir great Senate choose Through the twelve Tribes to rule by Laws ordaind God from the Mount of Sinai whose gray top Shall tremble he descending will himself In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound Ordaine them Lawes part such as appertaine To civil Justice part religious Rites Of sacrifice informing them by types And shadows of that destind Seed to bruise The Serpent by what means he shall achieve Mankinds deliverance  But the voice of God To mortal eare is dreadful they beseech That Moses might report to them his will And terror cease he grants what they besaught Instructed that to God is no access Without Mediator whose high Office now Moses in figure beares to introduce One greater of whose day he shall foretell And all the Prophets in thir Age the times Of great Messiah shall sing  Thus Laws and Rites Establisht such delight hath God in Men Obedient to his will that he voutsafes Among them to set up his Tabernacle The holy One with mortal Men to dwell By his prescript a Sanctuary is framd Of Cedar overlaid with Gold therein An Ark and in the Ark his Testimony The Records of his Covnant over these A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings Of two bright Cherubim before him burn Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing The Heavnly fires over the Tent a Cloud Shall rest by Day a fiery gleame by Night Save when they journie and at length they come Conducted by his Angel to the Land Promisd to Abraham and his Seed the rest Were long to tell how many Battels fought How many Kings destroyd and Kingdoms won Or how the Sun shall in mid Heavn stand still A day entire and Nights due course adjourne Mans voice commanding Sun in Gibeon stand And thou Moon in the vale of Aialon Till Israel overcome so call the third From Abraham Son of Isaac and from him His whole descent who thus shall Canaan win  Here Adam interposd  O sent from Heavn Enlightner of my darkness gracious things Thou hast reveald those chiefly which concerne Just Abraham and his Seed now first I finde Mine eyes true opning and my heart much easd Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom Of mee and all Mankind but now I see His day in whom all Nations shall be blest Favour unmerited by me who sought Forbiddn knowledge by forbiddn means  This yet I apprehend not why to those Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth So many and so various Laws are givn So many Laws argue so many sins Among them how can God with such reside To whom thus Michael  Doubt not but that sin Will reign among them as of thee begot And therefore was Law given them to evince Thir natural pravitie by stirring up Sin against Law to fight that when they see Law can discover sin but not remove Save by those shadowie expiations weak The bloud of Bulls and Goats they may conclude Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man Just for unjust that in such righteousness To them by Faith imputed they may finde Justification towards God and peace Of Conscience which the Law by Ceremonies Cannot appease nor Man the moral part Perform and not performing cannot live  So law appears imperfet and but givn With purpose to resign them in full time Up to a better Covnant disciplind From shadowie Types to Truth from Flesh to Spirit From imposition of strict Laws to free Acceptance of large Grace from servil fear To filial works of Law to works of Faith  And therefore shall not Moses though of God Highly belovd being but the Minister Of Law his people into Canaan lead But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call His Name and Office bearing who shall quell The adversarie Serpent and bring back Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man Safe to eternal Paradise of rest  Meanwhile they in thir earthly Canaan plact Long time shall dwell and prosper but when sins National interrupt thir public peace Provoking God to raise them enemies From whom as oft he saves them penitent By Judges first then under Kings of whom The second both for pietie renownd And puissant deeds a promise shall receive Irrevocable that his Regal Throne For ever shall endure the like shall sing All Prophecie That of the Royal Stock Of David so I name this King shall rise A Son the Womans Seed to thee foretold Foretold to Abraham as in whom shall trust All Nations and to Kings foretold of Kings The last for of his Reign shall be no end  But first a long succession must ensue And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom famd The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents Wandring shall in a glorious Temple enshrine  Such follow him as shall be registerd Part good part bad of bad the longer scrowle Whose foul Idolatries and other faults Heapt to the popular summe will so incense God as to leave them and expose thir Land Thir Citie his Temple and his holy Ark With all his sacred things a scorn and prey To that proud Citie whose high Walls thou sawst Left in confusion Babylon thence calld  There in captivitie he lets them dwell The space of seventie years then brings them back Remembring mercie and his Covnant sworn To David stablisht as the dayes of Heavn  Returnd from Babylon by leave of Kings Thir Lords whom God disposd the house of God They first re-edifie and for a while In mean estate live moderate till grown In wealth and multitude factious they grow But first among the Priests dissension springs Men who attend the Altar and should most Endeavour Peace thir strife pollution brings Upon the Temple it self at last they seise The Scepter and regard not Davids Sons Then loose it to a stranger that the true Anointed King Messiah might be born Barrd of his right yet at his Birth a Starr Unseen before in Heavn proclaims him com And guides the Eastern Sages who enquire His place to offer Incense Myrrh and Gold His place of birth a solemn Angel tells To simple Shepherds keeping watch by night They gladly thither haste and by a Quire Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung  A Virgin is his Mother but his Sire The Power of the most High he shall ascend The Throne hereditarie and bound his Reign With earths wide bounds his glory with the Heavns  He ceasd discerning Adam with such joy Surchargd as had like grief bin dewd in tears Without the vent of words which these he breathd  O Prophet of glad tidings finisher Of utmost hope now clear I understand What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain Why our great expectation should be calld The seed of Woman Virgin Mother Haile High in the love of Heavn yet from my Loynes Thou shalt proceed and from thy Womb the Son Of God most High So God with man unites  Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise Expect with mortal paine say where and when Thir fight what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel  To whom thus Michael  Dream not of thir fight As of a Duel or the local wounds Of head or heel not therefore joynes the Son Manhood to God-head with more strength to foil Thy enemie nor so is overcome Satan whose fall from Heavn a deadlier bruise Disabld not to give thee thy deaths wound Which hee who comes thy Saviour shall recure Not by destroying Satan but his works In thee and in thy Seed nor can this be But by fulfilling that which thou didst want Obedience to the Law of God imposd On penaltie of death and suffering death The penaltie to thy transgression due And due to theirs which out of thine will grow So onely can high Justice rest appaid  The Law of God exact he shall fulfill Both by obedience and by love though love Alone fulfill the Law thy punishment He shall endure by coming in the Flesh To a reproachful life and cursed death Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe In his redemption and that his obedience Imputed becomes theirs by Faith his merits To save them not thir own though legal works  For this he shall live hated be blasphemd Seisd on by force judgd and to death condemnd A shameful and accurst naild to the Cross By his own Nation slaine for bringing Life But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies The Law that is against thee and the sins Of all mankinde with him there crucifid Never to hurt them more who rightly trust In this his satisfaction so he dies But soon revives Death over him no power Shall long usurp ere the third dawning light Returne the Starres of Morn shall see him rise Out of his grave fresh as the dawning light Thy ransom paid which Man from death redeems His death for Man as many as offerd Life Neglect not and the benefit imbrace By Faith not void of workes this God-like act Annuls thy doom the death thou shouldst have dyd In sin for ever lost from life this act Shall bruise the head of Satan crush his strength Defeating Sin and Death his two maine armes And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel Or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep A gentle wafting to immortal Life  Nor after resurrection shall he stay Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer To his Disciples Men who in his Life Still followd him to them shall leave in charge To teach all nations what of him they learnd And his Salvation them who shall beleeve Baptizing in the profluent stream the signe Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life Pure and in mind prepard if so befall For death like that which the redeemer dyd  All Nations they shall teach for from that day Not onely to the Sons of Abrahams Loines Salvation shall be Preacht but to the Sons Of Abrahams Faith wherever through the world So in his seed all Nations shall be blest  Then to the Heavn of Heavns he shall ascend With victory triumphing through the aire Over his foes and thine there shall surprise The Serpent Prince of aire and drag in Chaines Through all his Realme and there confounded leave Then enter into glory and resume His Seat at Gods right hand exalted high Above all names in Heavn and thence shall come When this worlds disolution shall be ripe With glory and power to judge both quick and dead To judge th unfaithful dead but to reward His faithful and receave them into bliss Whether in Heavn or Earth for then the Earth Shall all be Paradise far happier place Then this of Eden and far happier daies  So spake th Archangel Michael then pausd As at the Worlds great period and our Sire Replete with joy and wonder thus replid  O goodness infinite goodness immense That all this good of evil shall produce And evil turn to good more wonderful Then that which by creation first brought forth Light out of darkness full of doubt I stand Whether I should repent me now of sin By mee done and occasiond or rejoyce Much more that much more good thereof shall spring To God more glory more good will to Men From God and over wrauth grace shall abound  But say if our deliverer up to Heavn Must reascend what will betide the few His faithful left among th unfaithful herd The enemies of truth who then shall guide His people who defend will they not deale Wors with his followers then with him they dealt Be sure they will said th Angel but from Heavn Hee to his own a Comforter will send The promise of the Father who shall dwell His Spirit within them and the Law of Faith Working through love upon thir hearts shall write To guide them in all truth and also arme With spiritual Armour able to resist Satans assaults and quench his fierie darts What man can do against them not affraid Though to the death against such cruelties With inward consolations recompenct And oft supported so as shall amaze Thir proudest persecuters for the Spirit Powrd first on his Apostles whom he sends To evangelize the Nations then on all Baptizd shall them with wondrous gifts endue To speak all Tongues and do all Miracles As did thir Lord before them  Thus they win Great numbers of each Nation to receave With joy the tidings brought from Heavn at length Thir Ministry performd and race well run Thir doctrine and thir story written left They die but in thir room as they forewarne Wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous Wolves Who all the sacred mysteries of Heavn To thir own vile advantages shall turne Of lucre and ambition and the truth With superstitions and traditions taint Left onely in those written Records pure Though not but by the Spirit understood  Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names Places and titles and with these to joine Secular power though feigning still to act By spiritual to themselves appropriating The Spirit of God promisd alike and givn To all Beleevers and from that pretense Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force On every conscience Laws which none shall finde Left them inrould or what the Spirit within Shall on the heart engrave  What will they then But force the Spirit of Grace it self and binde His consort Libertie what but unbuild His living Temples built by Faith to stand Thir own Faith not anothers for on Earth Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard Infallible yet many will presume Whence heavie persecution shall arise On all who in the worship persevere Of Spirit and Truth the rest farr greater part Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes Religion satisfid Truth shall retire Bestuck with slandrous darts and works of Faith Rarely be found so shall the World goe on To good malignant to bad men benigne Under her own waight groaning till the day Appeer of respiration to the just And vengeance to the wicked at return Of him so lately promisd to thy aid The Womans seed obscurely then foretold Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord Last in the Clouds from Heavn to be reveald In glory of the Father to dissolve Satan with his perverted World then raise From the conflagrant mass purgd and refind New Heavns new Earth Ages of endless date Founded in righteousness and peace and love To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss  He ended and thus Adam last replyd  How soon hath thy prediction Seer blest Measurd this transient World the Race of time Till time stand fixt beyond is all abyss Eternitie whose end no eye can reach  Greatly instructed I shall hence depart Greatly in peace of thought and have my fill Of knowledge what this Vessel can containe Beyond which was my folly to aspire  Henceforth I learne that to obey is best And love with fear the onely God to walk As in his presence ever to observe His providence and on him sole depend Mercifull over all his works with good Still overcoming evil and by small Accomplishing great things by things deemd weak Subverting worldly strong and worldly wise By simply meek that suffering for Truths sake Is fortitude to highest victorie And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life Taught this by his example whom I now Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest  To whom thus also th Angel last replid This having learnt thou hast attaind the summe Of wisdome hope no higher though all the Starrs Thou knewst by name and all th ethereal Powers All secrets of the deep all Natures works Or works of God in Heavn Aire Earth or Sea And all the riches of this World enjoydst And all the rule one Empire onely add Deeds to thy knowledge answerable add Faith Add vertue Patience Temperance add Love By name to come calld Charitie the soul Of all the rest then wilt thou not be loath To leave this Paradise but shalt possess A paradise within thee happier farr  Let us descend now therefore from this top Of Speculation for the hour precise Exacts our parting hence and see the Guards By mee encampt on yonder Hill expect Thir motion at whose Front a flaming Sword In signal of remove waves fiercely round We may no longer stay go waken Eve Her also I with gentle Dreams have calmd Portending good and all her spirits composd To meek submission thou at season fit Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know The great deliverance by her Seed to come For by the Womans Seed on all Mankind  That ye may live which will be many dayes Both in one Faith unanimous though sad With cause for evils past yet much more cheerd With meditation on the happie end  He ended and they both descend the Hill Descended Adam to the Bowre where Eve Lay sleeping ran before but found her wakt And thus with words not sad she him receavd  Whence thou returnst and whither wentst I know For God is also in sleep and Dreams advise Which he hath sent propitious some great good Presaging since with sorrow and hearts distress Wearied I fell asleep but now lead on In mee is no delay with thee to goe Is to stay here without thee here to stay Is to go hence unwilling thou to mee Art all things under Heavn all places thou Who for my wilful crime art banisht hence  This further consolation yet secure I carry hence though all by mee is lost Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft By mee the Promisd Seed shall all restore  So spake our Mother Eve and Adam heard Well pleasd but answerd not for now too nigh Th Archangel stood and from the other Hill To thir fixt Station all in bright array The Cherubim descended on the ground Gliding meteorous as Evning Mist Risn from a River ore the marish glides And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel Homeward returning  High in Front advanct The brandisht Sword of God before them blazd Fierce as a Comet which with torrid heat And vapour as the Libyan Air adust Began to parch that temperate Clime whereat In either hand the hastning Angel caught Our lingring Parents and to th Eastern Gate Led them direct and down the Cliff as fast To the subjected Plaine then disappeerd  They looking back all th Eastern side beheld Of Paradise so late thir happie seat Wavd over by that flaming Brand the Gate With dreadful Faces throngd and fierie Armes Som natural tears they dropd but wipd them soon The World was all before them where to choose Thir place of rest and Providence thir guide They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow Through Eden took thir solitarie way
