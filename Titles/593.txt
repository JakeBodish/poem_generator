
I want to write my lover a poem
but a very bad one  Itll include
a giant squid and some loose change
 
and cuff links and two blue ferries chugging
headfirst on the East River at twenty-six knots
and only at the last minute averting
 
disaster through quick thinking and sure reflexes  Also
a bow and arrow and glossy red apple
I perch in front of my heart  To be honest
 
my lover doesnt really like poetry
which I guess is why I plan to write
such a bad one so he can feel right
 
and strong and good in his beliefs 
Tonight when I go see my lover
he’ll hold me as Ive never been held
 
except by him and then Ill have to give him
back  When you get new things
you treat them like glass for a while
 
and then get used to them
and manhandle them
like everything else 
 
I dont want to give him back
but partly its not up to me and
partly I dont want to be his
 
old sofa  I want to radiate and gleam
arrestingly until the certain premature
end  You can compose a whole life
 
out of these rollercoasters 
You can be everywhere
and nowhere over and over
life slapping you in the face
 till you’re newly burnished
flat-out gasping and awake
