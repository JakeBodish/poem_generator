
One rainy night we sat in trafficand overtired in back you sawa wind-whipped grocery bag afloatbeyond the clutch of jagged branches swept by gusts and whirled in eddies A sudden downdraft swooped it earthward where it danced till with a whoosha current luffed it past the power lines  Disowned by gravity small ghostnot yet snagged by twiggy fingersit couldn’t reach the earth  Thin-skinnedit pulsed translucent jellyfish You wept and pled to be let outinto the dark and slanted rainsomehow to save that desolate thing The light turned green and still you begged Go back go back on its behalfcaught and held bossed and tossedby a will much greater than its own
