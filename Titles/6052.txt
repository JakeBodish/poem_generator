I sing this body ad libitum Europe scraped raw between my teeth until presto “Ave Maria” floats to the surface from a Tituba  tributary of “Swanee ” Until I’m a legato darkling whole note my voice shimmering up from the Atlantic’s hold until I’m a coda of sail song whipped in salted wind until my chorus swells like a lynched tongue until the nocturnes boiling beneath the roof of my mouth extinguish each burning cross  I sing this life in testimony to tempo rubato to time stolen body by body by body by body from one passage to another I sing tremolo to the opus of loss  I sing this story staccato and stretto a fugue of blackface and blued-up arias   I sing with one hand smoldering in the steely canon the other lento slow languorous lingered in the fields of “Babylon’s Falling”
