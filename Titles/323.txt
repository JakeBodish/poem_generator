
Its a weary life it is she said
Doubly blank in a womans lot
I wish and I wish I were a man
Or better then any being were not
Were nothing at all in all the world
Not a body and not a soul
Not so much as a grain of dust
Or a drop of water from pole to pole 
Still the world would wag on the same
Still the seasons go and come
Blossoms bloom as in days of old
Cherries ripen and wild bees hum 
None would miss me in all the world
How much less would care or weep
I should be nothing while all the rest
Would wake and weary and fall asleep
