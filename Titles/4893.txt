
When you show yourself to the woman you love you don’t know your fearis not fear itself  You have never been goodbut now you are so goodwho are you Is it the liquidity of her skinthat bathes the world for youor her face captured like a she-lionin your own fleshThis summerbed is soft with ring upon ring upon ring of wedding the kindthat doesn’t clink upon contact the kindwith no contractthe kind in which the gold is only only light  Cloud covers and lifts and sleep and night and soon enough love’sbig fire laughs at a terrible burn but only only because pain absorbs excess joy and you shouldn’t flaunt your treasures in front of all day’s eyes
