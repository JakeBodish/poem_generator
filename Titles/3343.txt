
Drowned together in his car in Lake Chippewa 
It was a bright cold starry night on Lake Chippewa 
Lake Chippewa was a “living” lake then
though soon afterward it would choke and die 
In the bright cold morning after we could spy
them only through a patch of ice brushed clear of snow 
Scarcely three feet below
they were oblivious of us 
Together beneath the ice in each other’s arms 
Jean-Marie’s head rested on Troy’s shoulder 
Their hair had floated up and was frozen 
Their eyes were open in the perfect lucidity of death 
Calmly they sat upright  Not a breath
It was 1967 there were no seat belts
to keep them apart  Beautiful
as mannequins in Slater Brothers’ window 
Faces flawless not a blemish 
Yet you could believe
they might be breath-
ing for some trick
of scintillate light revealed
tiny bubbles in the ice
and a motion like a smile
in Jean-Marie’s perfect face 
How far Troy’d driven the car onto Lake Chippewa
before the ice creaked and cracked and opened
like the parting of giant jaws at least fifty feet
This was a feat like his 7-foot-3 8-inch high jump 
In the briny snow you could see the car tracks
along the shore where in summer sand
we’d sprawl and soak up sun
in defiance of skin carcinomas to come  And you could see
how deftly he’d turned the wheel onto the ice
at just the right place 
And on the ice you could see
how he’d made the tires spin and grab
and Jean-Marie clutching his hand Oh oh oh
The sinking would be silent and slow 
Eastern edge of Lake Chippewa shallower
than most of the lake but deep enough at twelve feet
to suck down Mr  Dupuy’s Chevy
so all that was visible from shore
was the gaping ice wound 
And then in the starry night
a drop to -5 degrees Fahrenheit
and ice freezing over the sunken car 
Who would have guessed it of Lake Chippewa
Now in the morning through the swept ice
there’s a shocking intimacy just below 
With our mittens we brush away powder snow 
With our boots we kick away ice chunks 
Lie flat and stare through the ice
Seeing Jean-Marie Schuter and Troy Dupuy
as we’d never seen them in life 
Our breaths steam in Sunday-morning light 
It will be something we must live with 
the couple do not care about our astonishment 
Perfect in love and needing no one to applaud
as they’d been oblivious of our applause
at the Herkimer Junior High prom where they were
crowned Queen and King three years before 
In Herkimer County New York you grew up fast 
The body matured the brain lagged behind
like the slowest runner on the track team
we’d applaud with affection mistaken for teen mockery 
No one wanted to summon help just yet 
It was a dreamy silence above ice as below 
And the ice a shifting hue silvery ghost-gray pale
blue as the sky shifts overhead
like a frowning parent  What
Lake Chippewa was where some of us went ice-fishing
with our grandfathers  Sometimes we skated 
Summers there were speedboats canoes  There’d been
drownings in Lake Chippewa we’d heard
but no one of ours 
Police fire-truck ambulance sirens would rend the air 
Strangers would shout at one another 
We’d be ordered back off the ice of Lake Chippewa
that shone with beauty and onto the littered shore 
By harsh daylight made to see
Mr  Dupuy’s 1963 Chevy
hooked like a great doomed fish 
All that privacy yanked upward pitiless
and streaming icy rivulets
We knew it was wrong to disturb the frozen lovers
and make of them mere bodies 
Sweet-lethal embrace of Lake Chippewa
But no embrace can survive thawing 
One of us Gordy Garrison would write a song
“Too Young to Marry But Not Too Young to Die”
echo of Bill Monroe’s “I Traced Her Little Footprints
in the Snow” which he’d sing with his band the Raiders
accompanying himself on the Little Martin guitar
he’d bought from his cousin Art Garrison
when Art enlisted in the U S  Navy and for a while
it was all you’d hear at Herkimer High where the Raiders
played for Friday-night dances in the gym but then
we graduated and things changed and nothing more
came of Gordy’s song or of the Raiders 
“TOO YOUNG TO MARRY BUT NOT TOO YOUNG TO DIE”
was the headline in the Herkimer Packet 
We scissored out the front-page article kept it for decades in a
bedroom drawer 
No one ever moves in Herkimer except
those who move away and never come back 
The clipping is yellowed deeply creased
and beginning to tear  When some of us stare
at the photos our hearts cease beating oh just a beat
It was something we’d learned to live with 
there’d been no boy desperate to die with any of us 
We’d have accepted probably yes 
Deep breath shuttered eyes yes Troy 
Secret kept yellowed and creased in the drawer
though if you ask laughingly we’d deny it 
 
We see Gordy sometimes and his wife June  Our grand-
children are friends  Hum Gordy’s old song
to make Gordy blush a fierce apricot hue
but it seems cruel we’re all on blood
thinners now
