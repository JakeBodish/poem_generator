
Brachest she called it gentling grease
over blanching yolks with an expertise
honed from three decades of dawns
at the Longhorn Diner in Loraine
where even the oldest in the old mens booth
swore as if it were scripture truth
theyd never had a breakfast better
rapping a glass sharply to get her
attention when it went sorrowing
so far into some simple thing 
the jangly door or a crusted pan
the wall clocks black hitchy hands 
that she would startle blink then grin
as if discovering them all again 
Who remembers now when one died
the space that he had occupied
went unfilled for a day then two three
until she unceremoniously
plunked plates down in the wrong places
and stared their wronged faces
back to banter she could hardly follow 
Unmarried childless homely slow
she knew coffee cut with chamomile
kept the grocer Pauls ulcer cool
yarrow in gravy eased the islands
of lesions in Larry Borwicks hands
and when some nightlong nameless urgency
sent him seeking human company
Brother Tom needed hash browns with cheese 
She knew to nod at the litany of cities
the big-rig long-haulers bragged her past
to laugh when the hunters asked
if shed pray for them or for the quail
they went laughing off to kill
and then envisioning one
rising so fast it seemed the sun
tugged at it to do exactly that 
Who remembers where they all sat
crook-backed builders drought-faced farmers
VFers muttering through their wars
night-shift roughnecks so caked in black
it seemed they made their way back
every morning from the dead 
Who remembers one word they said
The Longhorn Diners long torn down
the gin and feedlots gone the town
itself now nothing but a name
at which some bored boy has taken aim
every letter light-pierced and partial 
Sister Aunt Sissy Bera Thrailkill
I picture you one dime-bright dawn
grown even brighter now for being gone
bustling amid the formica and chrome
of that small house we both called home
during the spring that was your last 
All stories stop once more youre lost
in something I can merely see
steam spiriting out of black  coffee
the scorched pores of toast a bowl
of apple butter like edible soil
bald cloth knifelight the lip of a glass
my plates gleaming teeming emptiness
