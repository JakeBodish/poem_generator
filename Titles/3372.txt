
Fifty-nine days to go 
I cant find my purple beach towel 
I cant even get to my closet
without walking across
a sea of dirty socks 
Mom pokes her head into my doorway
says
“Time to clean your room Sophie ”
And I have to admit
shes right 
And its not that cleaning my room
is the worst thing to do 
Its just that there are so many other
better things to do
like 
painting my toenails Strawberry Pink
eating a huge stack of Uncle Joes pancakes
dreaming of riding the Ferris wheel
thinking up a story to tell
around the campfire
on Scary Story Night
painting shells
riding waves      
all the fun wonderful
sandy sunny things we do
at Summerhouse Time
