With a match I became a man who summoned dieselfrom the yellow cavernsof a ten-gallon jug called the flamenow hissing out the hose at the small house of  water thatrusted drum from which travelsan excruciating wetness   thisis what makes the body otherwise what makes itsing  To take that which has decided on a shape and bend without breaking the lengthening fibers  To give the straight thing curve  To make of  the tree a song grown long in a linseed skinthe slick hot strake waiting to become parcel of  the round world again
