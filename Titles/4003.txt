Here in the gloaming
a wormwood haze   
the “m” on its head
a “w” amazed
at what the
drink itself does
Vermouth

What really matters now is begonia
he thought distracted while reading   
their amber anther and bone-white petals
missing from a jade pot
by the door   not a theory of metaphor 3
In this corner sweet alyssum 
And beside it fragrant jessamine 
Almost rhyming scents in the air   
a syntax weaving their there there 4
Erodium holds
an eye in the pink
looping the white of
its tendering cup 5
The blue moon opens all
      too quickly and floats
      its head-
                     y fragrance over
                               the path
                  before us
And so we slit
its throat like a florist 6
These hearts-on-strings
     of the tenderest green
things that rise
from dirt
then fall
                  toward the floor
                                  hang
                            in
               the air
         like   
              hearts-
on-strings of the tenderest
green things   
     they rise from dirt
then fall toward
           the floor
    hanging in
                the air like   
                                 these
hearts-on-strings of the
tenderest green things
                                       rising
from dirt then falling
toward the floor
             hanging
      in the air like7
Moss-rose purslane portulaca
           petals feeling
     for the sun’s
light or is it
only warmth
or both
     they need
to open
an amethyst
           almost
see-through

Bou-
          gainvillea
lifts the sinking
spirit back
           up and nearly
into a buoyancy   
      its papery
pink bracts
proving with
their tease
     of a rustle and glow
through the window   
there is a breeze 9
Epistle-like chicory
blue beyond
the bars of these
    beds suspended
                  in air
what doesn’t dangle
elsewhere gives
way to plugged in

             purply thyme
against a golden
halo’s thistle 10
What’s a wandering
Jew to you
two who often do
wonder about
that moving about
Its purple stalk
torn-off and stuck
elsewhere in
the ground takes root
and soon shoots
forth a bluish
star with powder
on its pistil 
Such is the power
of that Jew
wherever it goes
unlike the rose
to make itself new
