
A FORM as any taper fine 
    A head like half-pint bason Where golden cords and bands entwine
    As rich as fleece of JASON A pair of shoulders strong and wide
    Like country clown enlisting Bare arms long dangling by the side
    And shoes of ragged listing Cravats like towels thick and broad
    Long tippets made of bear-skinMuffs that a RUSSIAN might applaud
    And rouge to spoil a fair skin Long petticoats to hide the feet
    Silk hose with clocks of scarlet A load of perfume sickning sweet
    Bought of PARISIAN VARLET A bush of hair the brow to shade
    Sometimes the eyes to cover A necklace that might be displayd
    By OTAHEITEAN lover A bowl of straw to deck the head
    Like porringer unmeaning A bunch of POPPIES flaming red
    With motly ribands streaming Bare ears on either side the head
    Like wood-wild savage SATYR Tinted with deep vermilion red
    To shame the blush of nature Red elbows gauzy gloves that add
    An icy covring merely A wadded coat the shape to pad
    Like Dutch-women   or nearly Such is CAPRICE  but lovely kind 
    Oh  let each mental featureProclaim the labour of the mind
    And leave your charms to NATURE
