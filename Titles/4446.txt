The milkmaids say Pray for their speech is reservedfixed here in circles of opalized light 
Presenting themselves without fancy or choicechapped hands on the full udder’s verge
y’know   cream-skinned gathering toad spume on skirtsrelentlessly cracking the snails underfoot  
a century later  more their compeers bow headsto these luminous fields made of ether
of blue  extravagant air calling up with the samenimble fingers their ciphered familiars
girl-souls at large in a nonhuman hour Speaking their argot  screen-practiced moue 
Not to you with your paper your man-heavy shoesuntouched by the mulch of the digital yard
They only gaze rapt at threshold milk spilled No purchase for you here Sir  no clue
