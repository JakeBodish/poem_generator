
For years my heart inquired of me
                   Where Jamshids sacred cup might be
And what was in its own possession
                   It asked from strangers constantly
Begging the pearl thats slipped its shell
                   From lost souls wandering by the sea 
Last night I took my troubles to
                   The Magian sage whose keen eyes see
A hundred answers in the wine
                   Whose cup he laughing showed to me 
I questioned him When was this cup
                   That shows the worlds reality
Handed to you He said The day
                   Heavens vault of lapis lazuli
Was raised and marvelous things took place
                   By Intellects divine decree
And Moses miracles were made
                   And Sameris apostasy 
He added then That friend they hanged   
                   High on the looming gallows tree 
His sin was that he spoke of things
                   Which should be pondered secretly
The page of truth his heart enclosed
                   Was annotated publicly 
But if the Holy Ghost once more
                   Should lend his aid to us wed see
Others perform what Jesus did 
                   Since in his heartsick anguish he
Was unaware that God was there
                   And called His name out ceaselessly 
I asked him next And beauties curls
                   That tumble down so sinuously
What is their meaning Whence do they come
                   Hafez the sage replied to me
Its your distracted lovelorn heart
                   That asks these questions constantly
