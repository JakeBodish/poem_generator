
He could not no he could not no althoughHe wheedled and cajoled begged and promisedBut they would not no they would notTake him to see The Curse of Frankenstein Then his uncle called and offered and they caved 
 So next it was the matinee then home And nothing said until he sat through dinner likeSome little diplomat and after that excused himselfAnd took his plate and headed up to bed Still nothing said  No but midnight he woke up screaming Morning his father cleared the plates then turned “That’s that” he summarized “too anatomical ”“What’s anatomical” the boy asked back 
This was summer 1957  Monarchs foraged flowers working colorsWith their yes-now-no-now light arrhythmias By afternoon leaves shimmered in the heatAnd in the evening intermittent waves Of fireflies telegraphed their kindWhile in the little deeps of darkened housesWindow units swallowed oceans of airUntil the boy deep in his house slept hard enoughThat when he woke he couldn’t close his hands “But what was anatomical” he asked again 
His father climbed a ladder to the attic where He bumped around then climbed back down Carrying an old foxed Gray’s AnatomyPacked full with illustrations what seeing these The boy felt certain were the pictures of mixed meats 
That night the windows purred and nothing budged Till breakfast brought another book this time One on pathology which meant more pictures plus Diseases where the worst were bestAnd came from “intimate contact ”
“But what was intimate” he later pestered Till his father downed his drink and said“That’s how you made your way into this world ”Mother rose and left the room  The boy sat silentHe sat there calmer than the noggin of a catUntil he stretched and yawning mentioned that He might just go on up and get to bed 
But secretly he understood he knew For good-and-always that in fact His father wasn’t a serious manSo he was on his own and had to make Sense out of things himself even if Some sense went wrong like Frankenstein’sWho wasn’t a serious man either  And that was really that even if it meant You’d sink one day without so much as SOS 
Some nights that summer sleepless eyes pinned wide He’d slip outdoors to watch his parents on the porchTheir cigarettes their quiet talk and thenFor nothing he could tell their laughter as His father fixed another round of drinks And after that more laughter like cicadas 
The boy watched this as now he sometimes drives The five miles out-of-way to see that house again And never-you-mind his knowing betterSometimes just his doing this sets off Imaginings that he is standing in the kitchenSaying “Oh my dear animal familyHow I loved you  How richly we purred ”
And sometimes too it sweeps back over him His thinking that his father wasn’t a serious man Those times slowing the car he says to himself“Well then you are not a serious man either ”
