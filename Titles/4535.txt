
Whose branch this is I think you know 
By how my question-marks as claws inscritch the bark 
How my worry-work along this bough
runs back and forth and copper-keen and evermore
I got mocked and nicked No-Fly Bird
not for nothing 
Not for nothing have I picked this oak 
Though not thicktrunk-ancient as some angel-oak
it’s sure the highest of our high so suits my lack 
 Charred wings won’t lift I’ve got no glide
nor span to speak of  Ain’t this my beat  my usual limb 
Ain’t this pecking carking pulse
my far and wide
