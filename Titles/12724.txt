
Fair tree for thy delightful shadeTis just that some return be madeSure some return is due from meTo thy cool shadows and to thee When thou to birds dost shelter giveThou music dost from them receiveIf travellers beneath thee stayTill storms have worn themselves awayThat time in praising thee they spendAnd thy protecting powr commend The shepherd here from scorching freedTunes to thy dancing leaves his reedWhilst his lovd nymph in thanks bestowsHer flowry chaplets on thy boughs Shall I then only silent beAnd no return be made by meNo let this wish upon thee waitAnd still to flourish be thy fate To future ages mayst thou standUntouchd by the rash workmans handTill that large stock of sap is spentWhich gives thy summers ornamentTill the fierce winds that vainly striveTo shock thy greatness whilst aliveShall on thy lifeless hour attendPrevent the axe and grace thy endTheir scatterd strength together callAnd to the clouds proclaim thy fallWho then their evning dews may spareWhen thou no longer art their careBut shalt like ancient heroes burnAnd some bright hearth be made thy urn
