  Th inhabitants of old JerusalemWere Jebusites the town so calld from themAnd theirs the native right But when the chosen people grew more strongThe rightful cause at length became the wrongAnd every loss the men of Jebus boreThey still were thought Gods enemies the more Thus worn and weakend well or ill contentSubmit they must to Davids governmentImpoverishd and deprivd of all commandTheir taxes doubled as they lost their landAnd what was harder yet to flesh and bloodTheir gods disgracd and burnt like common wood This set the heathen priesthood in a flameFor priests of all religions are the sameOf whatsoeer descent their godhead beStock stone or other homely pedigreeIn his defence his servants are as boldAs if he had been born of beaten gold The Jewish Rabbins though their EnemiesIn this conclude them honest men and wiseFor twas their duty all the learned thinkTespouse his cause by whom they eat and drink From hence began that plot the nations curseBad in itself but represented worse Raisd in extremes and in extremes decridWith oaths affirmd with dying vows denid Not weighd or winnowd by the multitudeBut swallowd in the mass unchewd and crude Some truth there was but dashd and brewd with liesTo please the fools and puzzle all the wise Succeeding times did equal folly callBelieving nothing or believing all Th Egyptian rites the Jebusites embracdWhere gods were recommended by their taste Such savry deities must needs be goodAs servd at once for worship and for food By force they could not introduce these godsFor ten to one in former days was odds So fraud was usd the sacrificers tradeFools are more hard to conquer than persuade Their busy teachers mingled with the JewsAnd rakd for converts even the court and stewsWhich Hebrew priests the more unkindly tookBecause the fleece accompanies the flock Some thought they Gods anointed meant to slayBy guns invented since full many a dayOur author swears it not but who can knowHow far the Devil and Jebusites may goThis plot which faild for want of common senseHad yet a deep and dangerous consequenceFor as when raging fevers boil the bloodThe standing lake soon floats into a floodAnd evry hostile humour which beforeSlept quiet in its channels bubbles oerSo several factions from this first fermentWork up to foam and threat the government Some by their friends more by themselves thought wiseOpposd the powr to which they could not rise Some had in courts been great and thrown from thenceLike fiends were hardend in impenitence Some by their monarchs fatal mercy grownFrom pardond rebels kinsmen to the throneWere raisd in powr and public office highStrong bands if bands ungrateful men could tie 
  Of these the false Achitophel was firstA name to all succeeding ages curst For close designs and crooked counsels fitSagacious bold and turbulent of witRestless unfixt in principles and placeIn powr unpleasd impatient of disgrace A fiery soul which working out its wayFretted the pigmy-body to decayAnd oer informd the tenement of clay A daring pilot in extremityPleasd with the danger when the waves went highHe sought the storms but for a calm unfitWould steer too nigh the sands to boast his wit Great wits are sure to madness near allidAnd thin partitions do their bounds divideElse why should he with wealth and honour blestRefuse his age the needful hours of restPunish a body which he could not pleaseBankrupt of life yet prodigal of easeAnd all to leave what with his toil he wonTo that unfeatherd two-leggd thing a sonGot while his soul did huddled notions tryAnd born a shapeless lump like anarchy In friendship false implacable in hateResolvd to ruin or to rule the state To compass this the triple bond he brokeThe pillars of the public safety shookAnd fitted Israel for a foreign yoke Then seizd with fear yet still affecting fameUsurpd a patriots all-atoning name So easy still it proves in factious timesWith public zeal to cancel private crimesHow safe is treason and how sacred illWhere none can sin against the peoples willWhere crowds can wink and no offence be knownSince in anothers guilt they find their own Yet fame deservd no enemy can grudgeThe statesman we abhor but praise the judge In Jewish courts neer sat an AbbethdinWith more discerning eyes or hands more cleanUnbribd unsought the wretched to redressSwift of dispatch and easy of access Oh had he been content to serve the crownWith virtues only proper to the gownOr had the rankness of the soil been freedFrom cockle that opprest the noble seedDavid for him his tuneful harp had strungAnd heavn had wanted one immortal song But wild ambition loves to slide not standAnd fortunes ice prefers to virtues landAchitophel grown weary to possessA lawful fame and lazy happinessDisdaind the golden fruit to gather freeAnd lent the crowd his arm to shake the tree Now manifest of crimes contrivd long sinceHe stood at bold defiance with his princeHeld up the buckler of the peoples causeAgainst the crown and skulkd behind the laws The wishd occasion of the plot he takesSome circumstances finds but more he makes By buzzing emissaries fills the earsOf listning crowds with jealousies and fearsOf arbitrary counsels brought to lightAnd proves the king himself a Jebusite Weak arguments which yet he knew full wellWere strong with people easy to rebel For governd by the moon the giddy JewsTread the same track when she the prime renewsAnd once in twenty years their scribes recordBy natural instinct they change their lord Achitophel still wants a chief and noneWas found so fit as warlike AbsalomNot that he wishd his greatness to createFor politicians neither love nor hateBut for he knew his title not allowdWould keep him still depending on the crowdThat kingly powr thus ebbing out might beDrawn to the dregs of a democracy Him he attempts with studied arts to pleaseAnd sheds his venom in such words as these

  In this short file Barzillai first appearsBarzillai crownd with honour and with yearsLong since the rising rebels he withstoodIn regions waste beyond the Jordans floodUnfortunately brave to buoy the stateBut sinking underneath his masters fateIn exile with his god-like prince he mourndFor him he sufferd and with him returnd The court he practisd not the courtiers artLarge was his wealth but larger was his heartWhich well the noblest objects knew to chooseThe fighting warrior and recording Muse His bed could once a fruitful issue boastNow more than half a fathers name is lost His eldest hope with every grace adorndBy me so Heavn will have it always mourndAnd always honourd snatchd in manhoods primeB unequal Fates and Providences crimeYet not before the goal of honour wonAll parts fulfilld of subject and of sonSwift was the race but short the time to run Oh narrow circle but of powr divineScanted in space but perfect in thy lineBy sea by land thy matchless worth was knownArms thy delight and war was all thy ownThy force infusd the fainting Tyrians proppdAnd haughty Pharaoh found his fortune stoppd Oh ancient honour Oh unconquerd HandWhom foes unpunishd never could withstandBut Israel was unworthy of thy nameShort is the date of all immoderate fame It looks as Heavn our ruin had designdAnd durst not trust thy fortune and thy mind Now free from earth thy disencumberd SoulMounts up and leaves behind the clouds and starry poleFrom thence thy kindred legions mayst thou bringTo aid the Guardian Angel of thy king Here stop my Muse here cease thy painful flightNo pinions can pursue immortal heightTell good Barzillai thou canst sing no moreAnd tell thy soul she should have fled beforeOr fled she with his life and left this verseTo hang on her departed patrons hearseNow take thy steepy flight from Heavn and seeIf thou canst find on earth another heAnother he would be too hard to findSee then whom thou canst see not far behind Zadoc the priest whom shunning powr and placeHis lowly mind advancd to Davids graceWith him the Sagan of JerusalemOf hospitable soul and noble stemHim of the western dome whose weighty senseFlows in fit words and heavenly eloquence The Prophets sons by such example ledTo learning and to loyalty were bredFor colleges on bounteous kings dependAnd never rebel was to arts a friend To these succeed the pillars of the lawsWho best could plead and best can judge a cause Next them a train of loyal peers ascendSharp judging Adriel the Muses friendHimself a Muse in Sanhedrins debateTrue to his prince but not a slave of state Whom Davids love with honours did adornThat from his disobedient son were torn Jotham of piercing wit and pregnant thoughtEndowd by Nature and by learning taughtTo move assemblies who but only tridThe worse awhile then chose the better sideNor chose alone but turnd the balance tooSo much the weight of one brave man can do Hushai the friend of David in distressIn public storms of manly steadfastnessBy foreign treaties he informd his youthAnd joind experience to his native truth His frugal care supplid the wanting throneFrugal for that but bounteous of his ownTis easy conduct when exchequers flowBut hard the task to manage well the lowFor sovereign power is too depressd or highWhen kings are forcd to sell or crowds to buy Indulge one labour more my weary MuseFor Amiel who can Amiels praise refuseOf ancient race by birth but nobler yetIn his own worth and without title greatThe Sanhedrin long time as chief he ruldTheir reason guided and their passion cooldSo dextrous was he in the crowns defenceSo formd to speak a loyal nations senseThat as their band was Israels tribes in smallSo fit was he to represent them all Now rasher charioteers the seat ascendWhose loose careers his steady skill commendThey like thunequal ruler of the dayMisguide the seasons and mistake the wayWhile he withdrawn at their mad labour smilesAnd safe enjoys the sabbath of his toils 
  These were the chief a small but faithful bandOf worthies in the breach who dard to standAnd tempt thunited fury of the land With grief they viewd such powerful engines bentTo batter down the lawful government A numerous faction with pretended frightsIn Sanhedrins to plume the regal rights The true successor from the court removdThe plot by hireling witnesses improvd These ills they saw and as their duty boundThey showd the king the danger of the woundThat no concessions from the throne would pleaseBut lenitives fomented the diseaseThat Absalom ambitious of the crownWas made the lure to draw the people downThat false Achitophels pernicious hateHad turnd the plot to ruin church and stateThe Council violent the rabble worseThat Shimei taught Jerusalem to curse 
  With all these loads of injuries opprestAnd long revolving in his careful breastThevent of things at last his patience tirdThus from his royal throne by Heavn inspirdThe god-like David spoke and awful fearHis train their Maker in their Master hear 
  Thus long have I by native mercy swaydMy wrongs dissembld my revenge delaydSo willing to forgive thoffending ageSo much the father did the king assuage But now so far my clemency they slightTh offenders question my forgiving right That one was made for many they contendBut tis to rule for thats a monarchs end They call my tenderness of blood my fearThough manly tempers can the longest bear Yet since they will divert my native courseTis time to shew I am not good by force Those heapd affronts that haughty subjects bringAre burdens for a camel not a kingKings are the public pillars of the stateBorn to sustain and prop the nations weightIf my young Sampson will pretend a callTo shake the column let him share the fallBut oh that yet he would repent and liveHow easy tis for parents to forgiveWith how few tears a pardon might be wonFrom Nature pleading for a darling sonPoor pitied youth by my paternal careRaisd up to all the heights his frame could bearHad God ordaind his fate for empire bornHe would have givn his soul another turnGulld with a patriots name whose modern senseIs one that would by law supplant his princeThe peoples brave the politicians toolNever was patriot yet but was a fool Whence comes it that religion and the lawsShould more be Absaloms than Davids causeHis old instructor eer he lost his placeWas never thought endued with so much grace Good heavns how faction can a patriot paintMy rebel ever proves my peoples saintWould they impose an heir upon the throneLet Sanhedrins be taught to give their own A kings at least a part of governmentAnd mine as requisite as their consentWithout my leave a future king to chooseInfers a right the present to deposeTrue they petition me tapprove their choiceBut Esaus hands suit ill with Jacobs voice My pious subjects for my safety prayWhich to secure they take my powr away From plots and treasons Heavn preserve my yearsBut save me most from my petitioners Unsatiate as the barren womb or graveGod cannot grant so much as they can crave What then is left but with a jealous eyeTo guard the small remains of royaltyThe law shall still direct my peaceful swayAnd the same law teach rebels to obeyVotes shall no more establishd powr controlSuch votes as make a part exceed the wholeNo groundless clamours shall my friends removeNor crowds have powr to punish ere they proveFor gods and god-like kings their care expressStill to defend their servants in distress Oh that my powr to saving were confindWhy am I forcd like Heavn against my mindTo make examples of another kindMust I at length the sword of justice drawOh curst effects of necessary lawHow ill my fear they by my mercy scanBeware the fury of a patient man Law they require let law then show her faceThey could not be content to look on graceHer hinder parts but with a daring eyeTo tempt the terror of her front and die By their own arts tis righteously decreedThose dire artificers of death shall bleed Against themselves their witnesses will swearTill viper-like their mother plot they tearAnd suck for nutriment that bloody goreWhich was their principle of life before Their Belial with the Belzebub will fightThus on my foes my foes shall do me rightNor doubt thevent for factious crowds engageIn their first onset all their brutal rageThen let em take an unresisted courseRetire and traverse and delude their forceBut when they stand all breathless urge the fightAnd rise upon em with redoubled mightFor lawful powr is still superior foundWhen long drivn back at length it stands the ground 
  He said  Th Almighty nodding gave consentAnd peals of thunder shook the firmament Henceforth a series of new time beganThe mighty years in long procession ranOnce more the god-like David was restordAnd willing nations knew their lawful lord
