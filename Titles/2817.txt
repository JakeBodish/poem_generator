
We thought nothing of it he saysthough some came so close to where we slept 
I try to see him as a boy
back in the Philippines waking
to the sound of machine guns 
His family would spend their morningspreading a paste over the sores 
of the house’s thick walls He tells how he touched 
points where bullets enteredhis fingers he says disappeared into the holes
as if inside there existed a space
where everything from this world could vanish Here we could place the memory of my sister 
his daughter who died after a car wreck Wedge her into the smoky path
                                                  cover her in sunlight The family next door is raking leaves in the yard A father scolds his children for jumping
into large piles he arranged into a crescent moon We cannot hear them from inside
but I feel they are frightened as he grabs both of them
                                                            around the waist  spins I wait for the ending to my father’s story
but he is too busy smiling as if enjoying the silenceof bullets frozen there in his mind
