
How to get close without going over 
How to feign lust for whatever’s on offer 
How the largest possible quantity
of anything is a lifetime  A lifetime
of oat bran  A lifetime of timing belts 
A lifetime of saying sure why noti’m only on earth x numberof years and not knowing what
to make x  Sometimes I pick a number
I’ve already passed  I remember
the gambler’s credo   when you only
have fifty bucks left in this world
you’d better get rid of it fast the last
thing you want is money around
reminding you every day of the money
you lost  The recommended
retirement plan is arabesque then leap
and smash on the seawall  We made
a promise not to catch each other
