
a sower walks into the great hall
its war out there he says
and you awash in emptiness
youve sworn off your duty to sound the alarm
Ive come in the name of fields
its war out there
I walk out from that great hall
all four directions a boundless harvest scene
I start planning for war
rehearsing death
and the crops I burn
send up the wolf-smoke of warning fires
but something haunts me furiously
hes sowing seed across marble floors
