
After a winter of gluttony  grief
Im back on plan for good this time 
I’ve ballooned to a specific kind of ugly
 
the kind you hope to hide
with body spray  But it gets worse
after a winter of gluttony  grief 
 
I’ve shown up for meatballs  For lemons
whipped to weeping  Now I land my balloon
for the specific kind of ugly
 
salad oil is  Happy date night darling 
Happy coconut water  nutritional yeast 
After this winter of gluttony  grief
 
spring comes stabbing her hard stem
of anger in the throat  Even garlic scapes
are flat balloons their ugliness specific
 
as my penmanship green tubes of spice
 hate  My body speaks the ugly testament
that took all winter  It says Gluttony  grief balloon darling  Only kindness is specific
