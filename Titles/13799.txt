
Egg-white house old
ache in the rafters
small as a button but
yearning for zero
a sparrow parts the chimney
and veers for my face 
I wanted my nevers
again my immaculate
touch-down to the durable
granite of love too
heavy to move this
gift implacable
birds-eye sorrow
reared from the original
fairy tales page 
I dont like it  I offered
no signature my nature
altered and Im over
my hurricane  Rocking
room to room this bird
threatens my gravity
threaded through like a pearl
from the evenings stem 
Didnt I break all
eighty-eight bones
of my compass my wingspan
spun from my awkwardness
This bird returns
to the shell with monstrous
wings wings clumsy as shovels
in a fist of dirt  Its covered
with ashes sloughing off
cloud caught
in my hair brown
tumor bulged upside
down on the floor
to meet the applause
this blessings too
unwieldy  But open
one door one terriblegoodbye hello the sparrow
flings like a shout for the trees
