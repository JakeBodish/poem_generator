The airport where all movies endthe scenery’s mobile the people toothe people want to be movedand the rounded stairways join set pieceslike farewells in a series arc  I don’tunderstand how you write good scriptswithout knowing there are gods  I’velearned the same things we’ve all learnedwhen a man runs through my hotel suiteI can expect another half a second later Also tell me why I keep two keysone of which unlocks something Also I know we know that you hell-owill have vanished before I finish saying thisand turn around  “You’ll do that” I’ll mention to the night and spin my swivel chairperusing the moment’s sunkenness  Meanwhilemy antivirus angel is checking every file We both know there’s a place you touchwhen your plane lifts off I won’t say wherea little bolt that takes the plot apartso closure is dismantled because from hereyou can admit that nothing’s ever ended well You have queued to show your documents You have left behind your possessionsfor the kind scientists  The stairs have spunaway and sunk and in losing your itineraryyour position is confirmed  Like the first timea woman sees a diamond she just knows
