We packed your satchel with sweatshirts
Soccer equipment and The Elements of Style
Loaded up the Hum Vee a sad drive to JFK
And the cross-country flight to starting college
where fortunately due to Advanced Placement
Courses you’ve already been awarded your MFA
And published your first book 
As we pulled out of the driveway I slammed
On the brakes and not on account of Jubilation
The neighbor’s cat  “Stacey” I said “we have jumped the gun ”
“I didn’t know we had a gun Pops” you said 
“This is a figure of speech a melonaphore 
But you can’t go to college yet
Stacey you’re barely by my count five years old ”
“That’s all right Daddy-O nice try 
But my name’s not Stacey ”
 
                                             2 PUPPY
 
Love this puppy and your love will be repaid 
I can’t stress how little this will teach you about life 
Which it will  Which is a lot 
Sometimes when you’re sad I won’t know what to say 
Desire will cut into the bone 
So much we need to cover before you’re on your own 
This is a tea kettle where goldfish won’t feel at home 
When I was your age before you were born
A war was almost certainly about to break out 
The Russians turned out to be just like us
Only worse drivers which is a lot like us too 
I had a pet once too you know  An accordion 
Very tough to train stained with fluids as it was
About which nothing further need be said 
Your questions matter  No they really do 
I have no clue as to the white carnations
No reason to suppose the stars were not meant for you 
 
                                              3 FISH
 
“Do fish sleep” I am so glad you asked  Once
Upon a time fish did not even catnap 
Childhood has reached a certain point 
More specific than that I cannot be
Or less  When you drive to Chartres
You can see it coming at you far away 
Never pass up a cathedral if you can 
Drink lots of water with the strawberries 
Leap before you look too hard which makes
Things swim in your head like fish that never sleep 
 
                                           4 BIRDS…
 
“Time’s come to talk to you about the birds ”
“And the bees”
“What do you know about the bees”
“Was just asking ”
“A falcon is one bird you can’t keep in a cage
I can’t explain why though I might point
To history for many instructive precedents ”
“You have trouble explaining Dad ”
“Anyway what I like about birds is they’re much
Like dreams they fly in through a window
Where you didn’t know there was a window before ”
“I get it  We open to the known and discover
Mysteries left in their place like putting under the pillow
A tooth that fell out and you come up with the cash
When you need it in the morning for school ”
“Let’s stay focussed Amy ” “Sure Reginald ”
“I mind it that you call me Reginald who’s he”
“Someday Dad I may fall in love ”
“Let’s go back to the birds  I don’t want to say
Love is for the ornithologists though such thoughts occur 
Maybe the real topic is experience ”
“I knew that ” “When” “You told me ” “I never ”
“Didn’t have to ” “That’s how you just know”
“Life’s a vale of tears Pops except when it’s not ”
“Hence sweetheart some birds thrive in cages ”
“Name three ” “I want you to try on some wings 
I want you to take flight  Like the day I gave birth…”
“What” “The day I gave birth to you was the day of days ”
“You feeling OK” “The epidural worked like a charm
I felt like I was swimming in air ” “I think you’re confused ”
“I wouldn’t be the first but when they handed you to me
You nursed till you fell asleep ” “You’re talking about love ”
“And some bees sting ”
 
                                              5 BOND
 
Once we had a bond a sacred trust 
I carried you on my shoulders we watched
The finches dart and feed I read The Odyssey 
To you which OK was a stretch but who cared
You did not exist Certainly not me 
But take the example of Homer 
Would you just give me a chance
There’s an old dog called Argus
Who waits for the hero to show before he dies 
I’m getting to the point  If we never had a dog
I would wait for you to arrive from a journey
Forced upon you by chance and fate 
You see the whole thing’s about waiting 
There you are off-stage readying yourself
For a grand entrance into a life none of us
Heretofore presumed  I myself ache
Barometrically in concert with the coming storms 
If you never are I have something left over
Even if it’s only me watching you wade in as if
You were a great swimmer and this world another shore
