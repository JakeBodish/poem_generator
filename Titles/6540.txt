
From the tawny light
from the rainy nights
from the imagination finding
itself and more than itself
alone and more than alone
at the bottom of the well where the moon lives   
can you pull me
into December a lowland
of space perception of space
towering of shadows of clouds blown upon
clouds over
                  new ground new made
under heavy December footsteps the only
way to live
