They woke him up by pissing in his face  He opened his mouth
to scream in Spanish so his mouth became a urinal at the ballpark 
Scott and Steve the Leader brothers celebrating a night at Fenway
where the Sox beat the Indians and a rookie named Rodríguez spun
the seams on his changeup to hypnotize the Tribe  Later that night
Steve urinated on the door of his cell and Scott told the cops why
they did it Donald Trump was right  All these illegals need to be deported

immigrant with papers crop-picker in the fields trader of bottles
and cans collected in his cart  Two strangers squashed the cartilage
in his nose like a can drained of beer  In dreams he would remember
the shoes digging into his ribcage the pole raked repeatedly across
his cheekbones and upraised knuckles the high-five over his body Donald Trump was right said Scott  And Trump said The people
that are following me are very passionate
