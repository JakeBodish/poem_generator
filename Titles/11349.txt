My pale stepdaughter just off the school bus  Scowled Well thats the last time I say my names  Snodgrass Just so may that anonymous  Mexican male who prodigally claims  My clan lines identity and the sixteen  Digits that unlock my bank account  Think twice  That less than proper names been  Taken by three ex-wives each for an amount  Past all youve squandered each more than pleased  To change it back  That surname you affect  May have more consequence than getting teased  By dumb kids or tracked down by bank detectives   Dont underrate its history one of ours played  Piano on his prisons weekly broadcast  One got rich on a scammed quiz show one made  A bungle costing the World Series  My own past  Could subject you to guilt by association  If you write anything more than false checks  Abandon all hope of large press publication  Or prizes critics shun the name like sex Without a condom  Whoever steals my purse  Helps chain me to my writing desk again  For fun and profit  So take thanks with my curse  May your pen name help send you to your pen
