
Here take my picture though I bid farewell Thine in my heart where my soul dwells shall dwell  Tis like me now but I dead twill be more When we are shadows both than twas before  When weather-beaten I come back my hand Perhaps with rude oars torn or sun beams tannd My face and breast of haircloth and my head With cares rash sudden storms being oerspread My bodya sack of bones broken within And powders blue stains scatterd on my skin If rival fools tax thee tohave lovd a man So foul and coarse as oh I may seem then This shall say what I was and thou shalt say Do his hurts reach me doth my worth decay Or do they reach his judging mind that he Should now love less what he did love to see That which in him was fair and delicate Was but the milk which in loves childish state Did nurse it who now is grown strong enough To feed on that which to disusd tastes seems tough
