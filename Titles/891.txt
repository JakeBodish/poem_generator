raisd To that bad eminence and from despair Thus high uplifted beyond hope aspires Beyond thus high insatiate to pursue Vain Warr with Heavn and by success untaught His proud imaginations thus displaid  Powers and Dominions Deities of Heavn For since no deep within her gulf can hold Immortal vigor though opprest and falln I give not Heavn for lost    From this descent Celestial vertues rising will appear More glorious and more dread then from no fall And trust themselves to fear no second fate Mee though just right and the fixt Laws of Heavn Did first create your Leader next free choice With what besides in Counsel or in Fight Hath bin achievd of merit yet this loss Thus farr at least recoverd hath much more Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne Yielded with full consent    The happier state In Heavn which follows dignity might draw Envy from each inferior but who here Will envy whom the highest place exposes Formost to stand against the Thunderers aim Your bulwark and condemns to greatest share Of endless pain where there is then no good For which to strive no strife can grow up there From Faction for none sure will claim in Hell Precedence none whose portion is so small Of present pain that with ambitious mind Will covet more    With this advantage then To union and firm Faith and firm accord More then can be in Heavn we now return To claim our just inheritance of old Surer to prosper then prosperity Could have assurd us and by what best way Whether of open Warr or covert guile We now debate who can advise may speak  He ceasd and next him Moloc Scepterd King Stood up the strongest and the fiercest Spirit That fought in Heavn now fiercer by despair His trust was with th Eternal to be deemd Equal in strength and rather then be less Card not to be at all with that care lost Went all his fear of God or Hell or worse He reckd not and these words thereafter spake  My sentence is for open Warr Of Wiles More unexpert I boast not them let those Contrive who need or when they need not now  For while they sit contriving shall the rest Millions that stand in Arms and longing wait The Signal to ascend sit lingring here Heavns fugitives and for thir dwelling place Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns By our delay no let us rather choose Armd with Hell flames and fury all at once Ore Heavns high Towrs to force resistless way Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms Against the Torturer when to meet the noise Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear Infernal Thunder and for Lightning see Black fire and horror shot with equal rage Among his Angels and his Throne it self Mixt with Tartarean Sulphur and strange fire His own invented Torments    But perhaps The way seems difficult and steep to scale With upright wing against a higher foe  Let such bethink them if the sleepy drench Of that forgetful Lake benumm not still That in our proper motion we ascend Up to our native seat descent and fall To us is adverse    Who but felt of late When the fierce Foe hung on our brokn Rear Insulting and pursud us through the Deep With what compulsion and laborious flight We sunk thus low   Th ascent is easie then Th event is feard should we again provoke Our stronger some worse way his wrath may find To our destruction if there be in Hell Fear to be worse destroyd what can be worse Then to dwell here drivn out from bliss condemnd In this abhorred deep to utter woe Where pain of unextinguishable fire Must exercise us without hope of end The Vassals of his anger when the Scourge Inexorably and the torturing hour Calls us to Penance   More destroyd then thus We should be quite abolisht and expire  What fear we then what doubt we to incense His utmost ire which to the highth enragd Will either quite consume us and reduce To nothing this essential happier farr Then miserable to have eternal being Or if our substance be indeed Divine And cannot cease to be we are at worst On this side nothing and by proof we feel Our power sufficient to disturb his Heavn And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme Though inaccessible his fatal Throne Which if not Victory is yet Revenge  He ended frowning and his look denouncd Desperate revenge and Battel dangerous To less then Gods    On th other side up rose Belial in act more graceful and humane A fairer person lost not Heavn he seemd For dignity composd and high exploit But all was false and hollow though his Tongue Dropt Manna and could make the worse appear The better reason to perplex and dash Maturest Counsels for his thoughts were low To vice industrious but to Nobler deeds Timorous and slothful yet he pleasd the ear And with perswasive accent thus began  I should be much for open Warr O Peers As not behind in hate if what was urgd Main reason to perswade immediate Warr Did not disswade me most and seem to cast Ominous conjecture on the whole success When he who most excels in fact of Arms In what he counsels and in what excels Mistrustful grounds his courage on despair And utter dissolution as the scope Of all his aim after some dire revenge  First what Revenge the Towrs of Heavn are filld With Armed watch that render all access Impregnable oft on the bordering Deep Encamp thir Legions or with obscure wing Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night Scorning surprize    Or could we break our way By force and at our heels all Hell should rise With blackest Insurrection to confound Heavns purest Light yet our great Enemy All incorruptible would on his Throne Sit unpolluted and th Ethereal mould Incapable of stain would soon expel Her mischief and purge off the baser fire Victorious    Thus repulsd our final hope Is flat despair we must exasperate Th Almighty Victor to spend all his rage And that must end us that must be our cure To be no more sad cure for who would loose Though full of pain this intellectual being Those thoughts that wander through Eternity To perish rather swallowd up and lost In the wide womb of uncreated night Devoid of sense and motion and who knows Let this be good whether our angry Foe Can give it or will ever how he can Is doubtful that he never will is sure  Will he so wise let loose at once his ire Belike through impotence or unaware To give his Enemies thir wish and end Them in his anger whom his anger saves To punish endless wherefore cease we then Say they who counsel Warr we are decreed Reservd and destind to Eternal woe Whatever doing what can we suffer more What can we suffer worse is this then worst Thus sitting thus consulting thus in Arms What when we fled amain pursud and strook With Heavns afflicting Thunder and besought The Deep to shelter us this Hell then seemd A refuge from those wounds or when we lay Chaind on the burning Lake that sure was worse  What if the breath that kindld those grim fires Awakd should blow them into sevenfold rage And plunge us in the flames or from above Should intermitted vengeance arm again His red right hand to plague us what if all Her stores were opend and this Firmament Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire Impendent horrors threatning hideous fall One day upon our heads while we perhaps Designing or exhorting glorious warr Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurld Each on his rock transfixt the sport and prey Of racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk Under yon boyling Ocean wrapt in Chains There to converse with everlasting groans Unrespited unpitied unrepreevd Ages of hopeless end this would be worse  Warr therefore open or conceald alike My voice disswades for what can force or guile With him or who deceive his mind whose eye Views all things at one view he from heavns highth All these our motions vain sees and derides Not more Almighty to resist our might Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles  Shall we then live thus vile the Race of Heavn Thus trampld thus expelld to suffer here Chains and these Torments better these then worse By my advice since fate inevitable Subdues us and Omnipotent Decree The Victors will    To suffer as to doe Our strength is equal nor the Law unjust That so ordains this was at first resolvd If we were wise against so great a foe Contending and so doubtful what might fall  I laugh when those who at the Spear are bold And ventrous if that fail them shrink and fear What yet they know must follow to endure Exile or ignominy or bonds or pain The sentence of thir Conquerour This is now Our doom which if we can sustain and bear Our Supream Foe in time may much remit His anger and perhaps thus farr removd Not mind us not offending satisfid With what is punisht whence these raging fires Will slackn if his breath stir not thir flames  Our purer essence then will overcome Thir noxious vapour or enurd not feel Or changd at length and to the place conformd In temper and in nature will receive Familiar the fierce heat and void of pain This horror will grow milde this darkness light Besides what hope the never-ending flight Of future dayes may bring what chance what change Worth waiting since our present lot appeers For happy though but ill for ill not worst If we procure not to our selves more woe  Thus Belial with words cloathd in reasons garb Counseld ignoble ease and peaceful sloath Not peace and after him thus Mammon spake  Either to disinthrone the King of Heavn We warr if warr be best or to regain Our own right lost him to unthrone we then May hope when everlasting Fathe shall yeild To fickle Chance and Chaos judge the strife The former vain to hope argues as vain The latter for what place can be for us Within Heavns bound unless Heavns Lord supream We overpower   Suppose he should relent And publish Grace to all on promise made Of new Subjection with what eyes could we Stand in his presence humble and receive Strict Laws imposd to celebrate his Throne With warbld Hymns and to his God head sing Forct Halleluias while he Lordly sits Our envied Sovran and his Altar breathes Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers Our servile offerings    This must be our task In Heavn this our delight how wearisom Eternity so spent in worship paid To whom we hate    Let us not then pursue By force impossible by leave obtaind Unacceptable though in Heavn our state Of splendid vassalage but rather seek Our own good from our selves and from our own Live to our selves though in this vast recess Free and to none accountable preferring Hard liberty before the easie yoke Of servile Pomp    Our greatness will appeer Then most conspicuous when great things of small Useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse We can create and in what place so ere Thrive under evil and work ease out of pain Through labour and indurance    This deep world Of darkness do we dread How oft amidst Thick clouds and dark doth Heavns all-ruling Sire Choose to reside his Glory unobscurd And with the Majesty of darkness round Covers his Throne from whence deep thunders roar Mustring thir rage and Heavn resembles Hell As he our darkness cannot we his Light Imitate when we please This Desart soile Wants not her hidden lustre Gemms and Gold Nor want we skill or Art from whence to raise Magnificence and what can Heavn shew more Our torments also may in length of time Become our Elements these piercing Fires As soft as now severe our temper changd Into their temper which must needs remove The sensible of pain    All things invite To peaceful Counsels and the settld State Of order how in safety best we may Compose our present evils with regard Of what we are and were dismissing quite All thoughts of warr ye have what I advise  He scarce had finisht when such murmur filld Th Assembly as when hollow Rocks retain The sound of blustring winds which all night long Had rousd the Sea now with hoarse cadence lull Sea-faring men orewatcht whose Bark by chance Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay After the Tempest   Such applause was heard As Mammon ended and his Sentence pleasd Advising peace for such another Field They dreaded worse then Hell so much the fear Of Thunder and the Sword of Michael Wrought still within them and no less desire To found this nether Empire which might rise By pollicy and long process of time In emulation opposite to Heavn  Which when Beelzebub perceivd then whom Satan except none higher sat with grave Aspect he rose and in his rising seemd A Pillar of State deep on his Front engraven Deliberation sat and public care And Princely counsel in his face yet shon Majestic though in ruin sage he stood With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear The weight of mightiest Monarchies his look Drew audience and attention still as Night Or Summers Noon-tide air while thus he spake  Thrones and Imperial Powers off-spring of heavn Ethereal Vertues or these Titles now Must we renounce and changing stile be calld Princes of Hell for so the popular vote Inclines here to continue and build up here A growing Empire doubtless while we dream And know not that the King of Heavn hath doomd This place our dungeon not our safe retreat Beyond his Potent arm to live exempt From Heavns high jurisdiction in new League Banded against his Throne but to remaine In strictest bondage though thus far removd Under th inevitable curb reservd His captive multitude For he be sure In heighth or depth still first and last will Reign Sole King and of his Kingdom loose no part By our revolt but over Hell extend His Empire and with Iron Scepter rule Us here as with his Golden those in Heavn  What sit we then projecting peace and Warr Warr hath determind us and foild with loss Irreparable tearms of peace yet none Voutsaft or sought for what peace will be givn To us enslavd but custody severe And stripes and arbitrary punishment Inflicted and what peace can we return But to our power hostility and hate Untamd reluctance and revenge though slow Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least May reap his conquest and may least rejoyce In doing what we most in suffering feel Nor will occasion want nor shall we need With dangerous expedition to invade Heavn whose high walls fear no assault or Siege Or ambush from the Deep    What if we find Some easier enterprize There is a place If ancient and prophetic fame in Heavn Err not another World the happy seat Of some new Race calld Man about this time To be created like to us though less In power and excellence but favourd more Of him who rules above so was his will Pronouncd among the Gods and by an Oath That shook Heavns whol circumference confirmd  Thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn What creatures there inhabit of what mould Or substance how endud and what thir Power And where thir weakness how attempted best By force or suttlety Though Heavn be shut And Heavns high Arbitrator sit secure In his own strength this place may lye exposd The utmost border of his Kingdom left To their defence who hold it here perhaps Som advantagious act may be achievd By sudden onset either with Hell fire To waste his whole Creation or possess All as our own and drive as we were driven The punie habitants or if not drive Seduce them to our Party that thir God May prove thir foe and with repenting hand Abolish his own works    This would surpass Common revenge and interrupt his joy In our Confusion and our joy upraise In his disturbance when his darling Sons HurId headlong to partake with us shall curse Thir frail Original and faded bliss Faded so soon    Advise if this be worth Attempting or to sit in darkness here Hatching vain Empires  Thus Beelzebub Pleaded his devilish Counsel first devisd By Satan and in part proposd for whence But from the Author of all ill could Spring So deep a malice to confound the race Of mankind in one root and Earth with Hell To mingle and involve done all to spite The great Creatour   But thir spite still serves His glory to augment    The bold design Pleasd highly those infernal States and joy Sparkld in all thir eyes with full assent They vote whereat his speech he thus renews  Well have ye judgd well ended long debate Synod of Gods and like to what ye are Great things resolvd which from the lowest deep Will once more lift us up in spight of Fate Neerer our ancient Seat perhaps in view Of those bright confines whence with neighbouring Arms And opportune excursion we may chance Re-enter Heavn or else in some milde Zone Dwell not unvisited of Heavns fair Light Secure and at the brightning Orient beam Purge off this gloom the soft delicious Air To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires Shall breathe her balme    But first whom shall we send In search of this new world whom shall we find Sufficient who shall tempt with wandring feet The dark unbottomd infinite Abyss And through the palpable obscure find out His uncouth way or spread his aerie flight Upborn with indefatigable wings Over the vast abrupt ere he arrive The happy Ile what strength what art can then Suffice or what evasion bear him safe Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick Of Angels watching round   Here he had need All circumspection and we now no less Choice in our suffrage for on whom we send The weight of all and our last hope relies  This said he sat and expectation held His look suspence awaiting who appeerd To second or oppose or undertake The perilous attempt but all sat mute Pondering the danger with deep thoughts and each In others countnance read his own dismay Astonisht none among the choice and prime Of those Heavn-warring Champions could be found So hardie as to proffer or accept Alone the dreadful voyage till at last Satan whom now transcendent glory raisd Above his fellows with Monarchal pride Conscious of highest worth unmovd thus spake  O Progeny of Heavn Empyreal Thrones With reason hath deep silence and demurr Seisd us though undismaid long is the way And hard that out of Hell leads up to light Our prison strong this huge convex of Fire Outrageous to devour immures us round Ninefold and gates of burning Adamant Barrd over us prohibit all egress  These past if any pass the void profound Of unessential Night receives him next Wide gaping and with utter loss of being Threatens him plungd in that abortive gulf  If thence he scape into whatever world Or unknown Region what remains him less Then unknown dangers and as hard escape  But I should ill become this Throne O Peers And this Imperial Sovranty adornd With splendor armd with power if aught proposd And judgd of public moment in the shape Of difficulty or danger could deterr Mee from attempting    Wherefore do I assume These Royalties and not refuse to Reign Refusing to accept as great a share Of hazard as of honour due alike To him who Reigns and so much to him due Of hazard more as he above the rest High honourd sits Go therfore mighty Powers Terror of Heavn though falln intend at home While here shall be our home what best may ease The present misery and render Hell More tollerable if there be cure or charm To respite or deceive or slack the pain Of this ill Mansion intermit no watch Against a wakeful Foe while I abroad Through all the Coasts of dark destruction seek Deliverance for us all this enterprize None shall partake with me    Thus saying rose The Monarch and prevented all reply Prudent least from his resolution raisd Others among the chief might offer now Certain to be refusd what erst they feard And so refusd might in opinion stand His Rivals winning cheap the high repute Which he through hazard huge must earn    But they Dreaded not more th adventure then his voice Forbidding and at once with him they rose Thir rising all at once was as the sound Of Thunder heard remote  Towards him they bend With awful reverence prone and as a God Extoll him equal to the highest in Heavn Nor faild they to express how much they praisd That for the general safety he despisd His own for neither do the Spirits damnd Loose all thir virtue least bad men should boast Thir specious deeds on earth which glory excites Or clos ambition varnisht ore with zeal  Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds Ascending while the North wind sleeps orespread Heavns chearful face the lowring Element Scowls ore the darknd lantskip Snow or showre If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet Extend his evning beam the fields revive The birds thir notes renew and bleating herds Attest thir joy that hill and valley rings  O shame to men   Devil with Devil damnd Firm concord holds men onely disagree Of Creatures rational though under hope Of heavenly Grace and God proclaiming peace Yet live in hatred enmity and strife Among themselves and levie cruel warres Wasting the Earth each other to destroy As if which might induce us to accord Man had not hellish foes anow besides That day and night for his destruction waite  The Stygian Counsel thus dissolvd and forth In order came the grand infernal Peers Midst came thir mighty Paramount and seemd Alone th Antagonist of Heavn nor less Than Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream And God-like imitated State him round A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclosd With bright imblazonrie and horrent Arms  Then of thir Session ended they bid cry With Trumpets regal sound the great result Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie By Haralds voice explaind the hollow Abyss Heard farr and wide and all the host of Hell With deafning shout returnd them loud acclaim  Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat raisd By false presumptuous hope the ranged powers Disband and wandring each his several way Pursues as inclination or sad choice Leads him perplext where he may likeliest find Truce to his restless thoughts and entertain The irksom hours till this great Chief return  Part on the Plain or in the Air sublime Upon the wing or in swift Race contend As at th Olympian Games or Pythian fields Part curb thir fierie Steeds or shun the Goal With rapid wheels or fronted Brigads form  As when to warn proud Cities warr appears Wagd in the troubld Skie and Armies rush To Battel in the Clouds before each Van Prick forth the Aerie Knights and couch thir Spears Till thickest Legions close with feats of Arms From either end of Heavn the welkin burns  Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell Rend up both Rocks and Hills and ride the Air In whirlwind Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar  As when Alcides from Oechalia Crownd With conquest felt th envenomd robe and tore Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw Into th Euboic Sea    Others more milde Retreated in a silent valley sing With notes Angelical to many a Harp Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall By doom of Battel and complain that Fate Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance  Thir Song was partial but the harmony What could it less when Spirits immortal sing Suspended Hell and took with ravishment The thronging audience    In discourse more sweet For Eloquence the Soul Song charms the Sense Others apart sat on a Hill retird In thoughts more elevate and reasond high Of Providence Foreknowledge Will and Fate Fixt Fate free will foreknowledg absolute And found no end in wandring mazes lost  Of good and evil much they argud then Of happiness and final misery Passion and Apathie and glory and shame Vain wisdom all and false Philosophie Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm Pain for a while or anguish and excite Fallacious hope or arm th obdured brest With stubborn patience as with triple steel  Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands On bold adventure to discover wide That dismal world if any Clime perhaps Might yield them easier habitation bend Four ways thir flying March along the Banks Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate Sad Acheron of sorrow black and deep Cocytus namd of lamentation loud Heard on the ruful stream fierce Phlegeton Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage  Farr off from these a slow and silent stream Lethe the River of Oblivion roules Her watrie Labyrinth whereof who drinks Forthwith his former state and being forgets Forgets both joy and grief pleasure and pain  Beyond this flood a frozen Continent Lies dark and wilde beat with perpetual storms Of Whirlwind and dire Hail which on firm land Thaws not but gathers heap and ruin seems Of ancient pile all else deep snow and ice A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old Where Armies whole have sunk the parching Air Burns frore and cold performs th effect of Fire  Thither by harpy-footed Furies haild At certain revolutions all the damnd Are brought and feel by turns the bitter change Of fierce extreams extreams by change more fierce From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice Thir soft Ethereal warmth and there to pine Immovable infixt and frozen round Periods of time thence hurried back to fire  They ferry over this Lethean Sound Both to and fro thir sorrow to augment And wish and struggle as they pass to reach The tempting stream with one small drop to loose In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe All in one moment and so neer the brink But Fate withstands and to oppose th attempt Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards The Ford and of it self the water flies All taste of living wight as once it fled The lip of Tantalus    Thus roving on In confusd march forlorn th adventrous Bands With shuddring horror pale and eyes agast Viewd first thir lamentable lot and found No rest through many a dark and drearie Vaile They passd and many a Region dolorous Ore many a Frozen many a fierie Alpe Rocks Caves Lakes Fens Bogs Dens and shades of death A Universe of death which God by curse Created evil for evil only good Where all life dies death lives and Nature breeds Perverse all monstrous all prodigious things Abominable inutterable and worse Than Fables yet have feignd or fear conceivd Gorgons and Hydras and Chimeras dire  Mean while the Adversary of God and Man Satan with thoughts inflamd of highest design Puts on swift wings and towards the Gates of Hell Explores his solitary flight som times He scours the right hand coast som times the left Now shaves with level wing the Deep then soares Up to the fiery Concave touring high  As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descrid Hangs in the Clouds by Aequinoctial Winds Close sailing from Bengala or the Iles Of Ternate and Tidore whence Merchants bring Thir spicie Drugs they on the Trading Flood Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole    So seemd Farr off the flying Fiend at last appeer Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof And thrice threefold the Gates three folds were Brass Three Iron three of Adamantine Rock Impenetrable impald with circling fire Yet unconsumd    Before the Gates there sat On either side a formidable shape The one seemd Woman to the waste and fair But ended foul in many a scaly fould Voluminous and vast a Serpent armd With mortal sting about her middle round A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing barkd With wide Cerberian mouths full loud and rung A hideous Peal yet when they list would creep If aught disturbd thir noyse into her woomb And kennel there yet there still barkd and howld Within unseen    Farr less abhorrd than these Vexd Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts Calabria from the hoarce Trinacrian shore Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag when calld In secret riding through the Air she comes Lurd with the smell of infant blood to dance With Lapland Witches while the labouring Moon Eclipses at thir charms    The other shape If shape it might be calld that shape had none Distinguishable in member joynt or limb Or substance might be calld that shadow seemd For each seemd either black it stood as Night Fierce as ten Furies terrible as Hell And shook a dreadful Dart what seemd his head The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on  Satan was now at hand and from his seat The Monster moving onward came as fast With horrid strides Hell trembled as he strode  Th undaunted Fiend what this might be admird Admird not feard God and his Son except Created thing naught valud he nor shund And with disdainful look thus first began  Whence and what art thou execrable shape That darst though grim and terrible advance Thy miscreated Front athwart my way To yonder Gates through them I mean to pass That be assurd without leave askt of thee Retire or taste thy folly and learn by proof Hell-born not to contend with Spirits of Heavn  To whom the Goblin full of wrauth replyd Art thou that Traitor Angel art thou hee Who first broke peace in Heavn and Faith till then Unbrokn and in proud rebellious Arms Drew after him the third part of Heavns Sons Conjurd against the highest for which both Thou And they outcast from God are here condemnd To waste Eternal dayes in woe and pain And recknst thou thy self with Spirits of Heavn Hell-doomd and breathst defiance here and scorn Where I reign King and to enrage thee more Thy King and Lord   Back to thy punishment False fugitive and to thy speed add wings Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue Thy lingring or with one stroke of this Dart Strange horror seise thee and pangs unfelt before  So spake the grieslie terrour and in shape So speaking and so threatning grew tenfold More dreadful and deform on th other side Incenst with indignation Satan stood Unterrifid and like a Comet burnd That fires the length of Ophiucus huge In th Artick Sky and from his horrid hair Shakes Pestilence and Warr    Each at the Head Leveld his deadly aime thir fatall hands No second stroke intend and such a frown Each cast at th other as when two black Clouds With Heavns Artillery fraught come rattling on Over the Caspian then stand front to front Hovring a space till Winds the signal blow To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air So frownd the mighty Combatants that Hell Grew darker at thir frown so matcht they stood For never but once more was either like To meet so great a foe and now great deeds Had been achievd whereof all Hell had rung Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat Fast by Hell Gate and kept the fatal Key Risn and with hideous outcry rushd between  O Father what intends thy hand she cryd Against thy only Son   What fury O Son Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart Against thy Fathers head and knowst for whom For him who sits above and laughs the while At thee ordaind his drudge to execute What ere his wrath which he calls justice bids His wrath which one day will destroy ye both  She spake and at her words the hellish Pest Forbore then these to her Satan returnd So strange thy outcry and thy words so strange Thou interposest that my sudden hand Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds What it intends till first I know of thee What thing thou art thus double-formd and why In this infernal Vaile first met thou callst Me Father and that Fantasm ca11st my Son I know thee not nor ever saw till now Sight more detestable then him and thee  T whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate replyd Hast thou forgot me then and do I seem Now in thine eyes so foul once deemd so fair In Heavn when at th Assembly and in sight Of all the Seraphim with thee combind In bold conspiracy against Heavns King All on a sudden miserable pain Surprisd thee dim thine eyes and dizzie swumm In darkness while thy head flames thick and fast Threw forth till on the left side opning wide Likest to thee in shape and countnance bright Then shining heavnly fair a Goddess armd Out of thy head I sprung amazement seisd All th Host of Heavn back they recoild affraid At first and calld me Sin and for a Sign Portentous held me but familiar grown I pleasd and with attractive graces won The most averse thee chiefly who full oft Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing Becamst enamourd and such joy thou tookst With me in secret that my womb conceivd A growing burden    Mean while Warr arose And fields were fought in Heavn wherein remaind For what could else to our Almighty Foe Cleer Victory to our part loss and rout Through all the Empyrean down they fell Drivn headlong from the Pitch of Heaven down Into this Deep and in the general fall I also at which time this powerful Key Into my hand was givn with charge to keep These Gates for ever shut which none can pass Without my opning    Pensive here I sat Alone but long I sat not till my womb Pregnant by thee and now excessive grown Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes  At last this odious offspring whom thou seest Thine own begotten breaking violent way Tore through my entrails that with fear and pain Distorted all my nether shape thus grew Transformd but he my inbred enemie Forth issud brandishing his fatal Dart Made to destroy I fled and cryd out Death Hell trembld at the hideous Name and sighd From all her Caves and back resounded Death  I fled but he pursud though more it seems Inflamd with lust then rage and swifter far Mee overtook his mother all dismaid And in embraces forcible and foule Ingendring with me of that rape begot These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry Surround me as thou sawst hourly conceivd And hourly born with sorrow infinite To me for when they list into the womb That bred them they return and howle and gnaw My Bowels thir repast then bursting forth A fresh with conscious terrours vex me round That rest or intermission none I find  Before mine eyes in opposition sits Grim Death my Son and foe who sets them on And me his Parent would full soon devour For want of other prey but that he knows His end with mine involvd and knows that I Should prove a bitter Morsel and his bane When ever that shall be so Fate pronouncd  But thou O Father I forewarn thee shun His deadly arrow neither vainly hope To be invulnerable in those bright Arms Though temperd heavnly for that mortal dint Save he who reigns above none can resist  She finishd and the suttle Fiend his lore Soon learnd now milder and thus answerd smooth  Dear Daughter since thou claimst me for thy Sire And my fair Son here showst me the dear pledge Of dalliance had with thee in Heavn and joys Then sweet now sad to mention through dire change Befalln us unforeseen unthought of know I come no enemie but to set free From out this dark and dismal house of pain Both him and thee and all the heavnly Host Of Spirits that in our just pretenses armd Fell with us from on high from them I go This uncouth errand sole and one for all My self expose with lonely steps to tread Th unfounded deep and through the void immense To search with wandring quest a place foretold Should be and by concurring signs ere now Created vast and round a place of bliss In the Pourlieues of Heavn and therein plact A race of upstart Creatures to supply Perhaps our vacant room though more removd Least Heavn surchargd with potent multitude Might hap to move new broiles Be this or aught Then this more secret now designd I haste To know and this once known shall soon return And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death Shall dwell at ease and up and down unseen Wing silently the buxom Air imbalmd With odours there ye shall be fed and filld Immeasurably all things shall be your prey  He ceasd for both seemd highly pleasd and Death Grinnd horrible a gastly smile to hear His famine should be filld and blest his mawe Destind to that good hour no less rejoycd His mother bad and thus bespake her Sire  The key of this infernal Pit by due And by command of Heavns all-powerful King I keep by him forbidden to unlock These Adamantine Gates against all force Death ready stands to interpose his dart Fearless to be ormatcht by living might  But what ow I to his commands above Who hates me and hath hither thrust me down Into this gloom of Tartarus profound To sit in hateful Office here confind Inhabitant of Heavn and heavnlie-born Here in perpetual agonie and pain With terrors and with clamors compasst round Of mine own brood that on my bowels feed Thou art my Father thou my Author thou My being gavst me whom should I obey But thee whom follow thou wilt bring me soon To that new world of light and bliss among The Gods who live at ease where I shall Reign At thy right hand voluptuous as beseems Thy daughter and thy darling without end  Thus saying from her side the fatal Key Sad instrument of all our woe she took And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew Which but her self not all the Stygian powers Could once have movd then in the key-hole turns Th intricate wards and every Bolt and Bar Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease Unfastns on a sudden opn flie With impetuous recoile and jarring sound Th infernal dores and on thir hinges grate Harsh Thunder that the lowest bottom shook Of Erebus    She opnd but to shut Exceld her power the Gates wide opn stood That with extended wings a Bannerd Host Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array So wide they stood and like a Furnace mouth Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame  Before thir eyes in sudden view appear The secrets of the hoarie deep a dark Illimitable Ocean without bound Without dimension where length breadth  highth And time and place are lost where eldest Night And Chaos    Ancestors of Nature hold Eternal Anarchie amidst the noise Of endless Warrs and by confusion stand  For hot cold moist and dry four Champions fierce Strive here for Maistrie and to Battel bring Thir embryon Atoms they around the flag Of each his Faction in thir several Clanns Light-armd or heavy sharp smooth swift or slow Swarm populous unnumberd as the Sands Of Barca or Cyrenes torrid soil Levied to side with warring Winds and poise Thir lighter wings    To whom these most adhere Hee rules a moment Chaos Umpire sits And by decision more imbroiles the fray By which he Reigns next him high Arbiter Chance governs all    Into this wilde Abyss The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave Of neither Sea nor Shore nor Air nor Fire But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt Confusdly and which thus must ever fight Unless th Almighty Maker them ordain His dark materials to create more Worlds Into this wild Abyss the warie fiend Stood on the brink of Hell and lookd a while Pondering his Voyage for no narrow frith He had to cross    Nor was his eare less peald With noises loud and ruinous to compare Great things with small then when Bellona storms With all her battering Engines bent to rase Som Capital City or less then if this frame Of Heavn were falling and these Elements In mutinie had from her Axle torn The stedfast Earth    At last his Sail-broad Vannes He spreads for flight and in the surging smoak Uplifted spurns the ground thence many a League As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides Audacious but that seat soon failing meets A vast vacuitie all unawares Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops Ten thousand fadom deep and to this hour Down had been falling had not by ill chance The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him As many miles aloft that furie stayd Quencht in a Boggie Syrtis neither Sea Nor good dry Land nigh founderd on he fares Treading the crude consistence half on foot Half flying behoves him now both Oare and Saile  As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale Pursues the Arimaspian who by stelth Had from his wakeful custody purloind The guarded Gold So eagerly the fiend Ore bog or steep through strait rough dense or rare With head hands wings or feet pursues his way And swims or sinks or wades or creeps or flyes At length a universal hubbub wilde Of stunning sounds and voices all confusd Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare With loudest vehemence thither he plyes Undaunted to meet there what ever power Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss Might in that noise reside of whom to ask Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes Bordering on light when strait behold the Throne Of Chaos and his dark Pavilion spread Wide on the wasteful Deep with him Enthrond Sat Sable-vested Night eldest of things The Consort of his Reign and by them stood Orcus and Ades and the dreaded name Of Demogorgon Rumor next and Chance And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild And Discord with a thousand various mouths  T whom Satan turning boldly thus  Ye Powers And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss Chaos and ancient Night I come no Spy With purpose to explore or to disturb The secrets of your Realm but by constraint Wandring this darksome Desart as my way Lies through your spacious Empire up to light Alone and without guide half lost I seek What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds Confine with Heavn or if som other place From your Dominion won th Ethereal King Possesses lately thither to arrive I travel this profound direct my course Directed no mean recompence it brings To your behoof if I that Region lost All usurpation thence expelld reduce To her original darkness and your sway Which is my present journey and once more Erect the Standard there of ancient Night Yours be th advantage all mine the revenge  Thus Satan and him thus the Anarch old With faultring speech and visage incomposd Answerd  I know thee stranger who thou art That mighty leading Angel who of late Made head against Heavns King though overthrown  I saw and heard for such a numerous Host Fled not in silence through the frighted deep With ruin upon ruin rout on rout Confusion worse confounded and Heavn Gates Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands Pursuing    I upon my Frontieres here Keep residence if all I can will serve That little which is left so to defend Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles Weakning the Scepter of old Night first Hell Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath Now lately Heaven and Earth another World Hung ore my Realm linkd in a golden Chain To that side Heavn from whence your Legions fell If that way be your walk you have not farr So much the neerer danger go and speed Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain  He ceasd and Satan staid not to reply But glad that now his Sea should find a shore With fresh alacritie and force renewd Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire Into the wilde expanse and through the shock Of fighting Elements on all sides round Environd wins his way harder beset And more endangerd then when Argo passd Through Bosporus betwixt the justling Rocks Or when Ulysses on the Larbord shunnd Charybdis and by th other whirlpool steard  So he with difficulty and labour hard Movd on with difficulty and labour hee But hee once past soon after when man fell Strange alteration   Sin and Death amain Following his track such was the will of Heavn Pavd after him a broad and beatn way Over the dark Abyss whose boiling Gulf Tamely endurd a Bridge of wondrous length From Hell continud reaching th utmost Orbe Of this frail World by which the Spirits perverse With easie intercourse pass to and fro To tempt or punish mortals except whom God and good Angels guard by special grace  But now at last the sacred influence Of light appears and from the walls of Heavn Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night A glimmering dawn here Nature first begins Her fardest verge and Chaos to retire As from her outmost works a brokd foe With tumult less and with less hostile din That Satan with less toil and now with ease Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds Gladly the Port though Shrouds and Tackle torn Or in the emptier waste resembling Air Weighs his spread wings at leasure to behold Farr off th Empyreal Heavn extended wide In circuit undetermind square or round With Opal Towrs and Battlements adornd Of living Saphire once his native Seat And fast by hanging in a golden Chain This pendant world in bigness as a Starr Of smallest Magnitude close
