Sweet is the dew that falls betimesAnd drops upon the leafy limes
   Sweet Hermons fragrant airSweet is the lilys silver bellAnd sweet the wakeful tapers smell
   That watch for early prayr 
 Sweet the young nurse with love intenseWhich smiles oer sleeping innocence
   Sweet when the lost arriveSweet the musicians ardour beatsWhile his vague minds in quest of sweets
   The choicest flowrs to hive 
 Sweeter in all the strains of loveThe language of thy turtle dove
   Paird to thy swelling chordSweeter with evry grace endudThe glory of thy gratitude
   Respird unto the Lord 
 Strong is the horse upon his speedStrong in pursuit the rapid glede
   Which makes at once his gameStrong the tall ostrich on the groundStrong thro the turbulent profound
   Shoots xiphias to his aim 
 Strong is the lion like a coalHis eye-ball like a bastions mole
   His chest against the foesStrong the gier-eagle on his sailStrong against tide th enormous whale
   Emerges as he goes 
 But stronger still in earth and airAnd in the sea the man of prayr
   And far beneath the tideAnd in the seat to faith assigndWhere ask is have where seek is findWhere knock is open wide 
 Beauteous the fleet before the galeBeauteous the multitudes in mail
   Rankd arms and crested headsBeauteous the gardens umbrage mildWalk water meditated wild
   And all the bloomy beds 
 Beauteous the moon full on the lawnAnd beauteous when the veils withdrawn
   The virgin to her spouseBeauteous the temple deckd and filldWhen to the heavn of heavns they build
   Their heart-directed vows 
 Beauteous yea beauteous more than theseThe shepherd king upon his knees
   For his momentous trustWith wish of infinite conceitFor man beast mute the small and great
   And prostrate dust to dust 
 Precious the bounteous widows miteAnd precious for extreme delight
   The largess from the churlPrecious the rubys blushing blazeAnd albas blest imperial rays
   And pure cerulean pearl 
 Precious the penitential tearAnd precious is the sigh sincere
   Acceptable to GodAnd precious are the winning flowrsIn gladsome Israels feast of bowrs
   Bound on the hallowd sod 
 More precious that diviner partOf David evn the Lords own heart
   Great beautiful and newIn all things where it was intentIn all extremes in each event
   Proof answring true to true 
 Glorious the sun in mid careerGlorious th assembled fires appear
   Glorious the comets trainGlorious the trumpet and alarmGlorious th almighty stretchd-out arm
   Glorious th enrapturd main
 Glorious the northern lights a-streamGlorious the song when Gods the theme
   Glorious the thunders roarGlorious hosanna from the denGlorious the catholic amen
   Glorious the martyrs gore
 Glorious more glorious is the crownOf Him that brought salvation down
   By meekness calld thy SonThou that stupendous truth believdAnd now the matchless deeds achievd
   Determind dard and done
