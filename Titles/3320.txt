
Inside the night this hospital asylum
this party for those undone by desire forever
unslaked inside a house inside the night
Im inside
this house with eight beams and moonlight
pulling on the past through skylights this house
of white noise wind and dry heat lonely
house on a ridge line house of ordinary
shame
my sisters house with corrals and outbuildings
around it and beyond that the dog
patrolling and beyond that skirts and folds
of the mountain rising in rumpled geologic
scrolls into the range 
At the center
beneath the moons silence that nothing
ever changes muffled in blankets with fear
beside me on my little bench of sleep
I can hear their voices
could be three or twenty-three
unhinged saints gabbling to their shadows
or panty-sniffers drug-trippers in all flavors
past vanilla could be Birnam wood
on the move the shriek of its roots thirsty
and air-brushed or a pack of lunatics
crooning norteño songs 
What is certain is advent 
Theyre coming down
                             coming towards
the heart beneath the feathers
coming for
what cant be protected
on a beam of dread
riding that ray 
Im listening my eyes snapped-open
inside darkness other people in other rooms
who know how to sleep through a night
like this night thrown against the roundness
of the world which is desire 
The old bitch guards this night on the ranch
half shepherd half other this is her watch
she gallops the perimeter anxious to sound like
more than one dog though shes going arthritic
and her paws strike the hard ground 
Now they quiet penitents lunatics
marauders and ragpickers quiet 
Only one left behind and the moon
                           is his hieroglyph
one creature padding
                down the mountain
coming closer 
Coyote knows a good joke
he only wants to let her in on it 
He cant stop laughing cant stop
crying cant stop licking the crevices
clean licking safety and duty
until theyre empty 
I hear the dog listening ears lifted 
Coyotes tongue slides into night
air pressing narcotic vowels throughwonder through longing
and longing and wonder awaken  Shes close
to that edge that border in the night
where one thing becomes another and even
an old dog whos worked a ranch eleven years
feels the urge to let loose blow this little
settlement go wild 
Clouds loose and blue in the arms
of the moon slant light on this mountain raking
us the dog and I we feel the pull  Imagine
a woman trying to come between
coyote and the female hes after
when she knows
what is dark and offers itself and vanishes
has come for her at last The body wants
what it cant have to follow the path
of thirst through the rent in the wire
beyond the corral 
The dog doesnt move but who knows
better than she the small outpost
death has set up in her maybe shes all
desire now to slip under the moon
and chase down that lure 
Coyote wheedles and croons another minute
or two then lopes off calling over his shoulder
in a language even I can understand
the right names for thingsnot kept in heaven
