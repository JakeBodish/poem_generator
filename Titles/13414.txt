
There are four men mowing down by the Isar I can hear the swish of the scythe-strokes four Sharp breaths taken yea and I Am sorry for whats in store  The first man out of the four thats mowing Is mine I claim him once and for all Though its sorry I am on his young feet knowing None of the trouble hes led to stall  As he sees me bringing the dinner he lifts His head as proud as a deer that looks Shoulder-deep out of the corn and wipes His scythe-blade bright unhooks The scythe-stone and over the stubble to me  Lad thou hast gotten a child in me Laddie a man thoult hae to be Yea though Im sorry for thee
