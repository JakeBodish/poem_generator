ocotepeque h n  I was born in a little town  This was not very long ago  I think I was four five years old  Parents let me do whatever I looked up at the sun I loved the sun it burned a dot in my eyes  Mom was saying we must go catch the bus soon instead I grabbed a piece of wood  etched it  Sucked it like my own thumb to learn something no one else had  Don’t judge my face  Girls like me  Boys like me with my long hair I relish it  I love my father very much  More than anybody  He stayed  One morning I come home  He isn’t there  Down the road this crowd  I drive the crowd away  This is my father I say  Ask them this thing they allow his body given to me  I dissect it  Anatomy my father taught me
