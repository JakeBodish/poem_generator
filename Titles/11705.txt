
Do me my elegy now or Ill scrawl the thing I scrawl as youre going or screw in a ball when youre gone Or you and I write unaware in each others tongue That you or I ever set foot       Or do what our son Andor little daughter got done got our brilliant names Pricily grooved in marble by one skilled In times of loss dream iridescent dreams Its that first Saturday  Let this hour be filled With anything but the case so that Time the clerk Goes panting in horror from gremlin to error to glitch And his screen is stripes and he knows he saved his work In one of a billion files but fuck knows which And he lets us alone or at worst as we tiptoe by Feels were familiar cant for the world say why
