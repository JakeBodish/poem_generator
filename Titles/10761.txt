
Even at my favorite coffeeshop downtown Redford
is a hard man to feed  This morning he picks
at his Grilled Asiago Mastercrust with a slow disdainful frown Could they spare the fromage on this so-called treat
He takes a sip of hazelnut coffee then winces delicately
into the neck of his sweater vest  I bite powerfully
through my Cinnamon Frenchroll Well if you really dont think
you got enough fromage you should just go back up there
 tell the girl
