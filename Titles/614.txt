Let it be the dream it used to be 
Let it be the pioneer on the plain
Seeking a home where he himself is free 
 
America never was America to me 
 
Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed 
Let it be that great strong land of love
Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme
That any man be crushed by one above 
 
It never was America to me 
 
O let my land be a land where Liberty
Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath
But opportunity is real and life is free
Equality is in the air we breathe 
 
Theres never been equality for me
Nor freedom in this homeland of the free 
 Say who are you that mumbles in the dark
And who are you that draws your veil across the stars
