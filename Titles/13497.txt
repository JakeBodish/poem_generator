
How long it must have been the girl’s hair
       cascading down her shoulders almost to her waist   
               light brown and heavy as brocade the story I’m
remembering of N’s remembering as my own   
       hair’s washed and cut the salt-and-pepper   
               cuneiform to frill my barber’s smock 
Arts and Science is expanding  The wall
       to the empty shop next door pulled down   
               and a dozen workmen slink improbably
on scaffolds butting the dusty ceiling   
       cacophony and plastic tarps the whirr
               of drills that mingles with the dryers’
jittery hums the scissors’ flash
       veronicas of clicks the coloring the curling   
               the antique cash register
melodious with its chime  And best
       the liquid gurgle of hands massaging scalps   
               the row of sinks twelve hands and six
wet scalps in a line  I’m next and leaning back          let me wash it in this big tin basin   
               battered and shiny like the moon
