Deep in a vale a stranger now to armsToo poor to shine in courts too proud to begHe who once warred on Saratoga’s plainsSits musing o’er his scars and wooden leg  Remembering still the toil of former daysTo other hands he sees his earnings paid--They share the due reward he feeds on praise Lost in the abyss of want misfortune’s shade  Far far from domes where splendid tapers glare‘Tis his from dear bought peace no wealth to winRemoved alike from courtly cringing ‘squiresThe great-man’s Levee and the proud man’s grin  Sold are those arms which once on Britons blazedWhen flushed with conquest to the charge they cameThat power repelled and Freedom’s fabrick raisedShe leaves her soldier famine and a name
