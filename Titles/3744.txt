
Its not about the sex really its not
the ache of the bruised nipple or the burn
left by his two-day-old beard in the crook
of my neck where the pulse is taken its
his breathing when asleep that draws me near 
When I was seventeen Id check beside me
hope I hadnt rolled and squashed flat
my one-year-old brother  His sigh on my ear
the rise and fall of air beneath his ribs
was a miracle to me  The nightly
surprise of what I saw under the bulbs
dim glow I saw the small heart beating
like wings unfolding in the body  Here
with this man ideas of flight return
