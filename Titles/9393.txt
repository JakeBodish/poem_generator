
He gossips like my grandmother this man
with my face and I could stand
amused all afternoon
in the Hon Kee Grocery
amid hanging meats he
chops roast pork cut
from a hog hung
by nose and shoulders
her entire skin burnt
crisp flesh I know
to be sweet
her shining
face grinning
up at ducks
dangling single file
each pierced by black
hooks through breast bill
and steaming from a hole
stitched shut at the ass 
I step to the counter recite
and he without even slightly
varying the rhythm of his current confession or harangue
scribbles my order on a greasy receipt
and chops it up quick 
Such a sorrowful Chinese face
nomad Gobi Northern
in its boniness
clear from the high
warlike forehead
to the sheer edge of the jaw 
He could be my brother but finer
and except for his left forearm which is engorged
sinewy from his daily grip and
wield of a two-pound tool
hes delicate narrow-
waisted his frame
so slight a lover some
rough other
might break it down
its smooth oily length 
In his light-handed calligraphy
on receipts and in his
moodiness he is
a Southerner from a river-province
suited for scholarship his face poised
above an open book he’d mumble
his favorite passages 
He could be my grandfather
come to America to get a Western education
in 1917 but too homesick to study
he sits in the park all day reading poems
and writing letters to his mother 
He lops the head off chops
the neck of the duck
into six slits
the body
open groin
to breast and drains
the scalding juices
then quarters the carcass
with two fast hacks of the cleaver
old blade that has worn
into the surface of the round
foot-thick chop-block
a scoop that cradles precisely the curved steel 
The head flung from the body opens
down the middle where the butcher
cleanly halved it between
the eyes and I
see foetal-crouched
inside the skull the homunculus
gray brain grainy
to eat 
Did this animal after all at the moment
its neck broke
image the way his executioner
shrinks from his own death
Is this how
I too recoil from my day
See how this shape
hordes itself see how
little it is 
See its grease on the blade 
Is this how I’ll be found
when judgement is passed when names
are called when crimes are tallied
This is also how I looked before I tore my mother open 
Is this how I presided over my century is this how
I regarded the murders
This is also how I prayed 
Was it me in the Other
I prayed to when I prayed
This too was how I slept clutching my wife 
Was it me in the other I loved
when I loved another
The butcher sees me eye this delicacy 
With a finger he picks it
out of the skull-cradle
and offers it to me 
I take it gingerly between my fingers
and suck it down 
I eat my man 
The noise the body makes
when the body meets
the soul over the soul’s ocean and penumbra
is the old sound of up-and-down in-and-out
a lump of muscle chug-chugging blood
into the ear a lover’s
heart-shaped tongue
flesh rocking flesh until flesh comes
the butcher working
at his block and blade to marry their shapes
by violence and time
an engine crossing
re-crossing salt water hauling
immigrants and the junk
of the poor  These
are the faces I love the bodies
and scents of bodies
for which I long
in various ways at various times
thirteen gathered around the redwood
happy talkative voracious
at day’s end
eager to eat
four kinds of meat
prepared four different ways
numerous plates and bowls of rice and vegetables
each made by distinct affections
and brought to table by many hands 
Brothers and sisters by blood and design
who sit in separate bodies of varied shapes
we constitute a many-membered
body of love 
In a world of shapes
of my desires each one here
is a shape of one of my desires and each
is known to me and dear by virtue
of each one’s unique corruption
of those texts the face the body
that jut jaw
to gnash tendon
that wide nose to meet the blows
a face like that invites
those long eyes closing on the seen
those thick lips
to suck the meat of animals
or recite 300 poems of the T’ang
these teeth to bite my monosyllables
these cheekbones to make
those syllables sing the soul 
Puffed or sunken
according to the life
dark or light according
to the birth straight
or humped whole manqué quasi each pleases verging
on utter grotesquery 
All are beautiful by variety 
The soul too
is a debasement
of a text but thus it
acquires salience although a
human salience but
inimitable and hence memorable 
God is the text 
The soul is a corruption
and a mnemonic 
A bright moment
I hold up an old head
from the sea and admire the haughty
down-curved mouth
that seems to disdain
all the eyes are blind to
including me the eater 
Whole unto itself complete
without me yet its
shape complements the shape of my mind 
I take it as text and evidence
of the world’s love for me
and I feel urged to utterance
urged to read the body of the world urged
to say it
in human terms
my reading a kind of eating my eating
a kind of reading
my saying a diminishment my noise
a love-in-answer 
What is it in me would
devour the world to utter it
What is it in me will not let
the world be would eat
not just this fish
but the one who killed it
the butcher who cleaned it 
I would eat the way he
squats the way he
reaches into the plastic tubs
and pulls out a fish clubs it takes it
to the sink guts it drops it on the weighing pan 
I would eat that thrash
and plunge of the watery body
in the water that liquid violence
between the man’s hands
I would eat
the gutless twitching on the scales
three pounds of dumb
nerve and pulse I would eat it all
to utter it 
The deaths at the sinks those bodies prepared
for eating I would eat
and the standing deaths
at the counters in the aisles
the walking deaths in the streets
the death-far-from-home the death-
in-a-strange-land these Chinatown
deaths these American deaths 
I would devour this race to sing it
this race that according to Emersonmanaged to preserve to a hair
for three or four thousand years
the ugliest features in the world
