Say one Spaceman when she lands will touch
down in a human sentence speaking Dutch
a dialect of Mentalese  Her torch-
songs loosely rendered from the Arcturan “Baby
Let’s Get Square with Pi” or “You’re the Apple
of My Eye” or “Boola Theta Babel
Bye-Bye ” It might make sense  This is a heady
thought  The traditional verse viz  “Who’s Your Daddy”
as sung in The War of the Worlds and signaled Maydaymayday a little like Beethoven’s 4th in digital
redaction may underpin what limbic Dutch
must once upon a time have bloomed beneath the sagittal
crest of Homo Who What This news just in the starry
sky is empty  Spacemen are out  Sorry 
2  exo-statisticians change minds cite insufficiency of planetary bodies of right type
What no aliens Or with greater dignitylife elsewhere in the universe That window’s
shut we learn  Astronomers indignant
desert birds eyes screwed to the long cinder-
scuttles of their telescopes will voice some doubt
one hopes This is too lonely  Heliocentric
humility’s a habit hard to shake  Endowed
with what we’ve called “intelligence” or “powerful
intelligence” like-minded creatures each an end-
point in a home-world’s evolutionary raffle
well just must across the vasty deeps of space
and time yearn forth to find each other with awful
big radios  That’s how the Book of Revelations
we knew used to read rephrased so pi be praised

My friend the geometer when asked if pi
were in the sky or in the skull replied
pi’s the pontification of a ratio 
Bisected so the circle pi  To show
that in a well-formed sentence well that’s human sure 
All language is  So ever since that fateful shore
of Lake Turkana where tongue forked where first
flaking syntax split the atom into force
and mass thing and verb the copula
has groped to reanneal it this opulence
is equal to the sum of those simplicities    
So here’s the mystery across the placid
surface of the water a salt of stars

stars  Then Look look up at the stars

Hold it there 
Would you say truth’s a property of sentences but beauty’s not
So that mysterious predictive gift of mathematics is precisely that of  sentences like I predict the sun will rise tomorrow isn’t that the leap that left the chimpanzees behind and adding time of sunrise just adds  increment to the precision
So that Platonic realm where Mathematics must exist to be discovered by Ramanujan or Hardy or Arcturans tucked in anywhere in time or space is just that space where earlier equations live like love’s a rose or tears are rain which Hardy’s and Ramanujan’s respective ancestors discovered independently
That if in England two men feed a horse the horse stays thin the axiom would hold as well for two Tibetan yaks or fat Jurassic stegosaurs assuming less that that’s what the Arcturans use to carry mail than that like us they pinch their pence 
That that’s the realm where poems and equations likewise lie unspoken  quietly awaiting their discovery
And so those famous instances where mathematics efflorescing on some blackboard purely for the play of it turn out to have a shocking congruence with patterns in the world is just exactly like the case where poetry is news before the news it stays
That hadn’t the acclaimed predictive potency of mathematics best be cast as a reminder of forgotten shock the shock our shaggy kind must once have felt framing for the first time well-formed sentences about the world that was and then about the world about to be and so extended human sensibility  and thrust it forth as backward through the night of time

5  postscriptum
The aliens are back incidentally  Astral
systems dropping planets like nuts in May  Exo-
biology leaps again into likelihood  A straw
poll proves the numbers may be multiplex 
No small relief for this slow versifier
who peering through this poem’s decades-long zoom-
lens has seen what changes sapphire
heaven bleached of all biology shazam 
and then revivified less abruptly
with a thought  In the same blink of the clock
the pupil of a black hole was seen to matter
some dinosaurs grew feathers and this one for Ripley’s
Pluto got demoted from a planet to a rock 
Also my family died  Also I had a daughter
