
Come March we’d find them In the five-and-dimes Furled tighter than umbrellas About their slats the airIn an undertow above usLike weather on the maps  We’d play out linesOf kite string tugging againstThe bucking sideways flights  Readied for assemblyI’d arc the tensed keel of balsa Into place against the crosspieceFeeling the paper snap  Tautly as a sheet then lift The almost weightless body Up to where it hauled meTrolling into the winds  Knotted bows like vertebrae Flashing among fieldsOf light  Why ruin itBy recalling the aftermaths Kites gone down in tatters Kites fraying like flotsam From the tops of the trees
