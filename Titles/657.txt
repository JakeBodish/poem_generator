
Not long after you had told me gently
that you still grieved for your last love
though that had ended almost a year before
and that you could have no intimate relationship
with me maybe not with anyone for a time
I stopped my fork in the air with whatever hung
on the end of it that I was eating 
My throat wouldnt swallow 
I felt weak and sick as if it were myself
that I devoured piece by piece as you talked away
the hopes that I had put in your lovely face 
It was the old story coming true for me once more
though you were hardly mine       
When we finished I walked you back to your car
I dont remember having much to say 
Why would I Buildings drifted by
and cars and faces  Then we arrived at the place
where afterwards I would never see you again
at a parking lot near Times Square 
There I marked the sidewalk with Xs
visible only to me At this place
I was lost again theyd say to me
when I walked there in the future 
Dig here and find whats left of me
or what I left behind where X marks the spot 
I felt like the deaths-head and crossed bones
that surmount the treasure chest 
I only felt a little like gold coins and jewels 
I have signed the City with these sphinxes
 in parks in streets in bedrooms
in my own apartments  And there we stood
you and I hemmed in by the stitches of Xs
that could not hold you to me  But Xs
mean kisses I realized as well as
what is lost all the kisses I couldnt give you
chalked like symbols on the sidewalk 
After all you yourself had been marked
by loss even in your laughter that afternoon
at the show I had taken you to  Bright-eyed
and smiling in the seat beside me you
stole my glances with your dark dark eyes
and your long hair  I thought that I had not been
this happy in a long time with a woman
and was ready to become even more happy
ready to do anything that you wanted
in order to please you to see that smile come up
not knowing what you were soon to say to me
as we dined  And when you spoke
I felt life fall away from me  Again I felt
that I would never be happy  I felt the words
that I had wanted to say to you leaving me rushing
out of my chest like dead air until I had no more words
to say  I seemed to cut and swallow my food
as if it were me myself that stuck in pieces
on the end of the fork I had raised to my mouth 
Had I been chewing on my own flesh
Self-Pity the Devourer took me by the hand
that held the fork and once again I feasted
on all that was dark and hopeless in myself
in lieu of all that was beautiful desirable
and unattainable in you  And then
I stood beside you in the lot where you
had parked your car with the Xs buzzing
in the air sticking themselves to you
and me and the blacktop and the cars 
When you reached out to embrace me I
moved to embrace you in return and then came
the part that I dont want to remember
the part I hate I caught a glimpse of your
face as we put our arms around each other
and your face said everything to me about
how you had wasted the afternoon how eager
you were to speed away in your car a mixture
of disgust and relief that the thing would soon
be over that I would be crossed out forever
from your life and everything that I hated
about myself my stupid chin my ugly nose
my hopeless balded head my stuck-out ears
my wreck of a heart crashed over me
spinning me into the vortex of a palpable self-hate
that I have only ever let myself feel
a little bit at a time though it is always there
