If  leaf-trash chokes the stream-bedreach for rock-bottom as you rakethe muck out  Let it slump dankand dry fading flat above the bank Stand back  Watch the water vault ahead Its thrust sweeps the surface clean shores the debrisas it debrides its stone path to the lakeclarity carrying clarity To see clear resist the drag of  images Take nature as it is not Dame nor Kind Act in events touch what you name  Abhoreasy obverts of natural metaphor Let human speech breathe out its best poor bridgesfrom mind to world mind to self mind to mind Yet I admit the event of the wood thrush     In a footnote Langer her book rapids-clean     like the spring-water aired over sleeked rock     says she witnessed an August bird in shock     when a hawk snatched its mate  It perched rushed     notes fluting two life-quotas in one flood     its lungs pushing its voice flushing the keen     calls pumped out as the heart pumps blood     not in twilight or warning but noon  wrong     its old notes whistled too fast but accurate I read this drenched in bird-panic its spine-fusing loss all song all loss that loss mineawash in unanswered unanswered song And I cannot claim we are not desolate
