
Some folks fool themselves into believing
But I know what I know once at the height
Of hopeless touching my man and I holdOur breaths certain we can stop time or maybeEliminate it from our lives which are shorter Since we learned to make love for each other Rather than doing it to each other  As for praise And worship I prefer the latter  Only memoryMakes us kneel silent and still  Hear me Thunder scares  Lightning lets us see  Then Heads covered we wait for rain  Dear Lord Let me watch for his arrival and hang my headAnd shake it like a man whos lost and lived  Something keeps trying but Im not killed yet
