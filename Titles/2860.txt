First a black mark in the sky
                a speck that grows
into a plane widening
                dramatically circling
before it touches
                a gray strip of land
designed for its landing 
Then the players descend
                the wheeled stair
to the stage
                 for the cameras
our collective eye
                first her then him
as is custom
                and their entourage
trailing behind
                those who believe
the world is young
                and the future spreads
out like geography 
Its the beginning
                of all that
                and what a show it is
the bouquet of roses
            we see given to her
on the scratchy screen
the film pouring its light
                edges burned 
And who knows whats truth
               whats myth
or if they arrive
                as hawks or doves
brave with risk
                in a bright and swirling
land where the dust
seems to crown
               from its own gray dust 
Heres the raw footage 
        Heres the film
clicking in the projector
and as all things seen
                through it
                are black and white
isnt it important to note
                her roses are red
and not yellow
                and that neither of them
squints in the bright Texas sun
If you can stand
                what the light inside
the darkness does
                 to your eyes
                 watch them pause there
for a moment
                 our champion our grace
in that high noon
                 that holds all
the freshness of the morning
