
A clear choice
is so sweet  Not
reluctance butreal resistance 
Joy-to-bursting
or none Grief
not gradations 
Someone essential
and someone not 
A good dark
strike-through
versus
weighing everything
at the end of each day 
Look a cat killed a cardinal
on an emerald lawn 
For so many reasons
it shouldnt have been
beautiful 
But thats also
the kind of book
I like best
