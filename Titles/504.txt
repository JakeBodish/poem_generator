
More than a hundred dollars of them 
 
It was pure folly  I had to find more glass things to stuff
        them in 
 
Now a white and purple cloud is breathing in each corner
 
of the room I love  Now a mass of flowers spills down my
        dining table 
 
each fresh-faced extending delicate leaves
 
into the crush  Didnt I watch
 
children shuffle strictly in line cradle
 
candles that dribbled hot white on their fingers
 
chanting Latin just to fashion Sevillas Easter Wasnt I sad
        Didnt I use to
 
go mucking through streambeds with the skunk cabbage
        raising
 
bursting violet spears Look the afternoon dies
 
as night begins in the heart of the lilies and smokes up
 
their fluted throats until it fills the room
 
and my lights have to be not switched on 
 
And in close darkness the aroma grows so sweet
 
so strong that it could slice me open  It does 
 
I know Im not the only one whose life is a conditional clause
 
hanging from something to do with spring and one tall room
        and the tremble of my phone 
 
Im not the only one that love makes feel like a dozen
 
flapping bedsheets being ripped to prayer flags by the wind 
 
When I stand in full sun I feel I have been falling headfirst for
        decades 
 
God I am so transparent 
 
So light
