
ROXANA from the court retiring lateSighd her soft sorrows at St  JAMESs gateSuch heavy thoughts lay brooding in her breastNot her own chairmen wth more weight opprestThey groan the cruel load theyre doomd to bear She in these gentler sounds expressd her care  Was it for this that I these Roses wear For this new-set my Jewels for my hair  Ah  Princess  with what zeal have I pursud  Almost forgot the duty of a Prude  Thinking I never coud attend too soon Ive missd my prayers to get me dressd by noon  For Thee ah  what for Thee did I resign  My Pleasures Passions all that eer was mine  I sacrificd both Modesty and Ease Left Operas and went to filthy Plays  Double entendres shockd my tender ear Yet even this for Thee I chose to bear  In glowing youth when nature bids be gay And evry joy of life before me lay By honour prompted and by pride restraind The pleasures of the young my soul disdaind  Sermons I sought and with a mien severe Censurd my neighbours and said daily prayr  Alas  how changd   with the same sermon mien  That once I prayd the What-dye callt Ive seen  Ah  cruel Princess for thy sake Ive lost That reputation which so dear had cost  I who avoided evry publick place When bloom and beauty bid me show my face  Now near Thee constant evry night abide With never-failing duty by thy side Myself and daughters standing on a row To all the foreigners a goodly show  Oft had your drawing-room been sadly thin And merchants wives close by the chair had been seen  Had not I amply filld the empty space And savd your Highness from the dire disgrace  Yet COQUETILLAs artifice prevails When all my merit and my duty fails  That COQUETILLA whose deluding airs Corrupts our virgins and our youth ensnares  So sunk her character so lost her fame Scarce visited before your Highness came  Yet for the Bed-chamber tis Her you chuse When Zeal and Fame and Virtue you refuse  Ah  worthy choice  not one of all your train Whom censure blasts not and dishonours stain  Let the nice hind now suckle dirty pigs And the proud pea-hen snatch the cuckoos eggs  Let IRIS leave her paint and own her age And grave SUFFOLKIA wed a giddy page  A greater miracle is daily viewd A virtuous Princess with a court so lewd  I know thee Court  with all thy treachrous wiles Thy false caresses and undoing smiles  Ah  Princess learnd in all the courtly arts To cheat our hopes and yet to gain our hearts  Large lovely bribes are the great statesmans aim  And the neglected patriot follows fame  The Prince is ogled  some the King pursue  But your ROXANA only follows YOU  Despisd ROXANA cease and try to find Some other since the Princess proves unkind  Perhaps it is not hard to find at court If not a greater a more firm support
