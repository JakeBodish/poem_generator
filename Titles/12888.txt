
There is a drear and lonely tract of hellFrom all the common gloom removed afarA flat sad land it is where shadows areWhose lorn estate my verse may never tell I walked among them and I knew them wellMen I had slandered on lifes little starFor churls and sluggards and I knew the scarUpon their brows of woe ineffable But as I went majestic on my wayInto the dark they vanished one by oneTill with a shaft of Gods eternal dayThe dream of all my glory was undone And with a fools importunate dismayI heard the dead men singing in the sun
