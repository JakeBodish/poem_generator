O Mistress mine where are you roaming O stay and hear your true loves coming       That can sing both high and low  Trip no further pretty sweeting  Journeys end in lovers meeting       Every wise mans son doth know  What is love tis not hereafter Present mirth hath present laughter       Whats to come is still unsure  In delay there lies no plenty Then come kiss me sweet and twenty       Youths a stuff will not endure
