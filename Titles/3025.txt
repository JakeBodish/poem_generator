Is power the enemy Destroyer
of dawns cool flesh of valentines among
the radios pauses drunks
of the 19th century  I see it

dead from heat exhaustion
                                                   at the beach

to those speedy heroines of masturbation or kicking literal evil
continually down filmy public stairs
