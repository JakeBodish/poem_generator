
The red eyes of rabbits   
arent sad  No one passes
the sad golden village in a barge
any more  The sunset   
will leave it alone  If the   
curtains hang askew   
it is no ones fault 
Around and around and around
everywhere the same sound   
of wheels going and things   
growing older growing   
silent  If the dogs
bark to each other
all night and their eyes   
flash red thats
nobodys business  They have   
a great space of dark to   
bark across  The rabbits   
will bare their teeth at   
the spring moon
