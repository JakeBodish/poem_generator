of  them wives     some of them             with
plumes of  smoke for husbands    all    lonely
smelling of  onions  milk         all mothers
some of them to children some to old names
phantom girls acting out a life        only half
a life away      instead        copper kitchenware
bangles pushed up the arm    fingernails rusted
with henna          kneading raw meat with salt
with coriander                     sweating upper lip
in the steam       weak tea          hair unwound
against the nape         my deities      each one
sandal slapping against stone heel      sandal-
wood  oud                    bright chiffon spun
about each head     coffee in the dowry china
butter biscuits on a painted plate      crumbs
suspended in eggshell demitasse        they
begin                  i heard       people are sayingi saw it with my own eyes             ’s daughtera scandal                  she was wearing
