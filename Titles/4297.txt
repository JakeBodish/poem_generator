The ovaries when splayed resemblesliced tomatoes  Or rose windows
each geometry precise enoughto praise  I want to press my tongue
against the bloodroot petal to runits stamen along my slick shelf of
teeth like a man might with a wheat stalk Four times so far other tourists
have taken me for a galleryattendant  In the glass a slow-
sidling crimson spreads over my ownskewed reflection a hesitant
teen in a Harvard hoodie the fifthleans in to ask Excuse me sirAre they really glass   a testamentto how my binder encases
my breasts my faith in the plum yew’s fruit-shorn frenzy  Dense clusters teeming
with their separate blossoms anyunknowing eye might think they were
living  But I know the lilac’s telltwo blemishes bulbous where some
hot glass mis-dripped then caught foreverin the filament  Sometimes I think
I’ll wake to find they’ve finallytrickled off me in the night pooled
molten down the bed and gatheredback again  I might thrash off both breasts
in a sleepless fit or could unfurlmy clit like a pollen basket passed
from a honeybee’s hind legsto the hive  It makes its secret
seen  I can only answer yes  YesThey’re real  I mean they’re really glass 
You could snap a stem between fingerswith such a slight force one stark blink   
the flies flitting the gallery would fearthe weight of their own landing
thick wings rapt still  When the publicin their distressed astonishment
demanded to know how the Blaschkastransported the models without
a fracture in even one pistilLeopold Blaschka revealed his own
elaborate process pack eachflower tightly in its cardboard
cradle then strap them down with strong wireto restrict movement and set each at last
in a wooden box wrapped with burlap They drove them straight from Manhattan
in two hearses  The drivers of coursewore black suits  Onlookers parted
to allow their small procession past I like it here with everyone
focused on the flowers  Hunched kneelingas if suspicious still doubting
the teen eyes two tiny zinniasthen moves on to another case 
I’ve seen many leave unsatisfied They can’t bear to be partitioned   
how can I blame them Someone made thesewith their body  They let their breath
unspool to form each impossiblebud crafted every flower’s fold
then waited on the heat to break tohold just one wearing special gloves 
Wouldn’t anyone wish for just one lieamong a garden this precise
One daisy swapped out in secret switchedwith a common courtyard flower
now waiting for someone to noticeits wilt while its counterparts keep
all their glisten  It does seem to metrue punishment never to change 
Unflinching forever  Sometimes nearclosing when the hall becomes quiet
I really do believe they’re real
