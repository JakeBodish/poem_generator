
It’s a spring morning sun pours in the window
As I sit here drinking coffee reading Augustine 
And finding him as always newly minted
From when I first encountered him in school 
Today I’m overcome with astonishment
At the way we girls denied all that was mean
In those revered philosophers we studied
Who found us loathsome loathsomely seductive
Irrelevant at best to noble discourse
Among the sex the only sex that counted 
Wounded we pretended not to mind it
And wore tight sweaters to tease our shy professor 
We sat in autumn sunshine “as the clouds arose
From slimy desires of the flesh and from
Youth’s seething spring ” Thank you Augustine 
Attempting to seem blasé our cheeks on fire
It didn’t occur to us to rush from the room 
Instead we brushed aside “the briars of unclean desire”
And struggled on through mires of misogyny
Till we arrived at Kierkegaard and began to see
That though Saint A  and Søren had much in common
Including fear and trembling before women
The Saint scared himself while Søren was scared of us 
Had we poor girls been flattered by their thralldom
Yes it was always us the rejected feminine
From whom temptation came  It was our flesh
With its deadly sweetness that led them on 
Yet how could we not treasure Augustine
“Stuck fast in the bird-lime of pleasure”
That roomful of adolescent poets manqué
Assuaged bemused by music let the meaning go 
Swept by those psalmic cadences we were seduced
Some of us tried for a while to be well-trained souls
And pious seekers enmeshed in the Saint’s dialecticResponsible for our actions yet utterly helpless 
A sensible girl would have barked like a dog before God 
We students children still were shocked to learn
The children these men desired were younger than we
Augustine fancied a girl about eleven
The age of Adeodatus Augustine’s son 
Søren like Poe eyed his girl before she was sixteen
To impose his will on a malleable child when
She was not equipped to withstand or understand him 
Ah the Pygmalion instinct Mold the clay
Create the compliant doll that can only obey
Expecting to be abandoned minute by minute 
It was then I abandoned philosophy
A minor loss although I majored in it 
But we were a group of sunny innocents 
I don’t believe we knew what evil meant 
Now I live with a well-trained soul who deals with evil
Including error material or spiritual
Easily like changing a lock on the kitchen door 
He prays at set times and in chosen places
At meals in church while I
Pray without thinking how or when to pray
In a low mumble several times a day
Like running a continuous low fever
The sexual impulse for the most part being over 
Believing I believe  Not banking on it ever 
It’s afternoon  I sit here drinking kir
And reading Kierkegaard “All sin begins with fear ”
True  We lie first from terror of our parents 
In I believe an oblique crack at Augustine
Søren said by denying the erotic
It was brought to the attention of the world 
The rainbow curtain rises on the sensual
Christians must admit it before they can deny it 
He reflected on his father’s fierce repression
Of the sexual which had bent him out of shape
Yet he had to pay obeisance to that power
He chose his father when he broke with his Regina Søren said by denying the erotic
It is brought to the attention of the world 
You must admit it before you can deny it
