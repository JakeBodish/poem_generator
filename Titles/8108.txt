
It appeared inside our classroom
at a quarter after ten
it gobbled up the blackboard
three erasers and a pen 
It gobbled teachers apple
and it bopped her with the core 
“How dare you” she responded 
“You must leave us       theres the door ”
The Creature didnt listen
but described an arabesque
as it gobbled all her pencils
seven notebooks and her desk 
Teacher stated very calmly
“Sir You simply cannot stay
Ill report you to the principal
unless you go away”
But the thing continued eating
it ate paper swallowed ink
as it gobbled up our homework
I believe I saw it wink 
Teacher finally lost her temper 
“OUT” she shouted at the creature 
The creature hopped beside her
and GLOPP       it gobbled teacher
