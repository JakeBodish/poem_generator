
Yes well gather by the river
the beautiful the beautiful river 
They say it runs by the throne of God 
This is where God invented fish 
Wherever but then Gods throne is as wide
as the universe  If youre attentive youll
see the thrones borders in the stars  Were on this side
and when you get to the other side we dont know
what will happen if anything  If nothing happens
we wont know it I said once  Is that cynical
No nothing is nothing not upsetting just
nothing  Then again maybe well be cast
at the speed of light through the universe
to Gods throne  His hair is bounteous 
All the 5000 birds on earth were created there 
The firstborn cranes herons hawks at the back
so as not to frighten the little ones 
Even now they remember this divine habitat 
Shall we gather at the river this beautiful river
Well sing with the warblers perched on his eyelashes
