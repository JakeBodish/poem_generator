
I never glimpse her but she goesWho had been basking in the sunHer links of chain mail one by oneAglint with pewter bronze and rose I never see her lying coiledAtop the garden step or underA dark leaf unless I blunderAnd by some motion she is foiled Too late I notice as she passesZither of chromatic scale I only ever see her tailQuicksilver into tall grasses I know her only by her flowingBy her glamour disappearingInto shadow as I’m nearing I only recognize her going
