
In a strange house
a strange bed
in a strange town
a very strange me
is waiting for you 
Now
it is very early in the morning 
The silence is loud 
The baby is walking about
with his foaming bottle
making strange sounds
and deciding after all
to be my friend 
You
arrive tonight 
How dull time is
How empty and yet
since I am sitting here
lying here
walking up and down here
waiting
I see
that times cruel ability
to make one wait
is times reality 
I see your hair
which I call red 
I lie here in this bed 
Someone teased me once
a friend of ours 
saying that I saw your hair red
because I was not thinking
of the hair on your head 
Someone also told me
a long time ago
my father said to meIt is a terrible thing
son
to fall into the hands of the living God
