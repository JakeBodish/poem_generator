You told me the son of Acton’s town nurse   
would never cross the border   
into Concord where the Revolution   
left great houses standing on Main Street    
Yet we crossed into Concord walking   
through Sleepy Hollow Cemetery   
to greet Thoreau his stone   
stamped with the word Henry
jutting like a gray thumbnail   
down the path from Emerson   
and his boulder of granite    
We remembered Henry’s night in jail   
refusing tax for the Mexican War   
and I could see you hunched with him   
loaning Henry a cigarette explaining
the perpetual wink of your eye   
lost after the windshield   
burst in your boyhood face    
When Emerson arrived
to ask what you and Henry
were doing in there you would sayYou got a song man sing it    
You got a bell man ring it
