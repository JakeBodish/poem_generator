The wave of that year
flooded the sands on the mirror
to be lost is a kind of leaving
and the meaning of leaving
the instant when all languages
are like shadows cast from the west
lifes only a promise
dont grieve for it
before the garden was destroyed
we had too much time
debating the implications of a bird flying
as we knocked down midnights door
alone like a match polished into light
when childhoods tunnel
led to a vein of dubious ore
to be lost is a kind of leaving
and poetry rectifying life
rectifies poetrys echo
