
In your arms was still delightQuiet as a street at nightAnd thoughts of you I do rememberWere green leaves in a darkened chamberWere dark clouds in a moonless sky Love in you went passing byPenetrative remote and rareLike a bird in the wide airAnd as the bird it left no traceIn the heaven of your face In your stupidity I foundThe sweet hush after a sweet sound All about you was the lightThat dims the greying end of nightDesire was the unrisen sunJoy the day not yet begunWith tree whispering to treeWithout wind quietly Wisdom slept within your hairAnd Long-Suffering was thereAnd in the flowing of your dressUndiscerning Tenderness And when you thought it seemed to meInfinitely and like a seaAbout the slight world you had knownYour vast unsconsciousness was thrown           O haven without wave or tideSilence in which all songs have diedHoly book where hearts are stillAnd home at length under the hillO mother quiet breasts of peaceWhere love itself would faint and ceaseO infinite deep I never knewI would come back come back to youFind you as a pool unstirredKneel down by you and never a wordLay my head and nothing saidIn your hands ungarlandedAnd a long watch you would keepAnd I should sleep and I should sleep
