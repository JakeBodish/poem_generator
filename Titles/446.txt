
When Heavy tells a story
the millwright shanty under the electric furnaces
chokes with quiet amid the roar
as Heavy pauses adjusts his mountainous weight
over a creaky grease-stained metal chair
and looks up at the whirling ceiling fan
next to fluorescent lights hanging by wires 
His fingers lace like so many sausages
across the canvas of blue workshirt
on his chest 
 
Heavy tells his story
and the voice of reason quickens the demise
of foulness from red-faced millwrights
just back from a repair job
and sitting around for the five air whistles
that again call them to combat on the furnace floor 
 
All laughter stops all nonsense sayings
and cuts of wisdom cease their echo
when Heavy tells a story 
 
Heavy talks about the Mexican melter
who once had an affair with the Pit Boss’s wife 
The heart of the problem–and the fact
from which the story’s plot revolves–
was that the melter lived across the street
from the Pit Boss 
One night just before the graveyard shift
the melter left his home kissed his wife’s
round face and proceeded to walk to the bus stop 
But a bullet pierced through his hardhat
and he fell like an overturned stack of fire bricks
onto the pavement 
The moral of this story
Never have an affair with someone
whose old man lives
within shooting distance 
 
Heavy tells a story
about a furnace foreman who always yelled
at the laborers for failing to clean
the bag house of the built-up filth
from hours of cooking scrap iron and ore 
The men told him it was too dangerous
to walk on the tin-roofed panels
their weight could cause
them to fall some 30 feet
into the gaping mouth of a flaming furnace below 
“Nonsense” the foreman yelled
“you’re all just lazy Polacks ”
he called everyone Polacks 
The foreman then proceeded to walk
across the roof as the men stood nearby
with mouths open near the safety of side beams 
“You see” he said standing in the middle
as hydraulics moved shutters
up and down to capture the sulphur dust 
 
Then the foreman moved forward
and before anyone could shout
he crashed through the roof
screaming into a reddened pot of molten metal
the oxygen in his body making popping sounds
as it entered  The furnace operates continued
to pour ladles of scrap iron and to melt the steel 
They skimmed the slag off the top
and when it was ready they poured
the molten mass into ingot molds 
There was nothing they could do for the foreman
they said  Production had to keep going 
 
Heavy looks into the eyes of his listeners and says
Somewhere there’s a skyscraper in downtown LA
with steel beams made from the ingot
with the foreman’s body in it 
Somewhere there’s a bridge or underground pipe
with the man’s remains chemically bound
within the molecular structure 
 
Heavy tells a story     
 
and the men lay down their tools
and coffee is poured into heavy ceramic cups
the shanty stills beneath the rumbling
and even foremen stop by
to pay a listen
when Heavy tells a story
