
Its true I have it
though I hardly approve
of anything it does 
 
Supposed bend of light
or smudge where two odd
angles cross  I hardly see 
 
can hardly do a thing
with it  White zone of
no flesh pressing
 
into no  So low I can’t
scale or measure it  I used
to think OK A clean sharp place
 to keep  Or Ill growa thing to keep for me But
no  Its just a ward
 
to mark  mount a loop
I lope around with so
I count
 
myself a realm
of realms  I vote  vote 
Turns out we agree
 
with everything we
do almost  We sweep
the precincts
 
of ourselves the rooms
between each rib
 under them
 
till we reach the fat
red condo where
our blood leans in 
 
We live here now  Half
heart half townhouse 
Come on down 
 
Turn on that sweet TV 
Our mise en place our rugs
 nooks we’re full
 
of stuff  We paint
the furniture we couldn’t
live without  It’s true
 
at last we have it all
though we hardly know
what any of it does
