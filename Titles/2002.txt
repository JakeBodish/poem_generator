
No Time thou shalt not boast that I do changeThy pyramids built up with newer mightTo me are nothing novel nothing strangeThey are but dressings of a former sight Our dates are brief and therefore we admireWhat thou dost foist upon us that is oldAnd rather make them born to our desireThan think that we before have heard them told Thy registers and thee I both defyNot wondering at the present nor the pastFor thy records and what we see doth lieMade more or less by that continual haste    This I do vow and this shall ever be   I will be true despite thy scythe and thee
