Over the top The wire’s thin here unbarbedPlain rusty coils not staked and low enoughFull of old tins though “When you’re through all threeAim quarter left for fifty yards or soThen straight for that new piece of German wireSee if it’s thick and listen for a whileFor sounds of working don’t run any risksAbout an hour now over”                                                    And we placedOur hands on the topmost sand-bags leapt and stoodA second with curved backs then crept to the wireWormed ourselves tinkling through glanced back and dropped The sodden ground was splashed with shallow poolsAnd tufts of crackling cornstalks two years oldNo man had reaped and patches of spring grass Half-seen as rose and sank the flares were strewnThe wrecks of our attack the bandoliersPacks rifles bayonets belts and haversacksShell fragments and the huge whole forms of shellsShot fruitlessly and everywhere the dead Only the dead were always present presentAs a vile sickly smell of rottennessThe rustling stubble and the early grassThe slimy pools   the dead men stank through allPungent and sharp as bodies loomed beforeAnd as we passed they stank then dulled awayTo that vague fœtor all encompassingInfecting earth and air  They lay all clothedEach in some new and piteous attitudeThat we well marked to guide us back as heOutside our wire that lay on his back and crossedHis legs Crusader-wise I smiled at thatAnd thought on Elia and his Temple Church From him at quarter left lay a small corpseDown in a hollow huddled as in a bedThat one of us put his hand on unawares Next was a bunch of half a dozen menAll blown to bits an archipelagoOf corrupt fragments vexing to us threeWho had no light to see by save the flares On such a trail so light for ninety yardsWe crawled on belly and elbows till we sawInstead of lumpish dead before our eyesThe stakes and crosslines of the German wire We lay in shelter of the last dead manOurselves as dead and heard their shovels ringTurning the earth then talk and cough at times A sentry fired and a machine-gun spatThey shot a glare above us when it fellAnd spluttered out in the pools of No Man’s LandWe turned and crawled past the remembered deadPast him and him and them and him untilFor he lay some way apart we caught the scentOf the Crusader and slide past his legsAnd through the wire and home and got our rum
