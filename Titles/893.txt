now While time was our first-Parents had bin warnd The coming of thir secret foe and scapd Haply so scapd his mortal snare for now Satan now first inflamd with rage came down The Tempter ere th Accuser of man-kind To wreck on innocent frail man his loss Of that first Battel and his flight to Hell Yet not rejoycing in his speed though bold Far off and fearless nor with cause to boast Begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth Now rowling boiles in his tumultuous brest And like a devillish Engine back recoiles Upon himself horror and doubt distract His troubld thoughts and from the bottom stirr The Hell within him for within him Hell He brings and round about him nor from Hell One step no more then from himself can fly By change of place Now conscience wakes despair That slumberd wakes the bitter memorie Of what he was what is and what must be Worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue  Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view Lay pleasant his grievd look he fixes sad Sometimes towards Heavn and the full-blazing Sun Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre Then much revolving thus in sighs began  O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd Lookst from thy sole Dominion like the God Of this new World at whose sight all the Starrs Hide thir diminisht heads to thee I call But with no friendly voice and add thy name O Sun to tell thee how I hate thy beams That bring to my remembrance from what state I fell how glorious once above thy Spheare Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down Warring in Heavn against Heavns matchless King Ah wherefore he deservd no such return From me whom he created what I was In that bright eminence and with his good Upbraided none nor was his service hard  What could be less then to afford him praise The easiest recompence and pay him thanks How due yet all his good provd ill in me And wrought but malice lifted up so high I sdeind subjection and thought one step higher Would set me highest and in a moment quit The debt immense of endless gratitude So burthensome still paying still to ow Forgetful what from him I still receivd And understood not that a grateful mind By owing owes not but still pays at once Indebted and dischargd what burden then O had his powerful Destiny ordaind Me some inferiour Angel I had stood Then happie no unbounded hope had raisd Ambition    Yet why not som other Power As great might have aspird and me though mean Drawn to his part but other Powers as great Fell not but stand unshakn from within Or from without to all temptations armd  Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand Thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse But Heavns free Love dealt equally to all Be then his Love accurst since love or hate To me alike it deals eternal woe  Nay cursd be thou since against his thy will Chose freely what it now so justly rues  Me miserable which way shall I flie Infinite wrauth and infinite despaire Which way I flie is Hell my self am Hell And in the lowest deep a lower deep Still threatning to devour me opens wide To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heavn  O then at last relent is there no place Left for Repentance none for Pardon left None left but by submission and that word Disdain forbids me and my dread of shame Among the spirits beneath whom I seducd With other promises and other vaunts Then to submit boasting I could subdue Th Omnipotent    Ay me they little know How dearly I abide that boast so vaine Under what torments inwardly I groane While they adore me on the Throne of Hell With Diadem and Scepter high advancd The lower still I fall onely Supream In miserie such joy Ambition findes  But say I could repent and could obtaine By Act of Grace my former state how soon Would higth recal high thoughts how soon unsay What feignd submission swore ease would recant Vows made in pain as violent and void  For never can true reconcilement grow Where wounds of deadly hate have peircd so deep Which would but lead me to a worse relapse And heavier fall so should I purchase deare Short intermission bought with double smart  This knows my punisher therefore as farr From granting hee as I from begging peace All hope excluded thus behold in stead Of us out-cast exild his new delight Mankind created and for him this World  So farwel Hope and with Hope farwel Fear Farwel Remorse all Good to me is lost Evil be thou my Good by thee at least Divided Empire with Heavns King I hold By thee and more then half perhaps will reigne As Man ere long and this new World shall know  Thus while he spake each passion dimmd his face Thrice changd with pale ire envie and despair Which marrd his borrowd visage and betraid Him counterfet if any eye beheld  For heavnly mindes from such distempers foule Are ever cleer    Whereof hee soon aware Each perturbation smoothd with outward calme Artificer of fraud and was the first That practisd falshood under saintly shew Deep malice to conceale coucht with revenge Yet not anough had practisd to deceive Uriel once warnd whose eye pursud him down The way he went and on th Assyrian mount Saw him disfigurd more then could befall Spirit of happie sort his gestures fierce He markd and mad demeanour then alone As he supposd all unobservd unseen  So on he fares and to the border comes Of Eden where delicious Paradise Now nearer Crowns with her enclosure green As with a rural mound the champain head Of a steep wilderness whose hairie sides With thicket overgrown grottesque and wilde Access denid and over head up grew Insuperable highth of loftiest shade Cedar and Pine and Firr and branching Palm A Silvan Scene and as the ranks ascend Shade above shade a woodie Theatre Of stateliest view    Yet higher then thir tops The verdurous wall of paradise up sprung Which to our general Sire gave prospect large Into his neather Empire neighbouring round  And higher then that Wall a circling row Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue Appeerd with gay enameld colours mixt On which the Sun more glad impressd his beams Then in fair Evening Cloud or humid Bow When God hath showrd the earth so lovely seemd That Lantskip And of pure now purer aire Meets his approach and to the heart inspires Vernal delight and joy able to drive All sadness but despair now gentle gales Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense Native perfumes and whisper whence they stole Those balmie spoiles    As when to them who saile Beyond the Cape of Hope and now are past Mozambic off at Sea North-East windes blow Sabean Odours from the spicie shoare Of Arabie the blest with such delay Well pleasd they slack thir course and many a League Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles  So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend Who came thir bane though with them better pleasd Then Asmodeus with the fishie fume That drove him though enamourd from the Spouse Of Tobits Son and with a vengeance sent From Media post to Aegypt there fast bound  Now to th ascent of that steep savage Hill Satan had journied on pensive and slow But further way found none so thick entwind As one continud brake the undergrowth Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext All path of Man or Beast that past that way One Gate there only was and that lookd East On th other side which when th arch-fellon saw Due entrance he disdaind and in contempt At one slight bound high over leapd all bound Of Hill or highest Wall and sheer within Lights on his feet    As when a prowling Wolfe Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve In hurdld Cotes amid the field secure Leaps ore the fence with ease into the Fould  Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash Of some rich Burgher whose substantial dores Cross-barrd and bolted fast fear no assault In at the window climbs or ore the tiles So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe  Thence up he flew and on the Tree of Life The middle Tree and highest there that grew Sat like a Cormorant yet not true Life Thereby regaind but sat devising Death To them who livd nor on the vertue thought Of that life-giving Plant but only usd For prospect what well usd had bin the pledge Of immortality    So little knows Any but God alone to value right The good before him but perverts best things To worst abuse or to thir meanest use  Beneath him with new wonder now he views To all delight of human sense exposd In narrow room Natures whole wealth yea more A Heavn on Earth for blissful Paradise Of God the Garden was by him in the East Of Eden planted Eden stretchd her Line From Auran Eastward to the Royal Towrs Of great Seleucia built by Grecian Kings Or where the Sons of Eden long before Dwelt in Telassar in this pleasant soile His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind Out of the fertil ground he causd to grow All Trees of noblest kind for sight smell taste And all amid them stood the Tree of Life High eminent blooming Ambrosial Fruit Of vegetable Gold and next to Life Our Death the Tree of knowledge grew fast by Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill  Southward through Eden went a River large Nor changd his course but through the shaggie hill Passd underneath ingulft for God had thrown That Mountain as his Garden mould high raisd Upon the rapid current which through veins Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn Rose a fresh Fountain and with many a rill Waterd the Garden thence united fell Down the steep glade and met the neather Flood Which from his darksom passage now appeers And now divided into four main Streams Runs divers wandring many a famous Realme And Country whereof here needs no account But rather to tell how if Art could tell How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold With mazie error under pendant shades Ran Nectar visiting each plant and fed Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art In Beds and curious Knots but Nature boon Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote The open field and where the unpierct shade lmbround the noontide Bowrs Thus was this place A happy rural seat of various view Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde Hung amiable Hesperian Fables true If true here only and of delicious taste Betwixt them Lawns or level Downs and Flocks Grasing the tender herb were interposd Or palmie hilloc or the flourie lap Of som irriguous Valley spred her store Flours of all hue and without Thorn the Rose Another side umbrageous Grots and Caves Of coole recess ore which the mantling vine Layes forth her purple Grape and gently creeps Luxuriant mean while murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills disperst or in a Lake That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd Her chrystal mirror holds unite thir streams  The Birds thir quire apply aires vernal aires Breathing the smell of field and grove attune The trembling leaves while Universal Pan Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance Led on th Eternal Spring    Not that faire field Of Enna where Proserpin gathering flours Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie Dis Was gatherd which cost Ceres all that pain To seek her through the world nor that sweet Grove Of Daphne by Orontes and th inspird Castalian Spring might with this Paradise Of Eden strive nor that Nyseian Ile Girt with the River Triton where old Cham Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Lybian Jove Hid Amalthea and her Florid Son Young Bacchus from his Stepdame Rheas eye Nor where Abassin Kings thir issue Guard Mount Amara though this by som supposd True Paradise under the Ethiop Line By Nilus head enclosd with shining Rock A whole days journy high but wide remote From this Assyrian Garden where the Fiend Saw undelighted all delight all kind Of living Creatures new to sight and strange Two of far nobler shape erect and tall Godlike erect with native Honour clad In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all And worthie seemd for in thir looks Divine The image of thir glorious Maker shon Truth wisdome Sanctitude severe and pure Severe but in true filial freedom plact Whence true autoritie in men though both Not equal as thir sex not equal seemd For contemplation hee and valour formd For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace Hee for God only shee for God in him His fair large Front and Eye sublime declard Absolute rule and Hyacinthin Locks Round from his parted forelock manly hung Clustring but not beneath his shoulders broad Shee as a vail down to the slender waste Her unadorned golden tresses wore Dissheveld but in wanton ringlets wavd As the Vine curles her tendrils which implid Subjection but requird with gentle sway And by her yielded by him best receivd Yielded with coy submission modest pride And sweet reluctant amorous delay  Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald Then was not guiltie shame dishonest shame Of natures works honor dishonorable Sin-bred how have ye troubld all mankind With shews instead meer shews of seeming pure And banisht from mans life his happiest life Simplicitie and spotless innocence  So passd they naked on nor shund the sight Of God or Angel for they thought no ill So hand in hand they passd the lovliest pair That ever since in loves imbraces met Adam the goodliest man of men since borne His Sons the fairest of her Daughters Eve  Under a tuft of shade that on a green Stood whispering soft by a fresh Fountain side They sat them down and after no more toil Of thir sweet Gardning labour then sufficd To recommend coole Zephyr and made ease More easie wholsom thirst and appetite More grateful to thir Supper Fruits they fell Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes Yielded them side-long as they sat recline On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours The savourie pulp they chew and in the rinde Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream Nor gentle purpose nor endearing smiles Wanted nor youthful dalliance as beseems Fair couple linkt in happie nuptial League Alone as they    About them frisking playd All Beasts of th Earth since wilde and of all chase In Wood or Wilderness Forrest or Den Sporting the Lion rampd and in his paw Dandld the Kid Bears Tygers Ounces Pards Gambold before them th unwieldy Elephant To make them mirth usd all his might and wreathd His Lithe Proboscis close the Serpent sly Insinuating wove with Gordian twine His breaded train and of his fatal guile Gave proof unheeded others on the grass Coucht and now fild with pasture gazing sat Or Bedward ruminating for the Sun Declind was hasting now with prone carreer To th Ocean Iles and in th ascending Scale Of Heavn the Starrs that usher Evening rose When Satan still in gaze as first he stood Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad  O Hell what doe mine eyes with grief behold Into our room of bliss thus high advanct Creatures of other mould earth-born perhaps Not Spirits yet to heavnly Spirits bright Little inferior whom my thoughts pursue With wonder and could love so lively shines In them Divine resemblance and such grace The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd  Ah gentle pair yee little think how nigh Your change approaches when all these delights Will vanish and deliver ye to woe More woe the more your taste is now of joy Happie but for so happie ill securd Long to continue and this high seat your Heavn Ill fenct for Heavn to keep out such a foe As now is enterd yet no purposd foe To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne Though I unpittied League with you I seek And mutual amitie so streight so close That I with you must dwell or you with me Henceforth my dwelling haply may not please Like this fair Paradise your sense yet such Accept your Makers work he gave it me Which I as freely give Hell shall unfold To entertain you two her widest Gates And send forth all her Kings there will be room Not like these narrow limits to receive ass Your numerous ofspring if no better place Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd  And should I at your harmless innocence Melt as I doe yet public reason just Honour and Empire with revenge enlargd By conquering this new World compels me now To do what else though damnd I should abhorre  So spake the Fiend and with necessitie The Tyrants plea excusd his devilish deeds  Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree Down he alights among the sportful Herd Of those fourfooted kindes himself now one Now other as thir shape servd best his end Neerer to view his prey and unespid To mark what of thir state he more might learn By word or action markt about them round A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare Then as a Tyger who by chance hath spid In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play Strait couches close then rising changes oft His couchant watch as one who chose his ground Whence rushing he might surest seize them both Gript in each paw When Adam first of men To first of women Eve thus moving speech Turnd him all eare to hear new utterance flow  Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes Dearer thy self then all needs must the power That made us and for us this ample World Be infinitly good and of his good As liberal and free as infinite That raisd us from the dust and plact us here In all this happiness who at his hand Have nothing merited nor can performe Aught whereof hee hath need hee who requires From us no other service then to keep This one this easie charge of all the Trees In Paradise that bear delicious fruit So various not to taste that onely Tree Of knowledge planted by the Tree of Life So neer grows Death to Life what ere Death is Som dreadful thing no doubt for well thou knowst God hath pronounct it death to taste that Tree The only sign of our obedience left Among so many signes of power and rule Conferrd upon us and Dominion givn Over all other Creatures that possess Earth Aire and Sea    Then let us not think hard One easie prohibition who enjoy Free leave so large to all things else and choice Unlimited of manifold delights But let us ever praise him and extoll His bountie following our delightful task To prune these growing Plants and tend these Flours Which were it toilsom yet with thee were sweet  To whom thus Eve replid    O thou for whom And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh And without whom am to no end my Guide And Head what thou hast said is just and right  For wee to him indeed all praises owe And daily thanks I chiefly who enjoy So farr the happier Lot enjoying thee Praeeminent by so much odds while thou Like consort to thy self canst no where find  That day I oft remember when from sleep I first awakt and found my self reposd Under a shade of flours much wondring where And what I was whence thither brought and how  Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound Of waters issud from a Cave and spread Into a liquid Plain then stood unmovd Pure as th expanse of Heavn I thither went With unexperienct thought and laid me downe On the green bank to look into the cleer Smooth Lake that to me seemd another Skie  As I bent down to look just opposite A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd Bending to look on me I started back It started back but pleasd I soon returnd Pleasd it returnd as soon with answering looks Of sympathie and love there I had fixt Mine eyes till now and pind with vain desire Had not a voice thus warnd me   What thou seest What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self With thee it came and goes but follow me And I will bring thee where no shadow staies Thy coming and thy soft imbraces hee Whose image thou art him thou shall enjoy Inseparablie thine to him shalt beare Multitudes like thy self and thence be calld Mother of human Race what could I doe But follow strait invisibly thus led Till I espid thee fair indeed and tall Under a Platan yet methought less faire Less winning soft less amiablie milde Then that smooth watry image back I turnd Thou following crydst aloud Return faire Eve Whom flist thou whom thou flist of him thou art His flesh his bone to give thee being I lent Out of my side to thee neerest my heart Substantial Life to have thee by my side Henceforth an individual solace dear Part of my Soul I seek thee and thee claim My other half with that thy gentle hand Seisd mine I yielded and from that time see How beauty is excelld by manly grace And wisdom which alone is truly fair  So spake our general Mother and with eyes Of conjugal attraction unreprovd And meek surrender half imbracing leand On our first Father half her swelling Breast Naked met his under the flowing Gold Of her loose tresses hid he in delight Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms Smild with superior Love as Jupiter On Juno smiles when he impregns the Clouds That shed May Flowers and pressd her Matron lip With kisses pure aside the Devil turnd For envie yet with jealous leer maligne Eyd them askance and to himself thus plaind  Sight hateful sight tormenting thus these two Imparadist in one anothers arms The happier Eden shall enjoy thir fill Of bliss on bliss while I to Hell am thrust Where neither joy nor love but fierce desire Among our other torments not the least Still unfulfilld with pain of longing pines Yet let me not forget what I have gaind From thir own mouths all is not theirs it seems One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge calld Forbidden them to taste Knowledge forbiddn Suspicious reasonless    Why should thir Lord Envie them that can it be sin to know Can it be death and do they onely stand By Ignorance is that thir happie state The proof of thir obedience and thir faith O fair foundation laid whereon to build Thir ruine Hence I will excite thir minds With more desire to know and to reject Envious commands invented with designe To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt Equal with Gods aspiring to be such They taste and die what likelier can ensue But first with narrow search I must walk round This Garden and no corner leave unspid A chance but chance may lead where I may meet Some wandring Spirit of Heavn by Fountain side Or in thick shade retird from him to draw What further would be learnt    Live while ye may Yet happie pair enjoy till I return Short pleasures for long woes are to succeed  So saying his proud step he scornful turnd But with sly circumspection and began Through wood through waste ore hill ore dale his roam  Mean while in utmost Longitude where Heavn With Earth and Ocean meets the setting Sun Slowly descended and with right aspect Against the eastern Gate of Paradise Leveld his eevning Rayes it was a Rock Of Alablaster pild up to the Clouds Conspicuous farr winding with one ascent Accessible from Earth one entrance high The rest was craggie cliff that overhung Still as it rose impossible to climbe  Betwixt these rockie Pillars Gabriel sat Chief of th Angelic Guards awaiting night About him exercisd Heroic Games Th unarmed Youth of Heavn but nigh at hand Celestial Armourie Shields Helmes and Speares Hung high with Diamond flaming and with Gold  Thither came Uriel gliding through the Eeven On a Sun beam swift as a shooting Starr In Autumn thwarts the night when vapors fird Impress the Air and shews the Mariner From what point of his Compass to beware Impetuous winds he thus began in haste  Gabriel to thee thy course by Lot hath givn Charge and strict watch that to this happie Place No evil thing approach or enter in This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare A Spirit zealous as he seemd to know More of th Almighties works and chiefly Man Gods latest Image I describd his way Bent all on speed and markt his Aerie Gate But in the Mount that lies from Eden North Where he first lighted soon discernd his looks Alien from Heavn with passions foul obscurd Mine eye pursud him still but under shade Lost sight of him one of the banisht crew I fear hath venturd from the deep to raise New troubles him thy care must be to find  To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd Uriel no wonder if thy perfet sight Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst See farr and wide in at this Gate none pass The vigilance here plact but such as come Well known from Heavn and since Meridian hour No Creature thence if Spirit of other sort So minded have oreleapt these earthie bounds On purpose hard thou knowst it to exclude Spiritual substance with corporeal barr  But if within the circuit of these walks In whatsoever shape he lurk of whom Thou tellst by morrow dawning I shall know  So promisd hee and Uriel to his charge Returnd on that bright beam whose point now raisd Bore him slope downward to the Sun now falln Beneath th Azores whither the prime Orb Incredible how swift had thither rowld Diurnal or this less volubil Earth By shorter flight to th East had left him there Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend Now came still Eevning on and Twilight gray Had in her sober Liverie all things clad Silence accompanied for Beast and Bird They to thir grassie Couch these to thir Nests Were slunk all but the wakeful Nightingale She all night long her amorous descant sung Silence was pleasd now glowd the Firmament With living Saphirs Hesperus that led The starrie Host rode brightest till the Moon Rising in clouded Majestie at length Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light And ore the dark her Silver Mantle threw  When Adam thus to Eve Fair Consort th hour Of night and all things now retird to rest Mind us of like repose since God hath set Labour and rest as day and night to men Successive and the timely dew of sleep Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines Our eye-lids other Creatures all day long Rove idle unimploid and less need rest Man hath his daily work of body or mind Appointed which declares his Dignitie And the regard of Heavn on all his waies While other Animals unactive range And of thir doings God takes no account  To morrow ere fresh Morning streak the East With first approach of light we must be risn And at our pleasant labour to reform Yon flourie Arbors yonder Allies green Our walk at noon with branches overgrown That mock our scant manuring and require More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth Those Blossoms also and those dropping Gumms That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth Ask riddance if we mean to tread with ease Mean while as Nature wills Night bids us rest  To whom thus Eve with perfet beauty adornd  My Author and Disposer what thou bidst Unargud I obey so God ordains God is thy Law thou mine to know no more Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise  With thee conversing I forget all time All seasons and thir change all please alike  Sweet is the breath of morn her rising sweet With charm of earliest Birds pleasant the Sun When first on this delightful Land he spreads His orient Beams on herb tree fruit and flour Glistring with dew fragrant the fertil earth After soft showers and sweet the coming on Of grateful Eevning milde then silent Night With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon And these the Gemms of Heavn her starrie train But neither breath of Morn when she ascends With charm of earliest Birds nor rising Sun On this delightful land nor herb fruit floure Glistring with dew nor fragrance after showers Nor grateful Eevning mild nor silent Night With this her solemn Bird nor walk by Moon Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet  But wherfore all night long shine these for whom This glorious sight when sleep hath shut all eyes To whom our general Ancestor replid  Daughter of God and Man accomplisht Eve Those have thir course to finish round the Earth By morrow Eevning and from Land to Land In order though to Nations yet unborn Ministring light prepard they set and rise Least total darkness should by Night regaine Her old possession and extinguish life In Nature and all things which these soft fires Not only enlighten but with kindly heate Of various influence foment and warme Temper or nourish or in part shed down Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow On Earth made hereby apter to receive Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray  These then though unbeheld in deep of night Shine not in vain nor think though men were none That heavn would want spectators God want praise Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth Unseen both when we wake and when we sleep  All these with ceasless praise his works behold Both day and night how often from the steep Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard Celestial voices to the midnight air Sole or responsive each to others note Singing thir great Creator oft in bands While they keep watch or nightly rounding walk With Heavnly touch of instrumental sounds In full harmonic number joind thir songs Divide the night and lift our thoughts to Heaven  Thus talking hand in hand alone they passd On to thir blissful Bower it was a place Chosn

Acanthus and each odorous bushie shrub Fencd up the verdant wall each beauteous flour Iris all hues Roses and Gessamin Reard high thir flourisht heads between and wrought Mosaic underfoot the Violet Crocus and Hyacinth with rich inlay Broiderd the ground more colourd then with stone Of costliest Emblem other Creature here Beast Bird Insect or Worm durst enter none Such was thir awe of Man    In shadie Bower More sacred and sequesterd though but feignd Pan or Silvanus never slept nor Nymph Nor Faunus haunted    Here in close recess With Flowers Garlands and sweet-smelling Herbs Espoused Eve deckt first her nuptial Bed And heavnly Quires the Hymenaean sung What day the genial Angel to our Sire Brought her in naked beauty more adornd More lovely then Pandora whom the Gods Endowd with all

place For us too large where thy abundance wants Partakers and uncropt falls to the ground  But thou hast promisd from us two a Race To fill the Earth who shall with us extoll Thy goodness infinite both when we wake And when we seek as now thy gift of sleep  This said unanimous and other Rites Observing none but adoration pure Which God likes best into thir inmost bowre Handed they went and easd

Showrd Roses which the Morn repaird    Sleep on Blest pair and O yet happiest if ye seek No happier state and know to know no more  Now had night measurd with her shaddowie Cone Half way up Hill this

half these draw off and coast the South With strictest watch these other wheel the North Our circuit meets full West  As flame they part Half wheeling to the Shield half to the Spear  From these two

fair Creatures Lodge Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme  This Eevning from the Suns decline arrivd Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen Hitherward bent who could have thought escapd The barrs of Hell on errand bad no doubt Such where ye find seise fast and hither bring  So saying on he led his radiant Files Dazling the Moon these to the Bower direct In search of whom they sought him there they found Squat like a Toad close at the eare of Eve Assaying by his Devilish art to reach The Organs of her Fancie and with them forge Illusions as he list Phantasms and Dreams Or if inspiring venom

shalt give account To him who sent us whose charge is to keep This place inviolable and these from harm  So spake the Cherube and his grave rebuke Severe in youthful beautie added grace Invincible abasht the Devil stood And felt how awful goodness is and saw Vertue in her shape how lovly saw and pind His loss but chiefly to find here observd His lustre visibly impard yet seemd Undaunted    If I must contend said he Best with the best the Sender not the sent Or all at once more glorie will be wonn Or less be lost    Thy fear said Zephon bold Will save us trial what the least can doe Single against thee wicked and thence weak  The Fiend replid not overcome with rage But like a proud Steed reind went hautie on Chaumping his iron curb to strive or flie He held it vain awe from above had quelld His heart not else dismaid    Now drew they nigh The western Point where those half-rounding guard just met and closing stood in squadron joind Awaiting next command    To whom thir Chief Gabriel from the Front thus calld aloud  O friends I hear the tread of nimble feet Hasting this way and now by glimps discerne Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade And with them comes a third of Regal port But faded splendor wan who by his gate And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell Not likely to part hence without contest Stand firm for in his look defiance lours  He scarce had ended when those two approachd And brief related whom they brought where found How busied in what form and posture coucht  To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake  Why hast thou Satan broke the bounds prescribd To thy transgressions and disturbd the charge Of others who approve not to transgress By thy example but have power and right To question thy bold entrance on this place Imploid it seems to violate sleep and those Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow  Gabriel thou hadst in Heavn th esteem of wise And such I held thee but this question askt Puts me in doubt    Lives ther who loves his pain Who would not finding way break loose from Hell Though thither doomd Thou wouldst thy self no doubt And boldly venture to whatever place Farthest from pain where thou mightest hope to change Torment with ease and soonest recompence Dole with delight which in this place I sought To thee no reason who knowst only good But evil hast not trid and wilt object His will who bound us let him surer barr His Iron Gates if he intends our stay In that dark durance thus much what was askt  The rest is true they found me where they say But that implies not violence or harme  Thus he in scorn The warlike Angel movd Disdainfully half smiling thus replid  O loss of one in Heavn to judge of wise Since Satan fell whom follie overthrew And now returns him from his prison scapt Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise Or not who ask what boldness brought him hither Unlicenct from his bounds in Hell prescribd So wise he judges it to fly from pain However and to scape his punishment  So judge thou still presumptuous till the wrauth Which thou incurrst by flying meet thy flight Seavenfold and scourge that wisdom back to Hell Which taught thee yet no better that no pain Can equal anger infinite provokt  But wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee Came not all Hell broke loose is pain to them Less pain less to be fled or thou then they Less hardie to endure courageous Chief The first in flight from pain hadst thou alledgd To thy deserted host this cause of flight Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive  To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern  Not that I less endure or shrink from pain Insulting Angel well thou knowst I stood Thy fiercest when in Battel to thy aide Thy blasting volied Thunder made all speed And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear  But still thy words at random as before Argue thy inexperience what behooves From hard assaies and ill successes past A faithful Leader not to hazard all Through wayes of danger by himself untrid  I therefore I alone first undertook To wing the desolate Abyss and spie This new created World whereof in Hell Fame is not silent here in hope to find Better abode and my afflicted Powers To settle here on Earth or in mid Aire Though for possession put to try once more What thou and thy gay Legions dare against Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord High up in Heavn with songs to hymne his Throne And practisd distances to cringe not fight  To whom the warriour Angel soon replid  To say and strait unsay pretending first Wise to flie pain professing next the Spie Argues no Leader but a lyar tract Satan and couldst thou faithful add O name O sacred name of faithfulness profand Faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew Armie of Fiends fit body to fit head Was this your discipline and faith ingagd Your military obedience to dissolve Allegeance to th acknowldgd Power supream And thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem Patron of liberty who more then thou Once fawnd and cringd and servilly adord Heavns awful Monarch wherefore but in hope To dispossess him and thy self to reigne But mark what I arreede thee now avant Flie thither whence thou fledst if from this houre Within these hallowd limits thou appeer Back to th infernal pit I drag thee chaind And Seale thee so as henceforth not to scorne The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd  So threatnd hee but Satan to no threats Gave heed but waxing more in rage replid  Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines Proud limitarie Cherube but ere then Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel From my prevailing arme though Heavens King Ride on thy wings and thou with thy Compeers Usd to the yoak drawst his triumphant wheels In progress through the rode of Heavn Star-pavd  While thus he spake th Angelic Squadron bright Turnd fierie red sharpning in mooned hornes Thir Phalanx and began to hemm him round With ported Spears as thick as when a field Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends Her bearded Grove of ears which way the wind Swayes them the careful Plowman doubting stands Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves Prove chaff  On th other side Satan allarmd Collecting all his might dilated stood Like Teneriff or Atlas unremovd His stature reacht the Skie and on his Crest Sat horror Plumd nor wanted in his graspe What seemd both Spear and Shield now dreadful deeds Might have ensud nor onely Paradise In this commotion but the Starrie Cope Of Heavn perhaps or all the Elements At least had gon to rack disturbd and torne With violence of this conflict had not soon Th Eternal to prevent such horrid fray Hung forth in Heavn his golden Scales yet seen Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion signe Wherein all things created first he weighd The pendulous round Earth with ballanct Aire In counterpoise now ponders all events Battels and Realms in these he put two weights The sequel each of parting and of fight The latter quick up flew and kickt the beam Which Gabriel spying thus bespake the Fiend  Satan I know thy strength and thou knowst mine Neither our own but givn what follie then To boast what Arms can doe since thine no more Then Heavn permits nor mine though doubld now To trample thee as mire for proof look up And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign Where thou art weighd and shown how light how weak If thou resist  The Fiend lookt up and knew His mounted scale aloft nor more but fled Murmuring and with him fled the shades of night
