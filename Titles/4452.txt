
Today I woke and believed in nothing 
A grief at once intimate and unfelt
like the death of a good friend’s dog 
Tired of the mind reaching back in the past for rescue
I praise the day 
I don’t mean merely some mythical isolate instant
like the mindless mindfulness specialist
who at the terminal cancer convention
not that it was called that
exhorted the new year’s crop of slaughters
ditto
to “taste” the day this one unreplicable instant of being alive 
The chicken glistened 
Nor do I mean a day devoid of past and future
as craved that great craze of minds and times Fernando Pessoa
who wanted not “the present” but reality itself
things in their thingness rather than the time that measures them 
Time is in the table at which I sit and in the words I type 
In the red-checked shirt my father’s mother used to wear
when she was gardening and which I kept
because it held her smell though it does no longer
there is still plenty of time 
Two murderers keep their minds alive
while they wait to die 
They talk through slots in their doors
of whatever mercy or misery
the magazine has ordained for the day   
the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan say
ten signs that a relationship is on the rocks 
When their communion flags as communions will
they rekindle it with personal revelations philosophical digressions
humor  This is a true story
one of them says sometimes by way of preface
as if that gave the moment more gravity
asked of the listener a different attention
at once resisted and reinforced an order
wherein every hour has its sound every day its grace
and every death is by design 
“Love is possible for anyone” I hear the TV talk-show host say
which is true in the way most things in this life are true
which is to say false
unless and until the nullifying catalyzing death is felt 
Love is possible for anyone
because it is equally impossible for everyone 
To be is to be confronted with a void
a blankness a blackness that both appeals and appalls 
Once known   known by the void I mean   one has three choices 
Walk away and unlearn the instinct of awe 
Walk along and learn to believe that awe asks nothing of you 
Are you with me love
For love read faith 
Naked once and after a rat my father cried “Die vermin die”
banging the broomstick over and over on the floor
so incorrigibly dirty it might as well have been the earth itself 
This is my mother’s story though I was there I’m told
and no small part of the pandemonium 
We were five souls crammed into one life
and so incorrigibly poor   or was that fear   we all slept in one room
and shared one great big chester drawers as we called it
and not with irony but in earnest ignorance
just as like meant lack as in
“How much do you like bein’ done with your chemo”
and just as I and every other child I knew
before we tucked into our lemon meringue pie
solemnly wiped the calf slobbers off 
Ah local color peasant levity the language fuming and steaming
rich as the mist of rot that rises off the compost heap
“kitchen midden” you might hear an old Scot still say 
When do we first know That there’s a world
to which we’ve been not oblivious exactly
but so inside we couldn’t see it who now see nothing else
Heaven is over  Or hell 
Did you forget the rat
It thumps and thrashes like a poltergeist inside
the chest of drawers but somehow though my father is fast
and though his rage is becoming real every drawer he opens
is empty  What happens when we die
every child of every father eventually asks 
What happens when we don’t
is the better question 
To kill a wasp on water is the peak of speed 
My brother who is other has a mind of lead 
I with my stinging griefs watch from away 
How can it be there are no adults left
What matters here is timing not time 
His hand is high and white above the blue 
A wasp is also atom and urge hover and touch 
Even wings are not a clean distinction 
Down comes the slap like a rifle shot 
What vengeance can there be on blank necessity
My brother who is other has a way 
His hand is high and white  And then it’s not 
Once when my father’s mother’s health was failing
and she found it more and more difficult to tend
to the tiny family plot at Champion Texas
which is less town than time at this point
a blink of old buildings and older longings the rare driver
flashes past I took it upon myself to salt the graves
as I must have read somewhere would work for unwanted growths 
As indeed it did 
In the months after every Sunday when we spoke
she thanked me for the blankness the blackness
my words of course
this new ease I had allowed her mind 
Until one day leaning over with flowers the leached earth
opened and my eighty-year-old grandmother
tumbled right down among the bones
of the woman from whom she’d first emerged 
To see that image you have to be that sky 
It has to happen in you that crushing calling viewless blue
that is so deeply in you that it is not you 
“O Law’ honey I like to died ”
You don’t climb out of poverty so much as carry it with you 
Some shell themselves with wealth 
Some get and spend get and spend skimming existence like a Jesus lizard 
But for those whose souls have known true want
  whose souls perhaps are true want   
money remains in some sense permanently inert
like an erotic thought that flashes through a eunuch’s brain 
In 1980 my father bought his first airplane
a scream-proof four-seater we crammed five inside
which he considerately slammed into a sorghum field alone 
Unkillable he killed the next ten years with work and wives
then bought another and brought it down in the solitary fire
that was his aspect and atmosphere  Homes schemes
thirty years of savings plowed into a sign company 
that did not it turned out exist 
A hole is hard to carry 
People ask if I believe in God and the verb is tedious to me 
Not wrong not offensive not intrusive not embarrassing 
Tedious 
Today I saw a hawk land on Elizabeth’s chimney 
It sat with its bone frown and banker’s breast
above the proud houses of Hamden 
Are you with me Then see
too a lump of animate ash rising from the flue
or so it seems to be a pigeon
fluttering dumbly down
next to that implacable raptor
suddening a world of strange relations
wherein there is no need for fear or far
or meat 
There was a man made of airplane parts
one of which was always missing 
He wandered the hospital grounds in search of a rudder
an aileron or some other fragment
that would let him fly from this place
where he was not meant to be 
There was a woman who emitted invective
ceaselessly dispassionately an obscenity machine 
One timid gentleman saved Saran wrap for five full years
and every night wrought an ever-more-solid ball
with which it turned out he planned to bash the skull
of the first soul he saw the dawn God blessed his weapon 
A success story alas 
Another man with anvil hands sat six months of nights in faith
that there would come occasion of darkness unguardedness and vision
sufficient to rip from its socket one of my father’s bright blue eyes 
Ditto 
My father moved among them like a father 
He attended and pacified he instructed and consoled 
Late to the trade he worked too much
and trusted his heart no doubt more than he should
but was by all accounts at this one thing and despite the end good 
For love read faith
into these lines that so obviously lack it 
For love let words turn to life
in the way life turns to world
under the observer’s eye the swirl
of particles with their waves and entanglements
their chance and havoc resolving
into some one thing
a raptor on a rooftop say 
No power on earth can make it stay 
But is it lost or released into formlessness
when we look away
To be is to believe
that the man or woman
who inscribed with an idiosyncratic but demanding calligraphyFuck da money   Trust no one
on the rough blanket of the residential motel
where my father spent the last two years of his rough residential life
intended the note of defiant self-conscious da humor
that left my father whom I had not seen in years
and I whom years had seen grow sere far even from myself
erupting in laughter until we cried 
Before my good friend’s good dog died
ten times a day she pressed her forehead to his
“to confirm the world and her place in it ”
Now she won’t even say his name 
Strange how the things that burn worst in one heart
one must keep silent to keep 
Ten to one you thought of men 
The murderers I mean 
But no  This is a true story 
There is another cell you see
in which a woman I have known since childhood
and since childhood have known to be
suspended on a wire of time but nimble-witted nonetheless
lies on the cold stone floor 
She is even more naked than they have made her 
She has killed no one not even herself 
Punishment perhaps or some contagion of fate finds her here
her hair shorn both wrists wrapped her eyes open
pondering the parable of perfect silence Remember he said memory is a poor man’s prison 
Make to have and to love one live infinitive
