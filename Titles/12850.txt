
How soon hath Time the subtle thief of youth
       Stoln on his wing my three-and-twentieth year
       My hasting days fly on with full career
       But my late spring no bud or blossom shewth 
Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth
       That I to manhood am arrivd so near
       And inward ripeness doth much less appear
       That some more timely-happy spirits enduth 
Yet be it less or more or soon or slow
       It shall be still in strictest measure evn
       To that same lot however mean or high
Toward which Time leads me and the will of Heavn
       All is if I have grace to use it so
       As ever in my great Task-Masters eye
