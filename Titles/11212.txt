
One Christmastime Fats Waller in a fur coat
Rolled beaming from a taxicab with two pretty girls   
Each at an arm as he led them in a thick downy snowfall
Across Thirty-Fourth Street into the busy crowd
Shopping at Macy’s perfume holly snowflake displays 
Chimes rang for change  In Toys where my mother worked
Over her school vacation the crowd swelled and stood
Filling the aisles whispered at the fringes listening
To the sounds of the large gorgeously dressed man
His smile bemused and exalted lips boom-booming a bold
Bass line as he improvised on an expensive tinkly
Piano the size of a lady’s jewel box or a wedding cake 
She put into my heart this scene from the romance of Joy
Co-authored by her and the movies like her others–
My father making the winning basket at the buzzer
And punching the enraged gambler who came onto the court–
The brilliant black and white of the movies texture
Of wet snowy fur the taxi’s windshield piano keys
Reflections that slid over the thick brass baton
That worked the elevator  Happiness needs a setting
Shepherds and shepherdesses in the grass kids in a store
The back room of Carly’s parents’ shop record-player
And paper streamers twisted in two colors what I felt
Dancing close one afternoon with a thin blonde girl
Was my amazing good luck the pleased erection
Stretching and stretching at the idea She likes me
She likes it
