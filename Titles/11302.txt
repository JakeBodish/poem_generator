Thought thrusts up homely as a hyacinth   
wrapped in its bulb like a root-vegetable   
a ninth-month   
belly where the green indelible   
patterns inscribed into the labyrinth    
Thrust into light its airs inhabitant   
with light and air as food and drink    
A hyacinth tumescent pink   
on the low wooden Mexican chest   
confronts the wintry dusk   
with informed self-interest    
Leaf-spears extravagantly ask   
what idea still gnarled up in a knot   
of ganglions will break through the husk   
shaped at last recognizable as thought    
•
   
Trace on a city map trajectories   
of partially-forgotten words   
along the rivers arteries   
volatile substance of a sentient world    
Mauve heather crowds the window-grill  The light   
lingers a little later with a slight   
vernal inflection  In a moon-glazed vase   
bloom yellow freesias like some rainy days   
brook-bank in someone elses memory    
Small whirlpools of perception widen ring   
an infants numinous discoveries   
of syllables for animals toys trees   
a Labs thick coat the dusty birds   
in Claremont Park each tardy urban spring   
a stuffed pink leather horse with button eyes    
•
   
A question-mark in yellow overalls   
I could read  I was three    
I slept with that pink horse  My one dolls   
name was V  J  Shed been given to me   
to celebrate the Victory   
over Japan that is to say the Bomb   
Id spend my schooldays taking shelter from    
I couldnt tie my shoes  But Reddy the fox   
Tootle the engine who jumped off the tracks   
spelled me their stories on my mothers lap   
despite weak eyes and poor small-motor skills    
My grandparents were dead not in pogroms   
not in the camps of strokes and heart attacks   
merely immigrants not deportees    
When you die does everything just stop

Im four in itchy woolen leggings   
the day that I cant recognize the man   
down at the park entrance waving   
as my father  He has ten   
more years to live that spring  Dapper and balding   
he walks toward me then I run toward him calling   
him flustered by my flawed vision    
Underfoot the maples green-   
winged seeds splay on mica-specked octagons    
His round face thin nose moustache silvered gray   
at thirty-eight look I think now Hungarian    
I like his wood-smell of two packs a day   
as he swings me up to his shoulder   
and I say things look blurry far away   
 one Saturday two years after the war
