
Open the gates the gates of the TempleSwift to Thy sons who Thy truths have displayed Open the gates the gates that are hiddenSwift to Thy sons who Thy Law have obeyed Open the gates of the coveted TempleSwift to Thy sons who confess and seek grace Open the gates of the armies celestialSwift to Thy sons Judah’s tearful-eyed race Open the gates the radiant portalsSwift to Thy sons who are lovely and pure Open the gates of the crown of fidelitySwift to Thy sons who in God rest secure
