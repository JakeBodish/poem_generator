
How I’ve changed may not be apparent I limp  Read and write make tea at the stoveas I practiced in rehab  Sometimes like fire a task overwhelms me  I cry for days shriek when the phone rings  Like a page pulled from flameI’m singed but intact I don’t burn down the house Later cleared to drive I did outpatient rehab  Otherslost legs or clutched withered minds in their hands A man who can’t speak recognized meand held up his finger  I knew he meant One year since your surgery  Sixteen since his Guadalupe wishes daily to be the one before  Nobodyis that  Sometimes like love the neurons just cross fire You don’t get everything back
