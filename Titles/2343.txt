
I would not paint   a picture  
Id rather be the One
Its bright impossibility
To dwell   delicious   on  
And wonder how the fingers feel
Whose rare   celestial   stir  
Evokes so sweet a torment  
Such sumptuous   Despair  
I would not talk like Cornets  
Id rather be the One
Raised softly to the Ceilings  
And out and easy on  
Through Villages of Ether  
Myself endued Balloon
By but a lip of Metal  
The pier to my Pontoon  
Nor would I be a Poet  
Its finer   Own the Ear  
Enamored   impotent   content  
The License to revere
A privilege so awful
What would the Dower be
Had I the Art to stun myself
With Bolts   of Melody
