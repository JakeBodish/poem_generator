
Little soul
you have wandered
lost a long time 
The woods all dark now
birded and eyed 
Then a light a cabin a fire a door standing open 
The fairy tales warn you
Do not go in
you who would eat will be eaten 
You go in  You quicken 
You want to have feet 
You want to have eyes 
You want to have fears
