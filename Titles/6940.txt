friend never fear Treat his own subject after his own way Fix his own time accept too his own price And shut the money into this small hand When next it takes mine  Will it tenderly Oh Ill content him but to-morrow Love I often am much wearier than you think This evening more than usual and it seems As if forgive now should you let me sit Here by the window with your hand in mine And look a half-hour forth on Fiesole Both of one mind as married people use Quietly quietly the evening through I might get up to-morrow to my work Cheerful and fresh as ever  Let us try  To-morrow how you shall be glad for this Your soft hand is a woman of itself And mine the mans bared breast she curls inside  Dont count the time lost neither you must serve For each of the five pictures we require It saves a model  So keep looking so  My serpentining beauty rounds on rounds  How could you ever prick those perfect ears Even to put the pearl there oh so sweet  My face my moon my everybodys moon Which everybody looks on and calls his And I suppose is looked on by in turn While she looks no ones very dear no less  You smile why theres my picture ready made Theres what we painters call our harmony A common greyness silvers everything  All in a twilight you and I alike  You at the point of your first pride in me Thats gone you know but I at every point My youth my hope my art being all toned down To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole  Theres the bell clinking from the chapel-top That length of convent-wall across the way Holds the trees safer huddled more inside The last monk leaves the garden days decrease And autumn grows autumn in everything  Eh the whole seems to fall into a shape As if I saw alike my work and self And all that I was born to be and do A twilight-piece  Love we are in Gods hand  How strange now looks the life he makes us lead So free we seem so fettered fast we are I feel he laid the fetter let it lie This chamber for example turn your head  All thats behind us You dont understand Nor care to understand about my art But you can hear at least when people speak And that cartoon the second from the door  It is the thing Love so such things should be  Behold Madonna I am bold to say     I can do with my pencil what I know What I see what at bottom of my heart I wish for if I ever wish so deep  Do easily too when I say perfectly I do not boast perhaps yourself are judge Who listened to the Legates talk last week And just as much they used to say in France  At any rate tis easy all of it No sketches first no studies thats long past I do what many dream of all their lives  Dream strive to do and agonize to do And fail in doing  I could count twenty such On twice your fingers and not leave this town Who strive you dont know how the others strive To paint a little thing like that you smeared Carelessly passing with your robes afloat  Yet do much less so much less Someone says I know his name no matter so much less Well less is more Lucrezia I am judged  There burns a truer light of God in them In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain Heart or whateer else than goes on to prompt This low-pulsed forthright craftsmans hand of mine  Their works drop groundward but themselves I know Reach many a time a heaven thats shut to me Enter and take their place there sure enough Though they come back and cannot tell the world  My works are nearer heaven but I sit here  The sudden blood of these men at a word  Praise them it boils or blame them it boils too  I painting from myself and to myself Know what I do am unmoved by mens blame Or their praise either  Somebody remarks Morellos outline there is wrongly traced His hue mistaken what of that or else Rightly traced and well ordered what of that Speak as they please what does the mountain care Ah but a mans reach should exceed his grasp Or whats a heaven for All is silver-grey Placid and perfect with my art the worse I know both what I want and what might gain And yet how profitless to know to sigh Had I been two another and myself Our head would have oerlooked the world No doubt  Yonders a work now of that famous youth The Urbinate who died five years ago  Tis copied George Vasari sent it me  Well I can fancy how he did it all Pouring his soul with kings and popes to see Reaching that heaven might so replenish him Above and through his art for it gives way That arm is wrongly put and there again  A fault to pardon in the drawings lines Its body so to speak its soul is right He means right that a child may understand  Still what an arm and I could alter it But all the play the insight and the stretch  Out of me out of me And wherefore out Had you enjoined them on me given me soul We might have risen to Rafael I and you Nay Love you did give all I asked I think  More than I merit yes by many times  But had you oh with the same perfect brow And perfect eyes and more than perfect mouth And the low voice my soul hears as a bird The fowlers pipe and follows to the snare   Had you with these the same but brought a mind Some women do so  Had the mouth there urged God and the glory never care for gain  The present by the future what is that Live for fame side by side with Agnolo Rafael is waiting up to God all three I might have done it for you  So it seems Perhaps not  All is as God over-rules  Beside incentives come from the souls self The rest avail not  Why do I need you What wife had Rafael or has Agnolo In this world who can do a thing will not And who would do it cannot I perceive Yet the wills somewhat somewhat too the power  And thus we half-men struggle  At the end God I conclude compensates punishes  Tis safer for me if the award be strict That I am something underrated here Poor this long while despised to speak the truth  I dared not do you know leave home all day For fear of chancing on the Paris lords  The best is when they pass and look aside But they speak sometimes I must bear it all  Well may they speak That Francis that first time And that long festal year at Fontainebleau I surely then could sometimes leave the ground Put on the glory Rafaels daily wear In that humane great monarchs golden look  One finger in his beard or twisted curl Over his mouths good mark that made the smile One arm about my shoulder round my neck The jingle of his gold chain in my ear I painting proudly with his breath on me All his court round him seeing with his eyes Such frank French eyes and such a fire of souls Profuse my hand kept plying by those hearts  And best of all this this this face beyond This in the background waiting on my work To crown the issue with a last reward A good time was it not my kingly days And had you not grown restless    but I know  Tis done and past twas right my instinct said Too live the life grew golden and not grey And Im the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt Out of the grange whose four walls make his world  How could it end in any other way You called me and I came home to your heart  The triumph was to reach and stay there since I reached it ere the triumph what is lost Let my hands frame your face in your hairs gold You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine Rafael did this Andrea painted that The Romans is the better when you pray But still the others Virgin was his wife  Men will excuse me  I am glad to judge Both pictures in your presence clearer grows My better fortune I resolve to think  For do you know Lucrezia as God lives Said one day Agnolo his very self To Rafael       I have known it all these years       When the young man was flaming out his thoughts Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see Too lifted up in heart because of it Friend theres a certain sorry little scrub Goes up and down our Florence none cares how Who were he set to plan and execute As you are pricked on by your popes and kings Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours To Rafaels And indeed the arm is wrong  I hardly dare       yet only you to see Give the chalk here quick thus the line should go Ay but the soul hes Rafael rub it out Still all I care for if he spoke the truth What he why who but Michel Agnolo Do you forget already words like those If really there was such a chance so lost  Is whether youre not grateful but more pleased  Well let me think so  And you smile indeed This hour has been an hour Another smile If you would sit thus by me every night I should work better do you comprehend I mean that I should earn more give you more  See it is settled dusk now theres a star Morellos gone the watch-lights show the wall The cue-owls speak the name we call them by  Come from the window love come in at last Inside the melancholy little house We built to be so gay with  God is just  King Francis may forgive me oft at nights When I look up from painting eyes tired out The walls become illumined brick from brick Distinct instead of mortar fierce bright gold That gold of his I did cement them with Let us but love each other  Must you go That Cousin here again he waits outside Must see you you and not with me Those loans More gaming debts to pay you smiled for that Well let smiles buy me have you more to spend While hand and eye and something of a heart Are left me works my ware and whats it worth Ill pay my fancy  Only let me sit The grey remainder of the evening out Idle you call it and muse perfectly How I could paint were I but back in France One picture just one more the Virgins face Not yours this time I want you at my side To hear them that is Michel Agnolo  Judge all I do and tell you of its worth  Will you To-morrow satisfy your friend  I take the subjects for his corridor Finish the portrait out of hand there there And throw him in another thing or two If he demurs the whole should prove enough To pay for this same Cousins freak  Beside Whats better and whats all I care about Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff Love does that please you Ah but what does he The Cousin what does he to please you more I am grown peaceful as old age to-night  I regret little I would change still less  Since there my past life lies why alter it The very wrong to Francis it is true I took his coin was tempted and complied And built this house and sinned and all is said  My father and my mother died of want  Well had I riches of my own you see How one gets rich Let each one bear his lot  They were born poor lived poor and poor they died And I have laboured somewhat in my time And not been paid profusely  Some good son Paint my two hundred pictures let him try No doubt theres something strikes a balance  Yes You loved me quite enough  it seems to-night  This must suffice me here  What would one have In heaven perhaps new chances one more chance  Four great walls in the New Jerusalem Meted on each side by the angels reed For Leonard Rafael Agnolo and me To cover the three first without a wife While I have mine So still they overcome Because theres still Lucrezia as I choose  Again the Cousins whistle Go my Love
