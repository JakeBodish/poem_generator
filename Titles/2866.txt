
History cant be rushed 
We didnt have time to see the village
we didnt have time to see the house fall
to build light out of mud
nor did we see time burning 
The city is missing
and weve saved others
our backs turned 
What happened
is a different reality in everyones mind
but the direction we took
tells us the world doesnt end
when we force air out of bones 
Now we know the myth
by the cup of coffee going cold
realize we were never told
how to take
the street parallel to our heart
