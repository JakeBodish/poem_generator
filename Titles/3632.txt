
Right now Im sipping a mango lassi
in Action Town  Im not bereft at all  In fact
Im pleasantly aware of people moving on all fours 
Our voice and text messages will
be erased in no time  When I walk into stores
they call me Spark Plug because I have a sparky manner 
Things get all wavy from their constant attention 
Its going to be okay  Im a good habit
you dont need to trick me 
Im not sure where I should put my hands
when I walk down the street with you 
Its funny to think about who I would
call if something really awful happened 
Id be jumping up and down not knowing who to call 
My way of doing things is scary even to me 
Remember the toothbrush the honey bear
and the meal that we thought would never end
Im counting on you to come through high water
to come through chaos and to Action Town
where well lift our aces to skyward aviation
