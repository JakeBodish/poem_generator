
After youve been to bed together for the first time
without the advantage or disadvantage of any prior acquaintance
the other party very often says to you
Tell me about yourself I want to know all about you
whats your story And you think maybe they really and truly do
sincerely want to know your life story and so you light up
a cigarette and begin to tell it to them the two of you
lying together in completely relaxed positions
like a pair of rag dolls a bored child dropped on a bed 
You tell them your story or as much of your story
as time or a fair degree of prudence allows and they say
       Oh oh oh oh oh
each time a little more faintly until the oh
is just an audible breath and then of course
theres some interruption  Slow room service comes up
with a bowl of melting ice cubes or one of you rises to pee
and gaze at himself with the mild astonishment in the bathroom mirror 
And then the first thing you know before youve had time
to pick up where you left off with your enthralling life story
theyre telling you their life story exactly as theyd intended to all along
and youre saying Oh oh oh oh oh
each time a little more faintly the vowel at last becoming
no more than an audible sigh
as the elevator halfway down the corridor and a turn to the left
draws one last long deep breath of exhaustion
and stops breathing forever  Then
Well one of you falls asleep
and the other one does likewise with a lighted cigarette in his mouth
and thats how people burn to death in hotel rooms
