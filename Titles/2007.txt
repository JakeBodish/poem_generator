
My love is as a fever longing stillFor that which longer nurseth the diseaseFeeding on that which doth preserve the illTh’ uncertain sickly appetite to please My reason the physician to my loveAngry that his prescriptions are not kept Hath left me and I desperate now approveDesire is death which physic did except Past cure I am now reason is past care And frantic-mad with evermore unrestMy thoughts and my discourse as madmen’s areAt random from the truth vainly expressed    For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright    Who art as black as hell as dark as night
