There is a house in me  It is empty  I empty it 
 
Negative space the only native emptiness there is 
There is

An alarm goes off  It goes on and on  When the alarm
drifts to different parts of the room
 
I realize that alarm is the sun

And there is no one who does not need
 
never an empty seat  And the blind one
 
he does not find a place  There is a god in him
helping him to need himself

A mother sticks a spoon into my chest
which is an empty bowl actually
 
so the spoon lands quickly
and loudly  Heartbreak in the heart she says 
 
When you love someone
more than you’ve ever known you could it is
a good thing except for the terrifying
 
realization that one day there comes
a parting
