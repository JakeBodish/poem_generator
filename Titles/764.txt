
First day of February
and in the far corner of the yard
the Adirondack chair
blown over by the wind at Christmas
is still on its back
the snow too deep for me
to traipse out and right it
the ice too sheer
to risk slamming these old bones
to the ground 
In a hospital bed in her room
where her bed used to be
and her husband
my Aunt Millie keeps reaching up
for the far corner of the room
whispering That is so interesting I will go now 
In April
I will walk out
across the warming grass
and right the chair
as if there had never been anything
to stop me in the first place
listening for the buzz of hummingbirds
which reminds me of how fast
things are capable of moving
