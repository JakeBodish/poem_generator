
Acorn-brown the girls new nipples
draw the young mens rooster eyes
where a woman is fitting a man to her mouth   
breathing fire holding for dear life 
Green almonds in their shells
she knifes them open one at a time and   
hands him a slick teardrop cool white   
tasting cool white  Nothing
compares with such austerities although   
the skulls honeycomb of bone
will break their hearts who need hearts   
like a birds wishbone to bend unbend
at every feathery beat wishbone hearts
or something fleet and light as an ostrichs   
leg-bone bearing him to where panicked   
with grief he can bury his head in sand Papyrus light a scarf with black parrots on it   
lifts in the breeze and a real rare bird
is about to fly his head in the clouds his life   
shrouded in daylight he keeps breaking
