
It should have a womans name
something to tell us how the green skirt of land
                                           has bound its hips 
When the day lowers its vermilion tapestry over the west ridge
the water has the sound of leaves shaken in a sack
and the childs voice that you have heard below
                                                          sings of the sea 
By slow movements of the earths crust
or is it that her hip bones have been shaped
by a fault of engineering
Some coquetry cycles this blue edge
a spring ready to come forth to correct
                                    loves mathematics 
Saturday rises immaculately 
The waters jade edge plays against corn-colored
picnic baskets rose and lemon bottles red balloons
dancers in purple tights a roan mare out of its field 
It is not the moment to think of Bahia
and the gray mother with her water explanation 
Not far from here the city a mass of swift water
in its own depression licks its sores 
Still I would be eased by reasons 
Sand dunes in drifts 
Lava cuts its own bed at a mountain base 
Blindness enters where the light refuses to go 
In Loch Lomond the water flowers with algae
and a small life has taken the name of a star 
You will hear my star-slow heart
empty itself with a light-swift pitch
where the water thins to a silence 
And the woman who will not be named
screams in the birth of her fading away
