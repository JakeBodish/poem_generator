
There isn’t a word for walking out of the grocery storewith a gallon jug of milk in a plastic sack that should have been bagged in double layers so that before you are even out the dooryou feel the weight of the jug dragging the bag down stretching the thinplastic handles longer and longerand you know it’s only a matter of time untilbottom suddenly splits  There is no single unimpeachable word for that vague sensation of somethingmoving away from youas it exceeds its elastic capacity         which is too bad because that is the wordI would like to use to describe standing on the streetchatting with an old friend as the awareness grows in me that he isno longer a friend but only an acquaintance a person with whom I never made the effort until this moment when as we say goodbye I think we share a feeling of relief  a recognition that we have reachedthe end of a pretense   though to tell the truth what I already am thinking aboutis my gratitude for language how it will stretch just so much and no fartherhow there are some holes it will not cover uphow it will move if not inside then around the circumference of almost anything how over the years it has given meback all the hours and days all the plodding love and faith all themisunderstandings and secretsI have willingly poured into it
