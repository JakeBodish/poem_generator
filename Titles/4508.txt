
I sang all night for you but you didn’t care  You were too sad  Little bird  I said to myself you can’t bring anybody back but maybe you can keep him here  I thought you liked my song  But I couldn’t tell now  You looked angry but you stayed in the room where I sang  I inherited the song  Not from my parents  Not from my grandmother  My grandfather doesn’t sing  My song was mine and I thought you liked it  I thought you loved me  Now you showed no sign of loving anything  But you stayed in the room all night  The room was full of statues with coins under their tongues  I felt bad for building them  Some don’t even have names  Sylvia Ian Anne Emily Seb  You barely moved  Sometimes you moved  Little bird I told myself little bird pretending I was you I love you  Please sing for me  I didn’t want you to leave   I kept singing
