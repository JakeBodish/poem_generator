
do you remember the first time you were called annoyinghow your breath stopped short in your chestthe way the light drained from your eyes though you knew your cheeks were ablazethe way your throat tightened as you tried to form an argument that got lost on your tongueyour eyes never left the floor that day you were 13 you’re 20 now and i still see the light fade from your eyes when you talk about your interests for “too long”apologies littering every other sentencewords trailing off a cliff you haven’t jumped from in 7 years i could listen to you forever though i know speaking for more than 3 uninterrupted minutes makes you anxious all i want you to know is that you deserve to be heardfor 3 minutesfor 10 minutesfor 2 hours forever there will be people who cannot handle your grace your beauty your wisdom your heartmostly because they can’t handle their own  but you will never beand have never been“too much ”
