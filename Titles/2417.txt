
Model prisoner or not I wont Silver lash hounds toothmeager sinful towns crook 
I am nervous again  I could kill
if you let me  But tonight Ill be still
under this palm  Zeroed out
the tea my toilet muck 
Licorice and almond
twisted beneath the sink
Im lovely again  Come on
with my dying 
Today the globes underside
isnt pink but rather
I look ahead toward what
has happened
