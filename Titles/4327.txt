Had this body been madeof nothing
but its bright skeleton  autumn-
blown skinI would shut my eyes
into butterfly wingson a mapped earth  Had the gods
even their own gods I could re-
learn the very shapeof my face in a puddle of sky-
colored rain  Extinction isto the hands
as the lips areto the first gesture
the tongue carves into the slick mouth
just beforeprayer  In every way
the world failsto light the soft inner
machine  marrowof the bones in motion   I imagine
smudging my tongue along a walllike the chest
I dare to plunge in-to the Braille of every node
blooming outas if the first day-
light of winteredsnowfall  This night   
like any fleshed boy I dreamof a lyre strung
with the torn hair of hímiin in place
of my dried mouth   thereit is  Whispers
in the blue-black dark after c’álalalc’álalal reach outtoward my teeth to strum
this wilting instrument  once awake I’m holding
its frame to builda window back in-
to the world  Had this body
been held after allthese years I would enter
you to find my frozen self
 touch  Like the gutted animalwe take
in offering   live
