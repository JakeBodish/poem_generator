northern triangle First I lived near mud there I carved some things  Then I found a well yo soy un bicho migrante  I had to climb trees find mollusks made a knife to eat them raw  Later later-later I worried about firewood pots to cook  I asked ¿Where did my parents go ¿Where ¿There I walked to another tree another shore     ¿Where are they now I carved more my face my parents’ an alligator’s yo soy un bicho migrante  ¡But no I got tired of waiting of playing I wanted to see more  I found a river found a road  Found more like me a bunch of us waiting for more of us to flee  A tribe  A small village yo soy un bicho migrante  I saw there were rules clothes kept dry in plastic bags phone numbers written inside pants  They also made fire carved things into the mud  Asked ¿De donde sos vos I pointed de allá  Said I didn’t have plans  They answered ¡Bienvenido Tapped their feet on the dirt yo soy un bicho migrante  We walked on the road then along the road looking for food  Through the forest through the mountains we looked for mud for frogs for ¡There ¡There they are We played our favorite game until I got bored again  Yo soy un bicho migrante  Nights are boring  Fireflies     boring  Stars the moon     Well     I began to let myself think     babosadas came to mind countries passports  Then I walked away from everyone got to a mountain then another one  Got to a river where I saw rats  ¿Have you seen the tribe ¿A savage bunch that makes fires from trash In a hurry they chased after me  I ran north  Found a few others  Or maybe it was just me  To eat you have to believe they said  Handed me something in the dark  Yo soy un bicho migrante  Saw pizza in the dark hamburgers clouds maybe  Maybe clouds  I saw fireflies  Few days had passed  I felt like an empty road  I invented machines  Planes  Fast cars  I barely had time to learn their names  I barely had time to say goodbye  Yo soy un bicho migrante  Years later I filled forms  Wrote my name  woke up in a bed that had traveled 56 days 56 nights  Then came an election  War  Kids kept coming but I had to find work  Wrote so many books my hands got tired  Made alternatives for plastic  Someone separated people into groups  Trees were cut extinct  But I destroyed fences jailed kings invented a replacement for countries  We searched for  purpose  Happiness  ¡Anyone could travel anywhere We learned new languages  I had looked through the window I wasn’t supposed to  Yes I looked  ¿What can I say So I could be certain I looked  broke through  Yo soy un bicho migrante  But maybe just maybe I’ll return to that well  begin carving mud again  I’ll carve the whole world backwards  But no  Maybe not  Migrating has no beginning  No purpose  Yo solo soy uno de muchos bichos migrantes
