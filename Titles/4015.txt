I want to get a handle on your homeopathic incontinent waysbecause I think you may be onto something  Firstly what kind of fox
are you that approaches the shore no hen house to bother no bramblesto scoff No line of emerald shit to booby-trap the garden with
Perhaps wherever we are you are so why not the beach What promisedid the salt ocean offer you or appear to Cured meat Fish After all
once a month I know I reek gloriously of kelp   salt and iron and yeast   an umami feast for the brave or weak  Or were you worrying seabirds
up on the cliff   stopped in your tracks unable to resist  A little splish The wind threshing your water as it fell   yellow scattered one or two
drops of which maybe reached  Or perhaps you were caught shortcoy on the beach and entered the surf for decorum’s sake  All over
the world miles from the sea girls caught between poor sanitaryprovision and a social imperative to be discreet ﬁnd themselves
in a dark place their skirts about their waists  Maybe it wasthe king’s men that saw ﬁt to drive you into the sea  But clever
resourceful you just thumbed your nose and learned to swim Paddled to safer land much like we once did  Your charcoal paws
doggedly turning the cold pages of the sea  Pausing now and thento pee a comforting cloud of heat  And which child among us hasn’t
cast their blessing on the waves Sent into the surf  by mothers which of ushasn’t rightfully claimed the ocean as our own or in turn been claimed
