
Someone is looking for us 
I sensed it earlier at the creek
while floating on my back and again
on Route 8 near Brookline 
So we’ve detoured to this hillside
eroding and crazy with markers 
We’re looking for row mm or nn
or something like that 
I lug the baby my wife runs ahead 
This neighborhood knows her–
she passes so easily between stones 
She finds the grave her father
dead ten years now  In the time it takes
to say kaddish the sun’s dropped 
I set down my son
and he crawls in the dimness
pulling himself up on the headstone 
How delicately he fingers the marble 
Quickly he rounds its corner  Vanishes 
I’m thinking grass stone quiet–
then babbling from another world
