
I can only give you back what you imagine I am a soulless man  When I take you into my mouth it is not my mouth  It isan unlit pit an aperture opened just enoughin the pinhole camera to capture the shade I have caused you to rise up to me and Ihave watched as you rose and waned Our times together have been innumerable  Stilllike a Capistrano swallow you come back You understand I understand you  Understandeach jiggle and tug  Your pudgy mercurial wad I am simply a hand inexhaustible as yours could never be  You’re nevertheless prepared to shoot If I could I’d finish you  Be more than just your rag
