
put yr cup on my tray
the stewardess said 40000
feet up  well i’ve
never done it that way  what
have i got to lose 
i climb into a cab  the
woman driver is singing
along with Frank Sinatra
“how was your flight coming in”
another one  these americans
only one thing on their
minds
