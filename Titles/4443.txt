
I close my eyes and see him windmilling his arms as he plummets from
the Mystic Tobin Bridge to prove me wrong to show me he was good
to atone for sins like seeds in the lopsided apple of his heart but mostly
to escape from me in the back of his cab a Puerto Rican lawyer in a suit and tie 
I hated the 111 bus sweltering in my suit and tie with the crowd in the aisle
waiting to hit a bump on the Mystic Tobin Bridge so my head would finally
burst through the ceiling like a giraffe on a circus train  I hated the 111 bus
after eviction day in Chelsea District Court translating the landlords and judges
into Spanish so the tenants knew they had to stuff their clothing into garbage
bags and steal away again away from the 40-watt squint that followed them
everywhere that followed me because I stood beside them in court  I would
daydream in the humidity of the bus a basketball hero flipping the balled-up
pages of the law into the wastebasket at the office as the legal aid lawyers
chanted my name  I hated the 111 bus  I had to take a taxicab that day What the hell you doing here said the driver of the cab to me in my suit
and tie  You gotta be careful in this neighborhood  There’s a lotta Josésaround here  The driver’s great-grandfather staggered off a boat so his
great-grandson could one day drive me across the Mystic Tobin Bridge
but there was no room in the taxi for chalk and a blackboard  He could
hear the sawing of my breath as I leaned into his ear past the bulletproof
barricade somehow missing and said I’m a José  I could see the 40-watt
squint in his rearview mirror  I’m Puerto Rican I said  It was exactly
5 pm and we were stuck in traffic in a taxi on the Mystic Tobin Bridge 
The driver stammered his own West Side Story without the ballet
how a Puerto Rican gang stole his cousin’s wallet years ago  You think
I’m gonna rob you
