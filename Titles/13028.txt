waterlily The green-sheathed daffodilly Tremble in the water chilly        Round about Shalott  Willows whiten aspens shiver  The sunbeam showers break and quiver In the stream that runneth ever By the island in the river        Flowing down to Camelot  Four gray walls and four gray towers Overlook a space of flowers And the silent isle imbowers        The Lady of Shalott  Underneath the bearded barley The reaper reaping late and early Hears her ever chanting cheerly Like an angel singing clearly        Oer the stream of Camelot  Piling the sheaves in furrows airy Beneath the moon the reaper weary Listening whispers  Tis the fairy        Lady of Shalott  The little isle is all inraild With a rose-fence and overtraild With roses by the marge unhaild The shallop flitteth silken saild        Skimming down to Camelot  A pearl garland winds her head She leaneth on a velvet bed Full royally apparelled        The Lady of Shalott  Part II No time hath she to sport and play A charmed web she weaves alway  A curse is on her if she stay Her weaving either night or day        To look down to Camelot  She knows not what the curse may be Therefore she weaveth steadily Therefore no other care hath she        The Lady of Shalott  She lives with little joy or fear  Over the water running near The sheepbell tinkles in her ear  Before her hangs a mirror clear        Reflecting towerd Camelot  And as the mazy web she whirls She sees the surly village churls And the red cloaks of market girls        Pass onward from Shalott  Sometimes a troop of damsels glad An abbot on an ambling pad Sometimes a curly shepherd lad Or long-haird page in crimson clad        Goes by to towerd Camelot And sometimes thro the mirror blue The knights come riding two and two She hath no loyal knight and true        The Lady of Shalott  But in her web she still delights To weave the mirrors magic sights For often thro the silent nights A funeral with plumes and lights        And music came from Camelot Or when the moon was overhead Came two young lovers lately wed I am half sick of shadows said        The Lady of Shalott  Part III A bow-shot from her bower-eaves He rode between the barley-sheaves The sun came dazzling thro the leaves And flamd upon the brazen greaves        Of bold Sir Lancelot  A red-cross knight for ever kneeld To a lady in his shield That sparkled on the yellow field        Beside remote Shalott  The gemmy bridle glitterd free Like to some branch of stars we see Hung in the golden Galaxy  The bridle bells rang merrily        As he rode down from Camelot And from his blazond baldric slung A mighty silver bugle hung And as he rode his armour rung        Beside remote Shalott  All in the blue unclouded weather Thick-jewelld shone the saddle-leather The helmet and the helmet-feather Burnd like one burning flame together        As he rode down from Camelot  As often thro the purple night Below the starry clusters bright Some bearded meteor trailing light        Moves over green Shalott  His broad clear brow in sunlight glowd On burnishd hooves his war-horse trode From underneath his helmet flowd His coal-black curls as on he rode        As he rode down from Camelot  From the bank and from the river He flashd into the crystal mirror Tirra lirra tirra lirra        Sang Sir Lancelot  She left the web she left the loom She made three paces thro the room She saw the water-flower bloom She saw the helmet and the plume        She lookd down to Camelot  Out flew the web and floated wide The mirror crackd from side to side The curse is come upon me cried        The Lady of Shalott  Part IV In the stormy east-wind straining The pale yellow woods were waning The broad stream in his banks complaining Heavily the low sky raining        Over towerd Camelot Outside the isle a shallow boat Beneath a willow lay afloat Below the carven stern she wrote        The Lady of Shalott  A cloudwhite crown of pearl she dight All raimented in snowy white That loosely flew her zone in sight Claspd with one blinding diamond bright        Her wide eyes fixd on Camelot Though the squally east-wind keenly Blew with folded arms serenely By the water stood the queenly        Lady of Shalott  With a steady stony glance  Like some bold seer in a trance Beholding all his own mischance Mute with a glassy countenance         She lookd down to Camelot  It was the closing of the day She loosd the chain and down she lay The broad stream bore her far away        The Lady of Shalott  As when to sailors while they roam By creeks and outfalls far from home Rising and dropping with the foam From dying swans wild warblings come        Blown shoreward so to Camelot Still as the boathead wound along The willowy hills and fields among They heard her chanting her deathsong        The Lady of Shalott  A longdrawn carol mournful holy She chanted loudly chanted lowly Till her eyes were darkend wholly And her smooth face sharpend slowly        Turnd to towerd Camelot For ere she reachd upon the tide The first house by the water-side Singing in her song she died        The Lady of Shalott  Under tower and balcony By garden wall and gallery A pale pale corpse she floated by Deadcold between the houses high        Dead into towerd Camelot  Knight and burgher lord and dame To the planked wharfage came Below the stern they read her name        The Lady of Shalott  They crossd themselves their stars they blest Knight minstrel abbot squire and guest  There lay a parchment on her breast That puzzled more than all the rest        The wellfed wits at Camelot  The web was woven curiously The charm is broken utterly Draw near and fear not this is I        The Lady of Shalott
