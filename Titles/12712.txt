You charmd me not with that fair face       Though it was all divine To be anothers is the grace       That makes me wish you mine     The Gods and Fortune take their part       Who like young monarchs fight And boldly dare invade that heart       Which is anothers right     First mad with hope we undertake       To pull up every bar But once possessd we faintly make       A dull defensive war     Now every friend is turnd a foe       In hope to get our store And passion makes us cowards grow       Which made us brave before
