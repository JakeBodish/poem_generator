
We got sent home early no one knew why  I think weare at war I yelled to my sisterknapsacks ringing
against our backs  I copy-catted from Frances
who whispered it when the teachersgot silent  Can’t blame
me for taking a good idea I collect words where I find them 
I’m young  no one aroundknows where my parents are from  
A map on our wall  I circle allthe places I want to be  My auntie
not-blood but could beruns the oil through my scalp  
Her fingers play the strands of my hair The house smells like badam  
My uncle not-blood but could besoaks them in a bowl of water  
My auntie says my people mightbe Afghani  I draw a ship on the map 
I write Afghani under its hull  I countall the oceans blood  not-blood
all the people I could bethe whole map my mirror 
The kids at school ask me where I’m from  I have no answer 
I’m a silent girl a rig ready to blow  The towers fell two weeks
ago  I can’t say blow out loud or everyone will hate me 
They all make English their own say that’s the bomb 
I know that word’s not meant for me but I collect words
where I find them  I practice at night the crater
it makes of my mouth  I whisper it to my sheetsbombbombbombbombbombbombbombbombbombbombbombbombbomb
a little symphony so round  I look up  make sure no one heard
