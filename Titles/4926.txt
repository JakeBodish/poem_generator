
Whatever the cost I pay up at the minnow pools I don’t know anything of the misery of these trapped fishor the failure of the marsh I’m so hidden Up above is the island with its few houses facingthe ocean God walks with anyone there  I oftenslosh through the low tide to a sisterunattached to causeways It’s where deer mate then lead their youngby my house to fields again up above me Pray for me  Like myself be lost An amulet under your chest a green sign of the firstrose you ever saw the first shore Then I wash my horse dogs me behind the barn Only the narrow way leads home
