
In zero cold the engines slow
to turn over coughing
awake like my father sitting on the edge
of the bed staring at the blue linoleum floor
coughing again lifting his heavy body
into another day on the railroad section gang
the icy wind through Lehigh Gap blasting
down on him as he raises the sledge hammer
and strains against the crowbar 
But now hes drinking coffee
looking toward the dark window
thinking of what
Maybe watching Friday Night Fights
or ordering tomato seeds
maybe the ghostly face in the window
staring back at him
