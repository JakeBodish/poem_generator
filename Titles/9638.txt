Meryon saw it coming who was he
No people so no noise  As it should be 
The Bridge  The Morgue  Ghostly round his bed
Antipodean atolls and tattoos had fluted
Volcanoes puffed  Then borborygmic sea
Forked at its last gasp into a V
Down that black gallery and backward slid
A syrup foul ovum and sperm concocted
The foggy groan of Antichrist  1863
People mattered nothing live or dead 
Paris by his impeccable etchings emptied
Pointy turrets windows not a single head
Poking out and there across the sky
Tortuous the skeleton birds creak by

As if all the steps had stopped
As if all the takes had token
As if all the creaks had croaken
As if all that weeps had wopped
As if all that flips had flopped
As if all that mocks had moaken
As if all that speaks had spoken
As if all that drips had dropped
As if all that hopes had hopped
As if all that leaps had lopped
As if all that aches had oaken
As if all that peaks had poken
As if all that creeps had cropped
As if all that peeps had popped

The old aquaforte art is back thought Baudelaire 
Multiple majesty of stone piled on stone
Obelisks of industry discharge into the air
Their coalescent smoke  Almost airborne
Scaffoldings roped to monuments under repair 
Very poetic beauty so paradoxicalI never saw the like
                        and the sky over it all Eagles  Tumult  Perspective deepens thereWith all the dramas that have come and gone 
The artist Once a sailor now he’ll seek
In nooks of masonry a sphinx 
                            I think you’d get a scare
To hear him talk
