Three moons in the skythe night they found himdrowned in Sawtan’s Bogjust his cap sitting thereand his wee fat hands poking out It was no loss to the village I told them next morningand the villagers agreed  Horn-daft he washavering and glaikitand scaring the children I mind that timehe picked up a mouseand ate it quick in two mouthfulsset the tail asideon the groundlike a cocktail stick I used her well after thathis Jenniestill in her widow’s weedsgilping into herwhenever I couldin the barn or the boathouseor off in the fields She slipped two or three out at leastand sank each one in a lobster creel Her head was awayby the end as mad as her manand no good to me She sleeps now under Beinn Ruadhainn her face covered in ivy scab and sticky-willow The dreams came then Last night the burning loch so full of bairnsthey bobbed to the surface with their hair on fireblack snow fingers coming through the floorboardsrain like razor bladesthe foosty-faced man there at every cornerhands furred with grey-mould And her as always star-naked hatchingin the herring-nets The last I remember was my body being drivenwith sticks through the townto Sawtan’s Brae and hanged I broke from sleep and sat up sweating dream-fleyed in the dark I groped around for the matchesand the matches were put in my hand
