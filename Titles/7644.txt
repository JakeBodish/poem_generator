
I am writing this on a strip of white birch bark
that I cut from a tree with a penknife 
There is no other way to express adequately
the immensity of the clouds that are passing over the farms   
and wooded lakes of Ontario and the endless visibility   
that hands you the horizon on a platter 
I am also writing this in a wooden canoe
a point of balance in the middle of Lake Couchiching   
resting the birch bark against my knees    
I can feel the sun’s hands on my bare back   
but I am thinking of winter
snow piled up in all the provinces
and the solemnity of the long grain-ships
that pass the cold months moored at Owen Sound 
O Canada as the anthem goes
scene of my boyhood summers
you are the pack of Sweet Caporals on the table   
you are the dove-soft train whistle in the night
you are the empty chair at the end of an empty dock    
You are the shelves of books in a lakeside cottage   Gift from the Sea by Anne Morrow Lindbergh   A Child’s Garden of Verses by Robert Louis Stevenson   Anne of Avonlea by L  M  MontgomerySo You’re Going to Paris by Clara E  Laughlin
and Peril Over the Airport one
of the Vicky Barr Flight Stewardess series
by Helen Wills whom some will remember
as the author of the Cherry Ames Nurse stories 
What has become of the languorous girls
who would pass the long limp summer evenings readingCherry Ames Student Nurse Cherry Ames Senior Nurse
