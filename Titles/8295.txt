
When I see a couple of kids
And guess he’s fucking her and she’s   
Taking pills or wearing a diaphragm   
I know this is paradise
Everyone old has dreamed of all their lives    
Bonds and gestures pushed to one side
Like an outdated combine harvester
And everyone young going down the long slide
To happiness endlessly  I wonder if   
Anyone looked at me forty years back   
And thought That’ll be the life
No God any more or sweating in the dark
