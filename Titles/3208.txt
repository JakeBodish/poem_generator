
Who needs to be at peace in the world It helps to be between wars to die
a  few  times  each day to understand your fathers sky as you take it apart
piece  by  piece  and cant feel  anything  cant  feel the tree growing under
your feet the eyes poking night only to find another night to compare it to 
Whoever   heard   of   turning   pain   into   hummingbirds   or   red  birds 
havent  we  grown  What  does  it mean to be older  Maybe a house with-
out  doors  can  still  survive  a  storm  Maybe I cant find the proper way to
rebel  or  damn it  I cant  leave   I want to  but you grow inside of me  And
as  I  watch   you  before  I  know  it  Im  too  heavy  too full  of  you  to  move 
Maybe  thats what they meant when they said you shouldnt love a country
too much
