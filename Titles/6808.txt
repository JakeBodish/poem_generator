
Soldiers are citizens of deaths grey land
Drawing no dividend from times to-morrows    
In the great hour of destiny they stand
Each with his feuds and jealousies and sorrows    
Soldiers are sworn to action they must win   
Some flaming fatal climax with their lives 
Soldiers are dreamers when the guns begin
They think of firelit homes clean beds and wives 
I see them in foul dug-outs gnawed by rats
And in the ruined trenches lashed with rain   
Dreaming of things they did with balls and bats
And mocked by hopeless longing to regain   
Bank-holidays and picture shows and spats
And going to the office in the train
