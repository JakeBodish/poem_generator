
Like the horn you played in Catholic school
the city will open its mouth and cry
out  Dont worry bout nothing  Dont meanno thing  It will leave you stunned
as a fighter with his eyes swelled shut
whos told he won the whole damn purse 
It will feel better than any floor
thats risen up to meet you  It will rise
like Easter bread golden and familiar
in your grandmothers hands  Shell come back
heaven having been too far from home
to hold her  O it will be beautiful 
Every girl will ask you to dance and the boys
wont kill you for it  Shake your head 
Dance until your bones clatter  What a prize
you are  What a lucky sack of stars
