
Hot hot hot you are hot Sun
Glaring all over my east window
Burning beaming yellowing
The room  Uninterested in me
Because Im not Mayakovsky
Although I feel you insistingI wake that I produce right now
Or perish as my uncle used to say 
Brave Mayakovsky doomed Mayakovsky He could sass you and later OHara
Before they turned forty both gone
Sassed you and sassed Mayakovsky too 
But when I try I know its just another
Instance of me whistling in the dark
Me not blazing me not burning out
