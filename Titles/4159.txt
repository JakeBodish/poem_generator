
I keep returning to John Constable’s Study of Clouds Oil on cardboard
six by seven and a half inches it shows purple-graythunderheads
one patch of blue above low hills and two small trees flanked by shrubsin the left
foreground  A sketch en plein air a half hour’s worth of work at mostit catches
exactly one scrap of sky and shifting sunlight on a blusteryday in 1820 
The year King George the Third died in Windsor Castle blindand insane the year
50000 Scottish weavers went on strike and printed a proclamationcalling for a new
“provisional government ” Their leaders were caught hanged and thendecapitated
for good measure  This cloud study survived that history Two minutes later
the clouds would have taken on a different cast of light and shapejust like the thunderheads
now piling up above the Liffey  I hobble out of the Dublin City Gallerytake a bus to the river
sit on a park bench with a ziplock bag of ice on my swollen knee  Its wet coldmakes the joint
ache  My body is breaking down bone spur under the right kneecap At fifty-eight
I watch young men and women in black sweats run along the River Liffey  Abha na Life
Anna Liffey river that crosses the plains of Life  I envy them Once I too could run
over the asphalt almost without knowing I inhabited a bodywhose knees might seize up
and swell  I will not run again in this life  Cirrus and cumulonimbusscud across the blue
escutcheon of sky  Sun’s blazon through rain rampant my life is a cloud studyfor some larger landscape
John Constable never got around to painting  It hangs in a gilded frame People stare at it
before passing on to more important canvases to Renoir’sLes Parapluies women
and men opening shiny black umbrellas in a Paris park There a mother shelters
her two daughters under an umbrella meant for one The younger daughter
holds a wooden hoop she has been rolling along tamped dirt pathswhipping it with a stick
to keep it spinning before the rain settled in  Renoir paintedthis small family
in his lush impressionistic style  Five years later after visitingItaly and studying
Piero della Francesca’s frescoes he came back and finished the paintingin his new “manière aigre”
or harsh style  He handled the gray silk folds of the auburn-haired woman’s dresson the left as if they were
granite to be sculpted  She carries a market basket filledto the brim with shadow 
To approach old age one needs a new harsher style  Here by the Liffeymothers push screaming
infants in strollers  Five teenagers in blue jeans and bright yellow or green raincoatswalk by joking texting
on cell phones smoking  One girl and her boy hang back embrace French-kissa long ten seconds 
Another boy shouts over his shoulder “Get a room” A pairof mute swans
preens and swims down the River Liffey whose amber waters mirrorhow the clouds pass
avalanche of cumulus that hangs forever on the burnishedunrippling surface
of my memory   vast sky surf cloud after cloud cresting breakingto be washed
away to blue nothing  Each of us   lovers mothers runners me   no morethan windblown swansdown
