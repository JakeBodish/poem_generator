
This is the deepest part of the world 
Bird don’t fly herebut there is the sound of wings 
The smell just a struggle in the earthunderneath the musty floorboards 
Monsters hatch fully-grown from their eggs Snaky legs indicate chaos 
I carry sad omens
slobber down the psychic’s legsto her feet pointed backwards 
I roll off the back of a skull strapped on topof a fox who shape-shifts into the irresistible 
A Christian Oklahoma-shaped and melancholiccaught at the entrance of a ditch
as the best breath of me tornadoes into the next county
