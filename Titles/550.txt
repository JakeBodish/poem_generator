
I wanted to have a poem and I was pregnant  I was very thin  As if I’d lived on air  A poet must be able to live on air but a mother must not attempt it  My mother wanted me to buy a set of matching pots Wearever aluminum like the ones she had  They were heavy and had well fitting lids so my suppers wouldn’t burn  My husband wanted me to give dinner parties  John F  Kennedy was running for office 
 
I sensed danger  Kennedy wasn’t against the Bomb or for nuclear disarmament  I joined SANE at its inception  Also Concerned Scientists  I spoke with Linus Pauling and encouraged my husband to help his partner organize Physicians for Social Responsibility 
 
There was a baby in my belly  I wanted to write poems  I had a crazy idea that a woman could write a real novel the kind that shook the world  I hallucinated that a woman could be a poet but she would have to be free  I couldn’t imagine that freedom for myself even though I could see it in Isla Negra when I followed Pablo Neruda  I could see it in the way he walked  Even if he were walking inside a dictatorship among guns soldiers and spies there was nothing between him and his vision  Anything he saw he was able to take into himself–there was no sight no image no vision to which he didn’t feel entitled  In his heart everything–everything–belonged to him  Pablo Neruda was–more than anything–a poet and so he was an entitled man 
 
I was a woman and entitled to nothing  I had nothing except a husband a rented house a set of pots living room furniture a frenzy of obligations credit cards anxious relatives too many acquaintances a gift of future diaper service two telephones no time to read a plastic wrapped cookbook of recipes gleaned from the pages of the New York Times and a hunger a terrible hunger for the unimaginable unlimited freedom of being a poet and a baby in my belly 
 
I would have called Pablo long distance if I had the courage if I had the ability to speak Spanish fluently if we had ever talked about real things  But what would a man know about a baby in the belly And what did it matter if there were to be one poet more or less in the world when so many in his country were dying
 
I woke up one morning and thought–I can’t have this child  My husband said “You’ll have to get a job after it’s born so we can buy a house  You’ll need an advanced degree so you can do something ” I thought I can’t  I have to write poems  My mother found a crib  Someone painted it white  A friend sent a pastel mobile with tame wood animals  I thought about blue curtains making bedspreads and abortions 
 
Pablo was silent  He was walking so far from me I couldn’t hear him  My husband objected to donating more free medical care to the Black Panthers  I tried to make dolmades from scratch and located grape leaves preserved in brine at the Boys’ Market twenty miles away  I organized a write-in campaign for peace to challenge JFK  My husband thought it would be nice to have teatime with the children and romantic dinners by ourselves  The new formula bottles lined up on the sink like tiny bombs  The U S  was pursuing over ground testing I was afraid the radiation would cross the milk barrier  I had a poem in me howling for real life but no language to write in  The fog came in thick flapping about my feet like blankets unraveling  I became afraid to have a daughter 
 
I called Pablo Neruda in the middle of the night as he walked underwater by Isla Negra  He moved like a dream porpoise  He seemed pregnant with words  They came out of his penis in long miraculous strings  The sea creatures quivered with joy  I said “Pablo I want to know how to bear the child in my belly onto this bed of uranium and I want to know if a woman can a be a poet ” He was large as a whale  He drank the sea and spouted it in glistening odes black and shiny  I said “I can’t have this child” and he laughed as if he had never done anything but carry and birth children 
 
So I packed my little bag as if I were going to the hospital and I left a note and the Wearever pots and sterilized nipples upon the glass missiles and took the cradle board than an American Indian friend had given me for the baby and that had made my husband snort– “You’re not going to carry the thing on your back are you” I took some money the car some books paper and pens my walking shoes an unwieldly IBM electric typewriter my pregnant belly and a dozen cloth diapers and I went out 
 
I knew how to carry a baby and how to carry a poem and I would learn how to have a baby and even how to have a poem  I would have enough milk for both  I would learn how to walk with them  But I didn’t know and I didn’t want to know how to have a husband and a matched set of Wearever pots
