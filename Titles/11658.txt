
Poetry chooses choice things carefully selecting
select words arranging
fabulously things arranged  To put it differently
is hard if not out of the question 
Poetrys like a clay plate  Its broken easily
under the weight of all those poems  In the hands
of the poet it sings  In those of others not only
doesnt it sing its out of the question
