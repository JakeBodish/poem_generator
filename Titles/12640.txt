Wee modest crimson-tippèd flowr Thous met me in an evil hour For I maun crush amang the stoure             Thy slender stem To spare thee now is past my powr             Thou bonie gem  Alas its no thy neibor sweet The bonie lark companion meet Bending thee mang the dewy weet             Wi spreckd breast When upward-springing blythe to greet             The purpling east  Cauld blew the bitter-biting north Upon thy early humble birth Yet cheerfully thou glinted forth             Amid the storm Scarce reard above the parent-earth             Thy tender form  The flaunting flowers our gardens yield High sheltring woods an was maun shield But thou beneath the random bield             O clod or stane Adorns the histie stibble-field             Unseen alane  There in thy scanty mantle clad Thy snawie-bosom sun-ward spread Thou lifts thy unassuming head             In humble guise But now the share uptears thy bed             And low thou lies Such is the fate of artless maid Sweet flowret of the rural shade By loves simplicity betrayd             And guileless trust Till she like thee all soild is laid             Low i the dust  Such is the fate of simple bard On lifes rough ocean luckless starrd Unskilful he to note the card             Of prudent lore Till billows rage and gales blow hard             And whelm him oer Such fate to suffering Worth is givn Who long with wants and woes has strivn By human pride or cunning drivn             To misrys brink Till wrenchd of evry stay but Heavn             He ruind sink Evn thou who mournst the Daisys fate That fate is thine no distant date Stern Ruins ploughshare drives elate             Full on thy bloom Till crushd beneath the furrows weight             Shall be thy doom
