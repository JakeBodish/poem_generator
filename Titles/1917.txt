
I call my wife outdoors to have her listento turn her ears upward beyond the cloud-veiled sky where the moon dances thin lightto tell her “Don’t hear the cars on the freeway it’s not the truck-rumble  It is and is notthe sirens ” She stands there on decka rocking boat wanting to please the captain who would have her hear the inaudible Her eyes so blue the day sky is enviousfix blackly on me her mouth poised on question like a stone  But she hears after all                                                            January on the Gulf  warm wind washing over us we stand chilled in the winter of those voices
