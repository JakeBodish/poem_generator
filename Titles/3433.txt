
I expected something up out of the water
not the shadow in the wave that rose
to fill the wave then splash a breath
off the abutting air      then disappear 
I didnt see any of this         only
the dark wave          Even the size of a whale
I dont see        what I look directly at 
I didnt see the pronghorn antelope
speed they pointed out equal our cars
but never having seen distance so large
I couldnt pin in it      point to antler
and saw in parallax instead       the world
entire a still brown arc of leap      so like
a first look at the milky way       each stone
a star I saw but could not see 
I didnt see
the Nazca earth drawings looking at a line
like a path      the vision on it   my not looking up 
 trying to see from on the ground looking
from a plane thousands of feet above
maybe I saw only what the unenlightened
marking out the lines could see from there
because I never saw the figures
until shown from books 
Ive told folk half the truth      that I was there I was
but embarrassed      never told      I missed my chance
until I saw       without embarrassment
this country miss its chance   looking at color
and not see what it looked directly at
without embarrassment
act      and not see that done
on its own hands      not see its own bright blood
