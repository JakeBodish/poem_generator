
Within this black hive to-night
There swarm a million bees
Bees passing in and out the moon
Bees escaping out the moon
Bees returning through the moon
Silver bees intently buzzing
Silver honey dripping from the swarm of bees
Earth is a waxen cell of the world comb
And I a drone
Lying on my back
Lipping honey
Getting drunk with that silver honey
Wish that I might fly out past the moon
And curl forever in some far-off farmyard flower
