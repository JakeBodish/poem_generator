
You better rap my brother
says he can
b-box his ass off 
Got DJ scratches and spins
 
will drop it on the two
and four the three and four 
Whatever you need 
 
Me posing my bars My flowsare second to none come hereson  See how it’s done 
 
Wanted to be a rapper Check 
Thought I was going to the NBA Check 
Father went to prison Check 
Brother too Check 
Mother died when I was eight Check 
Hung pictures of Luke Perry
on my bedroom wall
 What
 
Yep give me a bit and I’ll sprinkle
some subjectivity on it 
 
I loved that dude his whisper-voice his lean 
Auntie worried on the phoneGirl he got photos of some white boyall over his walls  Me rocking out
to Tom Petty’s “You Don’t Know How It Feels ”
 
Silent head nods do more
than throw shade 
 All black people are fluent
 in silence  Mangled Baldwin quote
Let’s keep wrenching  Everybody’s
 
fluent in silence 
 
You know what
a switchblade glare means  No need
to read the look she gave me
 
as I sang Let me run with you tonight
