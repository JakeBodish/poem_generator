
A stabbing in miniature it is
a tiny crime
my own blood parceled
drop by drop and set
on the flickering tongue
of this machine 
It is the spout-punching of trees
for syrup new and smooth
and sweeter
than nature ever intended 
It is Sleeping Beautys curse
and fascination 
It is the dipstick measuring of oil
from the Buicks throat
the necessary maintenance 
It is every vampire movie ever made 
Hand my martyr without lips
my quiet cow 
Ill milk your fingertips
for all theyre worth 
For what theyre worth 
Something like a harvest it is
a tiny crime
