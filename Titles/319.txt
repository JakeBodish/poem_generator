I am in my body  I am here in front of you  I am the temperature in this room  I am undressed in my nudity I am the light and shade you feel  I am more like other people than like you  I have before and after  I am my self entirely and only  My outside and inside are continuous  I am muscle organ fluid bone  I am monumental  You are the only one who sees me  ii  
I am not naked as I am I am naked as you see me  I am transparent almost visible  I have a time and a place  I am tribal and exotic  I must always carry objects  You are heroic  I am a complete museum the story of my own making  I am a mirror to you you are reflected in the looking at me  At best I mimic you  You write me  When you leave I will no longer exist  iii  
I am a single conscious point  I am indifferent  I am unself like a photogram  I am prehistoric before definition  Your body falls over me  I have depth and luminescence  I am neither here nor there I have infinite extension  I live inside the lived world the light and dark inside my head like dream substance  I am camera obscura the room itself  I both adore and resist
