
Love of air and water
Joined in apprehension
Perhaps you know whats there
By way of fear for while
 
Living in pursuit of
And going always forth
Toward something that trembles 
Its knowledge is your mind 
 
What do you think about
The great oceans sullen
Aristocrats these small
Headaches and dark affairs
 
That bathe themselves in your
Staging grounds where you go
To contemplate how what
You want became your mind
 
The black oblivion
Offers no reprieve for
You hunter in its keep
Your ears have grown too sharp
 
So sharp you almost hear
Your own heartbeat over
The subtle whispers of
Water’s dismal gardens 
 
Everything about you
Is overblown even
Your mouth is uniquely
Talented at its tasks
 
Gathering for slaughter
Animals in their sleep
Speaking without a sound 
Noah had seven laws
 
You have only one eat
To build life out of death
Survive above all things 
The fatalistic moon
 
Filtered down upon you
Seems an imitation
Of lives you will not live 
Would you be its hero
 
Would you call out against
The morning’s weaving light
That shames the night before
The passing of its cool
 
Would you be at the beach
When the invisible
Becomes a glow to surprise
Inland workers dreaming
 
Of unitarian
Proposals lose no sleep
To fear about your mouth 
It is their wayward friends
 
Who wandered too far west
Into fevered chaos
That wake up with your name
As screams exploding dreams 
 
The inland ether holds
Clouds in your dismal shape 
Lucky are those who know
Nothing who cannot see
 
Hell outlined in vapor 
Somewhere a piano
Plays a sorrowful song
Half-written by the hate
 
That a grieving loved one
Would stick into your heart 
Such are the arts of men 
Beware  Your time is near 
 
Someone has learned lessons
You didn’t mean to teach 
A crowd is gathering 
Your skull is their kingdom
