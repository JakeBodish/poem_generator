
Our sorrow had neither place nor carrier-away
and dared not hover over the child
whose breath opened as transom
of a frail house 
Nor could we put our sorrow in the dictionary
for ghastliness already shot out its own defining
in rags of fired light 
Pigeons would not sleek it
over their dirty coats nor fly
sorrow against the aviarys sharp fence 
Each day bridgeless each night birdless
all the nocturnals needless at the expanse
of our nightwatch 
                                     But wake at the moon
we could mumbling are wein a horror show inside of sleep
our shock-white minds caught on reels
where a childs body breaks the heart
and the mother cant know
if she counts as a mother  I dont know
if the child heard
what wept at the bedside
orderlies snapping smelling salts from chalky bullets
against all the mothers falling
all the fathers under
what each branch let down
theres a hidden weight to snow
