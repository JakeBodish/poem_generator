  i  a long voyage 1621  I left you where you areA humming late summer afternoon mottled by shade a man reading a letterBecomes the image of a man readingThat I am forgetting This page is small yet stout enough To bear me whole upon it to youAll the way in London  I may expand Myself at leisure then fold it tightA sanctuaryLike our vessel christened The GeorgeMy letter is another ark to preserve me George No midnight is so private as the sea’sTimbers breathe a loose rope snaps  as the windShoves you behind then slaps your faceSeeing nothing nothing to be seen you feelUnhoused evicted from time But tonight my love my lamp is feathered shy Herald of the next ransack  assail  Behold the storm petrel gray wick-threaded throat Burning the oil secreted an amber muskOf uncompassed seas  the solitary hunt Of error  sign That delirium which turnedOur ship’s boy to mowing fields of Atlantic salt Like windrows he dropped the waves  Until gaffed pulled like a sleeve Through himself He will live tongue-bit torn To return likely to a stool set on the shaleWhere he can mend nets skirted by braggartsWho have never traveled fartherThan the smoke dribbling from their chimneys I try never to imagine drowning Noisy urgent inefficiencies above waves Pummeling sky shredding  the bodyAnchored only in its just longing for air The tighter death’s embrace the more languorousThe moment  So this boy sufferedSome vast charity of sight  He was what he saw an adam  Now he may be adamant  stain  distance  also that small satin interruptionOf terror the instant breath’s Orphaned by self’s perishing through poetry  Like Daphne his voice is forfeit for the songBut we do not grieve for Daphne My bird-light gutters  Its call had soundedLike dry wood giving up a nail What is this your wound that you must follow itFor you I had no answer consider only the reveriesOf the carpet navigator in his room  ListeningTo collisions of wave  star outside his towerRock-rapt icebound with a mind by dread  ceremony  the dozen arts of courtesy Girded he invented those ideal earths in latitudesUnstrung that I now trespass After I had translated two books To the pouring of seas  clamor of sailorsI began to brood long on landlessness Coming to believe it my sovereign my home When on the flat horizon of weeks at noon the flawA color merely private ethereal collectingHeft in the warp of time  Days Before we quailed at the barbed illegible peltOf forest I wrecked forlorn upon its savorSweet damage of apples Fermenting in rain-soaked hayGiving way to something ranker I tasted it at dinner lying on my tongue I am His Majesty’s servant as my god made meI am also my damps  exaltations I am afraid Heaven  hell enlisted their geographers A map has opened the soul’s five hinges  PersianWith expectance how often have I feasted On departure  London Naples Marriage Damascus now your dear person So much flowing through meMy sight has silted dark my mouth  I begAll the many tongues your wonder cabinet holds Dolphin mockingbird Muscovy bear to tellThis arrival so unforeseen disorderly As my hope you will not forget who I was  amUnwildered unwestered constant returning Bless you where you are  where you would beWhen you are there  bring you thither                                           My loveWhat may never not be strange WhatThis morning will wake  make me new  ii  winter 1621  It begins like a legend told to a fretful childIt was it was and it was not  It beginsAs if with symptoms of that sweatI hear so late oh notThank God too late you were sparedA little blush along the throat  A restlessness Then the silkworm’s casement tapering  pale as the egg of a chimney-swiftWhich we will convert to cloth To cover the naked Indian  A bobbinWhich dropped in my tisane would ravel the maelstromOf silk  Spindle of whirlwind spoonfulOf follow  The thread’s stained scalding mile Pours out my glass tempered in our kilnAs each new settler is also seasonedIn this furnace our new-found land As the man drowning believes he digestsThe mild water as the damned marry flame yet blister so do I know myselfGrasped by change at the stroke of change Hold this glass up to your eye  throughIts pebbled horizon you may spy your roomSee its ire of surfaces sore with chairs  Green grass green grace   Would that I could account this world oneWhere nothing is lost only exchanged Without coppice park romancely glade Or commanding vantage Woods press on us they fester  they watch  To the northeast white sprucePhalanxes of fledging pinions clamp Root to granite  hoardWhat they glean off salt-fog sea-spray  stone  From ewers of willow-oaks darkness steams At breakfast I have pinched the plantlets Insinuated by a maple’s winged seed overnightIt unclasps twin leaves pale hands Loosening the soil of my restThey never empty of their solicitations I find no empires here no apostles or emeralds Instead all things a-broil with an awful begetting my hours unsettled by some new showOf riotous  mystical imagination Though we might wish to wedge us barnacle-tightTo shore’s edge our foundation raisedOn marshland recalls this irritable fact The estuary a nursery of strange devices Throws off new forms so promiscuouslyI wonder how the world holds any more shapeThan a dreamFrom my hand at night my lightA little oil in a dish or a rush taper smokingNot so different from his flower Ovid’s fantastic shapes shadows Of an old empire’s former splendorNow perjured by Virginia’s clay  leaf  sand Turned to the king’s profit as iron silk  glass Belief is possible at night solitary firelit Then I can believe in Ovid’s centaursOr at death that he was met by a three-headed dog I can believe in your letters which never come It is for you that I persistIn translating fresh birdsong like this bunting’sComecomecome wherewherewhere All together      down the hill  Where did they go who went before usStarved trove scatter of blue beads  a nameGrafted to that bald acre  Roanoke There is my terror  my tale to go west Under this eternity of nameless trees And what will you make of this Humble hieroglyphic of nature I forward to youNocturnal double-wombed variously calledMonkey Fox FrostedOr Short-headed or Indolent Let this Leafy-Eared Rat-Tailed ShufflerThe naturals call Possoun Join your zoo’s other fantasies  with the Little Military Learnéd Horse Enjoy its dish of ale  Its fur is durableIts flesh wholesome white  pleasant With one hand I can reach forA medicine man’s last breath caught in a vialOr a hummingbird stuffed With arsenic  leaves  looking Like a fine jeweled dagger aimed at my heart With the other hand I brush away The web spun in a fox skull’s whitened socket While a wild turkey glowers from its cornerLike a small dyspeptic dragon My cullings do not quite master my closet When I imagine myself returned to the smells noise of London from my stiff kneeSands grinding as I walk no marvelsExcept those which the mirror surprises in all of usThe swan-white wing at my temple I do not know what to hope forThat you do not see me or that you doBut as though I were pinned under glass At my windowsill a quince widensA jaundiced eye into the dark where areReal nettles beneath the words  invincible redRoot of the madder  As long as any image of this worldSticks in my soul I remain  iii  spring1622
