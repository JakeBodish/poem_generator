these vitamin double ds
gonna put cows outta business 
these Sunday bests
if frozen would delight 
unpasteurized  untamed
they swing
in the hammock
of my torso 
they magnetize
my mans hands 
like a Wonder Woman blast
or a web of thunder from
Storms wrist
this cocktail
is nurturing napalm
manna dew Pepto Bismol
for civilization 
you cant outwit these
aureolas 
these nipples are
necrophilias enemy 
Coltrane couldnt blow
these tumescent tubas 
these are gourds
thatll make a shekere
obsolete
make an eggplant
go pale 
these breasts
gonna put old Betsy
outta business
 send the men
with goats a-packin 
this love is like a faucet
it turns on  on
