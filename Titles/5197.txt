changed  Or maybethe doctors had misunderstood   It was June  The enormous elm treewas green again and the scentof   hyacinth reached through the windowand followed wherever he went   And the sky was the firmamentHis life was never better Each small white spotless cloud that passedwas like a long-wished-for letter   But then he remembered his promise It came like a mild crampand it sat there all day in the back of   his mindlike a gas bill awaiting a stamp   He saw three faces that Sundaymother sister nieceall with the same kind brown scared eyesthat brought him no peace   The sidewalk sparrows were peeping His whole house smelled like a flower But he remembered his promise The drugstore said one hour   Back home again he was tired The label said caution said warning He left the clear orange bottleon the lip of   the sink till morning   The insert said warning said caution The insert said constipation It said insomnia vivid dreamsand hypersalivation     and increased urination     and a spinning sensation   It also said night sweats andagranulocytosisand strongly suggested a full glass of   waterbe drunk with all doses   The insert said all thisthe insert he never read But he didn’t have to read itto know what it said   The bedroom was calm with moonlightand the breeze through the screen was cooling Through the elm leaves the shivery light on the wallcame like quicksilver pooling But   just before five something woke him  a close whisper   or maybe a far cry  and the bedroom was queasy with light the colorof   lapis lazuli He lay there listening hardtill six till seven till eight       At nine he remembered the bottle But nine nine was too late  “Don’t take me” cried the Clozapine “Don’t take me” cried the pill  By ten he was feeling restlesswith a whole day left to kill “Don’t take me” cried the Clozapine “Yes don’t” cried the medication  And the bright yellow morning seemed suddenly edgedwith a shady fascination  Why should he go to his workplaceWho was his supervisorHe had a sickening feelingthat he was becoming wiser His room filled up with interest He had begun to thinkHe thought of the knives in the kitchenand the bottles under the sink He thought as he switched the stove onor stood at his shaving mirroror reached for his belt in the wardrobe  Thinking made things clearer  Even the bedroom windowthe open window full of suncontinually hintedat something that should be done But he was crooked and useless  He was a piece of shit  And so as everyone knew he would he failed to go through with it    “Don’t take me” cried the Clozapine  “Don’t take me” cried the drug  Just then the telephone rang  Just then he ripped out the plug    “Don’t take me” cried the Clozapine  “Don’t take me” cried the poison  And the door of   the house creaked open and the cellar door lilted and murmured and the garden gate groaned and yawned and let a little noise in    There just outside his window lurked life like a cheap cartoon  He shut the sash locked it and checked it and checked it all afternoon    He lowered the blinds on that world no longer an agent of   it but then with one finger pulled down a slat and set his eye above it   At first it was grimly amusingat last it was grimly grimto watch all those hunched hurried peoplewho made like they weren’t watching him   The neighbors were thinking out loud They knew he was no fucking good So he slumped on a stool in the cornerlike a bad little snaggletooth should   They called him a dirty pig and laughedand said he shouldn’t exist Sometimes they made a tsking soundor oinked at him or hissed   They hissed that he was to blamefor everything and everyone knew itand that if   he weren’t such a pussyhe’d know what to do and he’d do it   He lay on his side on the rug unable to move at allexcept for his big right toe   which dug and dug at the wall      which dug at the wall             which dug   “Don’t take me” cried the Clozapine “Don’t take me” cried the cure And they begged him to sew his mouth shutjust to make goddamn sure   “Don’t take me” cried the Clozapine “Don’t take me” cried the poison And the gate to the wicked city gapedand the gates of the temple screamed and screamedand the gates of the garden groaned and yawnedand the gates of the ziggurat gabbled in griefand sucked all life’s sorrows and joys in    His thoughts were advancing like wolves He lay still for an hour and a halfthen reared up onto his rickety legslike a newborn calf Then     rug                          hall                                       stairsporch              stoop                          streetand the blacktop humanly warmon the soles of   his naked feet His walk was stiffened by fear but it took him where he was goinginto the terrible world of children and daffodils growing       and friendly people helloing        and the Super out doing the mowing        and the two old sisters out in wool sweaters with their wrinkled            cheeks pinkly glowing       and the pretty lady who would give birth by Christmas barely          showing but showing       and the policeman helping to keep the lazy afternoon traffic            flowing       and time itself slowing       and none of them none of them knowingthat an odious axis was formingthat it would not be controlledthat schemes were afoot that a footwas a thing for a jackboot to holdthat the street was a movie setthat it was not warm and sunnythat a creditor was callingwho could not be paid with money that the world was like a sliverof   iron held in the handand his mind the lodestone above itthat made it stir or standthat the air was slowly changingto a color they didn’t knowthat he was a famous doctoron a television show But what could he do Even friendswould take these facts for liesand he couldn’t tell who the enemies werethough he felt the hot breath of their eyesso he kept his big mouth shut and tried to play alongand plowed down the street toward the coffeeshopas if nothing at all were wrong He tried not to notice the numbers painted on garbage cans He tried and he tried not to lookat the black unmarked sedans The coffeeshop smelled like coffeebut it felt different inside A new waitress went by  She winked  He kept his eyes open wide Everything screamed “Run away”But he wasn’t really thereSo he stood by the gumball machinesand smiled and tried not to stare “The power is yours” said a T-shirt “Look for lightning” reported the weather And the stranger who offered the Sports section said“It’s all there Chief  Just put it together ”Then wild-eyed out of the kitchenstormed a small hard old manshouting in a strange languageand waving a frying panshoving him out the doorand into the chattering streetshoving him waving shouting and pointing at his feet    at his bare gray feet Then came the dark blue uniformthe badge glinting in the sunand the belt jangling like a storm trooper’sas the boots broke into a run “Take that” cried the patrolman “Take that” cried Johnny Law Street knee neck  cuffs curb jaw And the flatfoot pushed him bleeding into the sleek cruiserand he heard all the gawkers thinkingthat he was a pig and a loserand his chin throbbedand the handcuffs ate at his wristand he would be hacked into pieces soonand would not be missed  “Don’t take me” cried the victim “Don’t take me” cried the threat But the angry back of a headwas the only response he could get Lying on his side like a child at the end of a big dayhe gazed up through the windowand watched it all slip away The little pen where they put himhad a toilet but no stall Here and there a messagescarred the gloss-white wall Time passed  But you couldn’t tell iton the trapped fly ticking the ceilingor the flickering light overheador the sore on his chin congealing      or on the sound of the other pigs in the other pens squealing When the men came he was ready He talked  They took it all down And soon they were back in the cruiseron their way across town Then into the mirrored buildingover the waxed lobby floorsdown miles of echoing hallwaysthrough the heavy brown doorsinto a humming beige roomwith a bed and a river viewand an outside lock and jailerswho wore white instead of blue “Take that” smiled the doctor  “Take that” smiled the nurse  He pressed his lips still tighterand things got worse and worse “Please” threatened the nurse “Please” growled the doctor He raised his fists to cover his mouthbut the nurse was too close and he clocked her Now into the room came the big menwho did not clamor or shoutbut pinned him with ease to the bedstrapped him down and went out And the doctor was there again trailinga spider web of cologneand the doctor told what would happen nextin an expert monotoneand the nurse took a needleand emptied it into his armand they both left content that he could do no more harmand he fought and the straps cut his shoulders and he gnawed at his lip and it bledand he held his bladder for three long hoursthen shivered and pissed the bed When the doctor came a fifth timeit was long past dawn They’d found him a room said the doctorgently restraining a yawn The next two days were sleep and words through a fine white mist Then he woke inside a machinewhose motion he couldn’t resist       “Tick-tock” said the clock         “Creak creak” said the bed        “Drip drip” said the sink         “Throb throb” went his head        “Ho-hum” sighed the night nurse          “Heh-heh” said the sicko        “Why Why” screamed the patient        “Howl howl” cried the psycho         “Wolf Wolf” cried the boy         “Gobble gobble” sang the freaks         “Sa sa” cried the king        “Tick-tock” went the weeks        “Bang bang” said the tv        “Teeter-totter” went his brain        “Click click” went the checkers        “Pitter-patter” went the rain         “Bring-bring” said the pay phone          “Snip snip” went Fate         “Jangle-jingle” went the keys         “Clank-clink” went the gate         “Bye-bye” said the nurse         “Bye-bye” said the guard         “Bar-bar” said the doctor         “Baa-baa” said the lamb          “My my” said his mother          “Boohoo” cried Bo Peep          “Bow-wow” said the wolf         “Baa-baa” said the sheep In the car away from that place the family had a pleasant chat He seemed fine again and humble though his speech was oddly flat He said that the halfway housewhere he would be residingwas located on a quiet block and hadgreen vinyl siding There he met new peopleand watched the televisionwhich did not watch him backor speak to him with derisionand he performed certain tasksmeant to teach certain skillsand he got small checks from the governmentto pay his enormous bills Each night he fell asleep and each morning he got upand he washed down his medicineand squashed the paper cup feeling in all much better more in touch with common sense and also slightly boredby the lack of consequence And the church bells rangand a dinner bell tinkledand the school bell tolledand called all the good girls and boys in And all of them brought all their toys in And all of them swallowed their poison
