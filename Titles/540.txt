         All night I hear the voice of someone seeking me out  All night you abandon me slowly like the water that sobs slowly falling  All night I write luminous messages messages of rain all night someone checks for me and I check for someone 
         The noise of steps in the circle near this choleric light birthed from my insomnia  Steps of someone who no longer writhes who no longer writes  All night someone holds back then crosses the circle of bitter light 
         All night I drown in your eyes become my eyes  All night I prod myself on toward that squatter in the circle of my silence  All night I see something lurch toward my looking something humid contrived of silence launching the sound of someone sobbing 
         Absence blows grayly and night goes dense  Night the shade of the eyelids of the dead viscous night exhaling some black oil that blows me forward and prompts me to search out an empty space without warmth without cold  All night I flee from someone  I lead the chase I lead the fugue  I sing a song of mourning  Black birds over black shrouds  My brain cries  Demented wind  I leave the tense and strained hand I don’t want to know anything but this perpetual wailing this clatter in the night this delay this infamy this pursuit this inexistence 
         All night I see that abandonment is me that the sole sobbing voice is me  We can search with lanterns cross the shadow’s lie  We can feel the heart thud in the thigh and water subside in the archaic site of the heart 
         All night I ask you why  All night you tell me no
