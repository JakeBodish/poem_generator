After the wind just stops you still hear
the wind’s wild almost its approach and retreat and how it kept
circling as-if-trying as if about-to-be an almost-speech
loud and full of syntax casting about for
life form limit fate  To be bodied  To strut  To have
meaning  How easily we wear ourselves
as if it is nothing to have
origin whirl outcome end      and still be 
After the high winds stop you’re forced to hear
the freshness of what’s
there  It smacks shimmers this sound of
the scarcely there the adamantly almost all betweens sub-­
siding till adjustment and then the re-blanketing evenness sets in     Gone
all that acceleration shooting up and back futurist wild with naming and naming
its one price  Oh nothing holds  Just the rattling of the going and
coming together of things as if matter itself is trying
to find something true to
say crazed investigation tentative prophecy trying on savage
shape figure progression widening without be-
coming  Is this the last war now finally but no only more of notion’s
motions more more the wind says break grief loosen possibility let vague
hopes float sink let other debris slip into
their place  Rootless mind  Shallow whirling of  law and more and yet more law
brocading the emptiness  Then suddenly
all stills  It is near noon  No more
spillage  No more gorgeous waste of effort  No more upgathering
out-tossed reachings of green as if imagining some out there exists hovering
inhalations then as-if-hiding then all coughed-out at once in a tumble  too much
too many disconcerted uncountable  Yet no dream    
After the wind stops you hear fact  You hear fact’s plan  It is huge 
The tree does not escape  Things are finished forces 
You hear a name-call from far off tossed dropped  Someone gives up 
Light rips here from there  Where birdcalls cease you hear the under-
neath  Try living again day’s long pitched syllable-ooze
hums after the high winds stop  your final footprint lifts off  no matterhow cleanyou want it to be
nothing is ever going to be gone enough  Oh  Oak show us up 
Indecipherable green sound us  Stilled leaf-chatter quiver up
again rustle the secret rule we’ll never catch in
time  To be late is to be alive  This Sunday  All things are
mention of themselves as the dog barks the air conditioner
scours its air and each thing takes its place  But look keenly adamantly
a road has appeared a sense that something is happening striates
the open air there is a limping in the light a tiny withdrawal of light from
light which makes a form in the gully you haven’t changed much it
says children still appearing out of nowhere now so violently heavy with
life they dart they breed you be a ghost now the surrounding tunes up
as if it is all going to begin again though this time without you
standing here noticing     So notice is given  The look on the light
is that of an argument about to be made and won 
Yes you were underneath history for this while
you were able to write the history of being underneath
you were able to disappear and make the rest appear 
But now it wants its furious place again all floral and full of appearance
full of its fourth wall its silvery after-tomorrow
and ramping-up now quite a spectacular dusk 
This page is turning  It is full of mattering  Our unrealized project glows in
your mind  The animals lift their heads for an instant then back 
New shoots in the parched field  All the details are important you think but
no even the ruins look like they might be fake important but fake 
though we must learn what they have to teach then push them back
deep into the light  This is the way it is it murmurs circling
out here in the middle of summer  Which summer was it which was
the last of the summers  All the children are returned home  Day turns its windless
folio  You stay it says  We pass here now onto the next-on world  You stay
