
I  Invocation
Its crazy to think one could describe them 
Calling on reason fantasy memory eyes and ears 
As though they were all alike any more
Than sweeps opticians poets or masseurs    
Moreover they are for more than one reason   
Difficult to speak of seriously and freely
And I have never even this is difficult to say   
Plainly without foolishness or irony
Consulted one for professional help though it happens
Many or most of my friends have and that   
Perhaps is why it seems urgent to try to speak   
Sensibly about them about the psychiatrists II  Some Terms
“Shrink” is a misnomer  The religious   
Analogy is all wrong too and the old   
Half-forgotten jokes about Viennese accents
And beards hardly apply to the good-looking woman   
In boots and a knit dress or the man   
Seen buying the Sunday Times in mutton-chop
Whiskers and expensive running shoes 
In a way I suspect that even the terms “doctor”   
And “therapist” are misnomers the patient
Is not necessarily “sick ” And one assumes   
That no small part of the psychiatrist’s   
Role is just that to point out misnomers III  Proposition
These are the first citizens of contingency    
Far from the doctrinaire past of the old ones   
They think in their prudent meditations
Not about ecstasy the soul leaving the body   
Nor enthusiasm the god entering one’s person   
Nor even about sanity which means
Health an impossible perfection
But ponder instead relative truth and the warm   
Dusk of amelioration  The cautious
Young augurs with their family-life good books   
And records and foreign cars believe   
In amelioration in that and in suffering IV  A Lakeside Identification
Yes crazy to suppose one could describe them 
And yet there was this incident at the local beach   
Clouds of professors and the husbands of professors
Swam dabbled or stood to talk with arms folded
Gazing at the lake     and one of the few townsfolk there   
With no faculty status a matter-of-fact competent
Catholic woman of twenty-seven with five children   
And a first-rate body pointed her finger   
At the back of one certain man and asked me
“Is that guy a psychiatrist” and by god he was “Yes”   
She said “He looks like a psychiatrist ”   
Grown quiet I looked at his pink back and thought V  Physical Comparison With Professors And Others
Pink and a bit soft-bodied with a somewhat jazzy   
Middle-class bathing suit and sandy sideburns to me   
He looked from the back like one more professor 
And from the front too the boyish unformed carriage   
Which foreigners always note in American men combined   
As in a professor with that liberal quizzical
Articulate gaze so unlike the more focused more   
Tolerant expression worn by a man of action surgeon
Salesman athlete  On closer inspection was there
Perhaps a self-satisfied benign air a too studied   
Gentleness toward the child whose hand he held loosely   
Absurd to speculate but then the woman saw something VI  Their Seriousness With Further Comparisons
In a certain sense they are not serious 
That is they are serious useful deeply helpful   
Concerned only in the way that the pilots of huge
Planes radiologists and master mechanics can   
At their best be serious  But however profound
The psychiatrists may be they are not serious the way
A painter may be serious beyond pictures or a businessman   
May be serious beyond property and cash or even   
The way scholars and surgeons are serious each rapt
In his work’s final cause contingent upon nothing   
Beyond work persons recoveries  And this is fitting   
Who would want to fly with a pilot who was serious
About getting to the destination safely Terrifying idea 
That a pilot could over-extend perhaps try to fly   
Too well or suffer from Pilot’s Block of course
It may be that just as they must not drink liquor   
Before a flight they undergo regular required check-ups   
With a psychiatrist to prevent such things from happening VII  Historical The Bacchae
Madness itself as an idea leaves us confused 
Incredulous that it exists or cruelly facetious   
Or stricken with a superstitious awe as if bound
By the lost cults of Trebizond and Pergamum       
The most profound study of madness is found   
In the Bacchae of Euripides so deeply disturbing
That in Cambridge Massachusetts the players   
Evaded some of the strongest unsettling material
By portraying poor sincere fuddled decent Pentheus
As a sort of fascistic bureaucrat but it is Dionysus   
Who holds rallies instills exaltations of violence   
With his leopards and atavistic troops above law
Reason and the good sense and reflective dignity
Of Pentheus Pentheus humiliated addled made to suffer   
Atrocity as a minor jest of the smirking God 
When Bacchus’s Chorus who call him “most gentle” observe   
“Ten thousand men have ten thousand hopes some fail   
Some come to fruit but the happiest man is he
Who gathers the good of life day by day” as though
Life itself were enough does that mean to leave ambition   
And is it a kind of therapy or truth Or bothVIII  A Question
On the subject of madness the Bacchae seems   
On the whole more pro than contra  The Chorus
Says of wine “There is no other medicine for misery”
When the Queen in her ecstasy or her enthusiasm 
Tears her terrified son’s arm from his body or bears   
His head on her spear she remains happy so long
As she remains crazy the God himself who bound fawnskin   
To the women’s flesh armed them with ivy arrows   
And his orgies’ livery debases poor Pentheus first
Then leads him to mince capering towards female Death   
And dismemberment flushed grinning the grave young   
King of Thebes pulls at a slipping bra-strap simpers
Down at his turned ankle  Pentheus “Should I lift up   
Mount Cithæron Bacchae mother and all”   Dionysus “Do what you want to do  Your mind
Was unstable once but now you sound more sane   
You are on your way to great things ”   
The question is Which is the psychiatrist Pentheus or DionysusIX  Pentheus As Psychiatrist
With his reasonable questions Pentheus tries   
To throw light on the old customs of savagery    
Like a brave doctor he asks about it all
He hears everything “Weird fantastic things”   
The Messenger calls them with their breasts   
Swollen their new babies abandoned mothers
Among the Bacchantes nestled gazelles
And young wolves in their arms and suckled them   
You might see a single one of them tear a fat calf
In two still bellowing with fright while others   
Clawed heifers to pieces ribs and hooves   
Were strewn everywhere blood-smeared scraps
Hung from the fir trees furious bulls
Charged and then fell stumbling pulled down
To be stripped of skin and flesh by screaming women    
And Pentheus listened  Flames burned in their hair   
Unnoticed thick honey spurted from their wands   
And the snakes they wore like ribbons licked
Hot blood from their flushed necks Pentheus
Was the man the people told     “weird things” like   
A middle-class fantasy of release and when even
The old men bent Cadmus and Tiresias dress up
In fawnskin and ivy beating their wands on the ground   
Trying to carouse it is Pentheus down-to-earth
Sober who raises his voice in the name of dignity 
Being a psychiatrist how could he attend to the Chorus’s warning   
Against “those who aspire” and “a tongue without reins”X  Dionysus As Psychiatrist
In a more hostile view the psychiatrists
Are like Bacchus the knowing smirk of his mask   
His patients his confident guidance of passion
And even his little jokes as when the great palace   
Is hit by lightning which blazes and stays   
Bouncing among the crumpled stone walls    
And through the burning rubble he comes   
With his soft ways picking along lightly   
With a calm smile for the trembling Chorus
Who have fallen to the ground bowing
In the un-Greek Eastern way What Asian women   
He asks Were you disturbed just now when Bacchus
Jostled the palace He warns Pentheus to adjust   
To learn the ordinary man’s humble sense of limits   
Violent limits to the rational world  He cures
Pentheus of the grand delusion that the dark   
Urgencies can be governed simply by the mind
And the mind’s will  He teaches Queen Agave to look
Up from her loom up at the light at her tall   
Son’s head impaled on the stiff spear clutched   
In her own hand soiled with dirt and blood XI  Their Philistinism Considered
“Greek Tragedy” of course is the sort of thing
They like and like the idea of     though not “tragedy”
In the sense of newspapers  When a patient shot one of them
People phoned in many upset as though a deep
Special rule had been abrogated someone had gone too far    
The poor doctor as described by the evening Globe
Turned out to be a decent conventional man Doctors   
For Peace B’Nai Brith numerous articles almost
Carefully so like Paul Valéry or like Rex Morgan M D  who
In the same Globe attends a concert with a longjawed woman    
First Panel “We’re a little early for the concert   
There’s an art museum we can stroll through” “I’d like
