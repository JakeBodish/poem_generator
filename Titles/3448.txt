
      In dogma
is the secret that renders God unconditioned
 
on one condition 
“If you are not My people
I am not your God ”
As fashioned by His peoples witness
 
a made thing
God
condemns the made things graven
 
images are  Inscribed as born
 
wittingly of Himself
God is
so to speak
that Father
abler than the most sovereign
 
earthly father to make
all things good 
God the Father is conceived as
 
for us 
Purposive
stewarding
benign
 
He covenants our living on 
“Written in
 
continuance” in His Book
before they took form
were the parts of our fitful bodies 
As if whats
given with the world is
 
life only
 
life
and not
along with it
in time at last lifes needful withdrawal
 
Gods said to let the truthful
keep their lives forever if they swear God
does what He says 
These are the portions either
Ill outlast death
 
or it me 
Little matter which
 
if its the avowed
 
God Im given up to 
That Im settled in the finite is whats true instead 
Living is a good I dont want stopped
 
even for the saved 
Im beholden to it all the way that
in its one chance each with me and others
death hasnt used itself
up yet  Mine affords me another day
 
hours before its light  Along with the caused
things outside that I cant see Im here
ahead of myself again
toward that coupling with the ground
 
when “I am poured out like water ”
Deaths still to be heard from at its least reserved 
Under its breath it primes me to pay up and look pleasant
