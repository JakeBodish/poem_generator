
On the Pan American Highway somewhere
between the north and south continent
you come across a chain of volcanoes
 
a coast with a thick growth of palm trees
crunching waves of the sea an isthmus
Neruda called “slender earth like a whip ”
 
When the road bends turns into a street
the walls splattered with “Yanqui Go Home”
you see a boy fifteen years old
 
barefoot sniffing glue in a small plastic bag 
An old woman in an apron will step out
say “This is the right street ”
 
In the public square there will be no friend
from school to welcome you no drive
to Sonsonate city of coconuts
 
no one to order cold Pilseners oyster
cocktails or convince the waitress
into dancing a cumbia or two with you 
 
Instead at the local bar you’ll raise
a bottle next to strangers stub
your cigarette out on the floor 
 
You’ll watch a country ten years
after the civil war an old man sitting
on the curb head between knees
 
open hand stretched out 
Everything will hurt your hair
your toenails even your shoes 
 
You’ll curse dusty streets demented
sun slowly burning the nape of your neck
stray dogs following you to the park 
 
By nightfall you drag yourself back to the bars
looking for a lost country in a shot of Tíc Táck 
Against the wall three men with their guitars 
 
When you lie on a hotel bed
too tired to sleep when you feel torn
twisted like an old newspaper blown
 
from city to city you have reached the place 
You have begun to speak like a man
by the side of the road barefoot
