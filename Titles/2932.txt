It felt odd from the start this war 
At the start the death of Saddam
when Baghdad was bombed but
               hes not dead a bizarre
                          Zapata
and then the Scuds fired at  Kuwait
               but they werent Scuds
the chemical weapons of mass destruction
factory  with earth banks and barbed wire
                  which wasnt one however
and the column of tanks destroyed leaving Basra
                    which was three tanks
the endless securing of towns and cities
                      which arent secure
even allowing for the distinction
that secure does not mean safe
the Uprising in Basra
which no one could find there   
                                  Once
 there were poems in inverted commas this
is a war of inverted commas  Once 
I wrote that poems about poems 
dont seem as abstract as they once did
although you dont need quotes quoting 
yourself and the Oxford Companion decided 
this meant I was no longer being abstract  when
in fact I meant that poems about poems
in that case partly a child 
are not abstract because the abstract 
in them works through to a deeper real  Will
this war work through to the deeper real 
at last Now it seems again however
that it feels odd this war  I have paid it 
careful attention for almost a fortnight and what 
I would note here is that singular oddness
of feeling it evokes one is alwaysat a tangent to it somehow albeitwith despairs edgy wit  The deathshave black solidity as if from method nowhite napalm suddenness   I thought is itfarce encoring tragedy but thereis too much earnest passion in the eviland one watches that eros like watchingspiders breed It is what they do on this planetas a childs science fiction exercisemight observe  Spiders feed in street windowsbroken by childrens bones flying butthe US polls say yes who want this so much Who know what they do and also thatthey want those inverted commas George-Bush-as-by-George-Orwell             Is the USneed for war not a way to teach Americansgeography as Bierce is often quoted buta greed for abstractions for the abstract rathernot met by food or sex or fashion byany intimate geography but this But thenthe abstract is not the inverted commaseither and it is those they want the quoteswhich in two days will expire                                the world left gasping with winded logic the new skulls on dresses in the marketplace damp empty dusty shoes  Günter Grass called this a wanted war and perhaps that desire accounts for the oddncss of feeling the animal impossibility of communication  In a damp concrete corner in the market ones self-sense crouches close alert for friendly fire
