I said top hat
I said microphone
four little golden baby heads
wait I said pirate ghost
wait wait I said closed eye smiling cat
he scrawled back oh my god
I thought fuck yeah I can read this at the marathon
he said Eileen smilesehhh I can use it
the bell of my computer rang
same message
wait the cat is crying with relief
the cat is a devil now
the cat is not mad
the cat making racialized jazz
uh or not my white hands
I’m talking to everyone now 
and I’m using a filter  No I’m not
I acknowledge that there is an
image of me twice  I only recently
learned the term jazz hands
if we fucked Pennsylvania up what is our
hope to live in a stolen country that was always stolen
and worked largely by stolen people  Out of a conservative
diaspora came I mongrel poet from Massachusetts
to make my marklove  these things and opportunities
to speak  We can’t fall down we teem in the new opportunity
we discover what resistance means
our time  blowing up the inside of my computer
buck studies
the phone says delivered
what is 
Adam says did you see my beard 
We talk about money awhile
I ride my bike  Get off the phone goes
ding  It’s his beard calling  I go oh

he says lol
then skull
then rocket
then turkey
green pistol
and a flame  I
don’t know what to say back to that
I say bike and go
