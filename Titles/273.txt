
I dont love my son
the way I thought
my mother should love me
so I handed him a shoe box
to put the dead bird in
and shut the door  
It was a mistake 
not to be sure he buried it 
not to grab the children
gathered at my back door
by their shoulders
to push them into a half-circle
and a prayer  
Should have made them
take turns digging the hole
each one of their pudgy hands
finger stiff reds box
to lower it to the ground  
It wasnt my place
to teach other womens children
about death so my own son
snuck the shoe box
into his backpack
dead-eyed bird rolling
like a plastic prize ball
told the principal
this cold puff
of field bird
had been his pet  
See him
clutching a coffin
the size of his feet
eyes wide over a pout
giving a man a reason
good enough to hold him
