
When you see millions of the mouthless deadAcross your dreams in pale battalions goSay not soft things as other men have saidThat youll remember  For you need not so Give them not praise  For deaf how should they knowIt is not curses heaped on each gashed headNor tears  Their blind eyes see not your tears flow Nor honour  It is easy to be dead Say only this “They are dead ” Then add thereto“Yet many a better one has died before ”Then scanning all the oercrowded mass should youPerceive one face that you loved heretoforeIt is a spook  None wears the face you knew Great death has made all his for evermore
