
Sir I am not a bird of prey
a Lady does not seize the day 
I trust that brief Time will unfold
our youth before he makes us old 
How could we two write lines of rhyme
were we not fond of numbered Time
and grateful to the vast and sweet
trials his days will make us meet
The Graves not just the bodys curse
no skeleton can pen a verse
So while this numbered World we see
lets sweeten Time with poetry
and Time in turn may sweeten Love
and give us time our love to prove 
Youve praised my eyes forehead breast
youve all our lives to praise the rest
