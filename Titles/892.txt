thee Bright effluence of bright essence increate  Or hearst thou rather pure Ethereal stream Whose Fountain who shall tell before the Sun Before the Heavens thou wert and at the voice Of God as with a Mantle didst invest The rising world of waters dark and deep Won from the void and formless infinite  Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing Escapt the Stygian Pool though long detaind In that obscure sojourn while in my flight Through utter and through middle darkness borne With other notes then to th Orphean Lyre I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night Taught by the heavnly Muse to venture down The dark descent and up to reascend Though hard and rare thee I revisit safe And feel thy sovran vital Lamp but thou Revisitst not these eyes that rowle in vain To find thy piercing ray and find no dawn So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs Or dim suffusion veild    Yet not the more Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt Cleer Spring or shadie Grove or Sunnie Hill Smit with the love of sacred Song but chief Thee Sion and the flowrie Brooks beneath That wash thy hallowd feet and warbling flow Nightly I visit nor somtimes forget Those other two equald with me in Fate So were I equald with them in renown Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides And Tiresias and Phineus Prophets old  Then feed on thoughts that voluntarie move Harmonious numbers as the wakeful Bird Sings darkling and in shadiest Covert hid Tunes her nocturnal Note    Thus with the Year Seasons return but not to me returns Day or the sweet approach of Evn or Morn Or sight of vernal bloom or Summers Rose Or flocks or heards or human face divine But cloud in stead and ever-during dark Surrounds me from the chearful wayes of men Cut off and for the Book of knowledg fair Presented with a Universal blanc Of Natures works to mee expungd and rasd And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out  So much the rather thou Celestial light Shine inward and the mind through all her powers Irradiate there plant eyes all mist from thence Purge and disperse that I may see and tell Of things invisible to mortal sight  Now had the Almighty Father from above From the pure Empyrean where he sits High Thrond above all highth bent down his eye His own works and their works at once to view About him all the Sanctities of Heaven Stood thick as Starrs and from his sight receivd Beatitude past utterance on his right The radiant image of his Glory sat His onely Son On Earth he first beheld Our two first Parents yet the onely two Of mankind in the happie Garden plact Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love Uninterrupted joy unrivald love In blissful solitude he then surveyd Hell and the Gulf between and Satan there Coasting the wall of Heavn on this side Night In the dun Air sublime and ready now To stoop with wearied wings and willing feet On the bare outside of this World that seemd Firm land imbosomd without Firmament Uncertain which in Ocean or in Air  Him God beholding from his prospect high Wherein past present future he beholds Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake  Onely begotten Son seest thou what rage Transports our adversarie whom no bounds Prescribd no barrs of Hell nor all the chains Heapt on him there nor yet the main Abyss Wide interrupt can hold so bent he seems On desparate reveng that shall redound Upon his own rebellious head    And now Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way Not farr off Heavn in the Precincts of light Directly towards the new created World And Man there plact with purpose to assay If him by force he can destroy or worse By some false guile pervert and shall pervert For man will harkn to his glozing lyes And easily transgress the sole Command Sole pledge of his obedience So will fall Hee and his faithless Progenie whose fault Whose but his own ingrate he had of mee All he could have I made him just and right Sufficient to have stood though free to fall  Such I created all th Ethereal Powers And Spirits both them who stood and them who faild Freely they stood who stood and fell who fell  Not free what proof could they have givn sincere Of true allegiance constant Faith or Love Where onely what they needs must do appeard Not what they would what praise could they receive What pleasure I from such obedience paid When Will and Reason Reason also is choice Useless and vain of freedom both despoild Made passive both had servd necessitie Not mee    They therefore as to right belongd So were created nor can justly accuse Thir maker or thir making or thir Fate As if predestination over-ruld Thir will disposd by absolute Decree Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed Thir own revolt not I if I foreknew Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault Which had no less provd certain unforeknown  So without least impulse or shadow of Fate Or aught by me immutablie foreseen They trespass Authors to themselves in all Both what they judge and what they choose for so I formd them free and free they must remain Till they enthrall themselves I else must change Thir nature and revoke the high Decree Unchangeable Eternal which ordaind Thir freedom they themselves ordaind thir fall  The first sort by thir own suggestion fell Self-tempted self-depravd Man falls deceivd By the other first Man therefore shall find grace The other none in Mercy and Justice both Through Heavn and Earth so shall my glorie excel But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine  Thus while God spake ambrosial fragrance filld All Heavn and in the blessed Spirits elect Sense of new joy ineffable diffusd Beyond compare the Son of God was seen Most glorious in him all his Father shon Substantially expressd and in his face Divine compassion visibly appeerd Love without end and without measure Grace Which uttering thus he to his Father spake  O Father gracious was that word which closd Thy sovran sentence that Man should find grace For which both Heavn and Earth shall high extoll Thy praises with th innumerable sound Of Hymns and sacred Songs wherewith thy Throne Encompassd shall resound thee ever blest  For should Man finally be lost should Man Thy creature late so lovd thy youngest Son Fall circumvented thus by fraud though joynd With his own folly that be from thee farr That farr be from thee Father who art Judg Of all things made and judgest onely right  Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain His end and frustrate thine shall he fulfill His malice and thy goodness bring to naught Or proud return though to his heavier doom Yet with revenge accomplisht and to Hell Draw after him the whole Race of mankind By him corrupted or wilt thou thy self Abolish thy Creation and unmake For him what for thy glorie thou hast made So should thy goodness and thy greatness both Be questiond and blaspheamd without defence  To whom the great Creatour thus replyd  O Son in whom my Soul hath chief delight Son of my bosom Son who art alone My word my wisdom and effectual might All hast thou spokn as my thoughts are all As my Eternal purpose hath decreed Man shall not quite be lost but savd who will Yet not of will in him but grace in me Freely voutsaft once more I will renew His lapsed powers though forfeit and enthralld By sin to foul exorbitant desires Upheld by me yet once more he shall stand On even ground against his mortal foe By me upheld that he may know how frail His falln condition is and to me ow All his delivrance and to none but me  Some I have chosen of peculiar grace Elect above the rest so is my will The rest shall hear me call and oft be warnd Thir sinful state and to appease betimes Th incensed Deitie while offerd grace Invites for I will cleer thir senses dark What may sufflce and softn stonie hearts To pray repent and bring obedience due  To Prayer repentance and obedience due Though but endevord with sincere intent Mine ear shall not be slow mine eye not shut  And I will place within them as a guide My Umpire Conscience whom if they will hear Light after light well usd they shall attain And to the end persisting safe arrive  This my long sufferance and my day of grace They who neglect and scorn shall never taste But hard be hardnd blind be blinded more That they may stumble on and deeper fall And none but such from mercy I exclude  But yet all is not don Man disobeying Disloyal breaks his fealtie and sinns Against the high Supremacie of Heavn Affecting God-head and so loosing all To expiate his Treason hath naught left But to destruction sacred and devote He with his whole posteritie must dye Dye hee or Justice must unless for him Som other able and as willing pay The rigid satisfaction death for death  Say Heavnly powers where shall we find such love Which of ye will be mortal to redeem Mans mortal crime and just th unjust to save Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare He askd but all the Heavnly Quire stood mute And silence was in Heavn on mans behalf Patron or Intercessor none appeerd Much less that durst upon his own head draw The deadly forfeiture and ransom set  And now without redemption all mankind Must have bin lost adjudgd to Death and Hell By doom severe had not the Son of God In whom the fulness dwels of love divine His dearest mediation thus renewd  Father thy word is past man shall find grace And shall grace not find means that finds her way The speediest of thy winged messengers To visit all thy creatures and to all Comes unprevented unimplord unsought Happie for man so coming he her aide Can never seek once dead in sins and lost Attonement for himself or offering meet Indebted and undon hath none to bring Behold mee then mee for him life for life I offer on mee let thine anger fall Account mee man I for his sake will leave Thy bosom and this glorie next to thee Freely put off and for him lastly dye Well pleasd on me let Death wreck all his rage Under his gloomie power I shall not long Lie vanquisht thou hast givn me to possess Life in my self for ever by thee I live Though now to Death I yield and am his due All that of me can die yet that debt paid Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave His prey nor suffer my unspotted Soule For ever with corruption there to dwell But I shall rise Victorious and subdue My vanquisher spoild of his vanted spoile Death his deaths wound shall then receive and stoop Inglorious of his mortall sting disarmd  I through the ample Air in Triumph high Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell and show The powers of darkness bound    Thou at the sight Pleasd out of Heaven shalt look down and smile While by thee raisd I ruin all my Foes Death last and with his Carcass glut the Grave Then with the multitude of my redeemd Shall enter Heaven long absent and returne Father to see thy face wherein no cloud Of anger shall remain but peace assurd And reconcilement wrauth shall be no more Thenceforth but in thy presence joy entire  His words here ended but his meek aspect Silent yet spake and breathd immortal love To mortal men above which only shon Filial obedience as a sacrifice Glad to be offerd he attends the will Of his great Father    Admiration seisd All Heavn what this might mean and whither tend Wondring but soon th Almighty thus replyd O thou in Heavn and Earth the only peace Found out for mankind under wrauth O thou My sole complacence well thou knowst how dear To me are all my works nor Man the least Though last created that for him I spare Thee from my bosom and right hand to save By loosing thee a while the whole Race lost  Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyn And be thy self Man among men on Earth Made flesh when time shall be of Virgin seed By wondrous birth Be thou in Adams room The Head of all mankind though Adams Son  As in him perish all men so in thee As from a second root shall be restord As many as are restord without thee none  His crime makes guiltie all his Sons thy merit Imputed shall absolve them who renounce Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds And live in thee transplanted and from thee Receive new life    So Man as is most just Shall satisfie for Man be judgd and die And dying rise and rising with him raise His Brethren ransomd with his own dear life  So Heavnly love shall outdoo Hellish hate Giving to death and dying to redeeme So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate So easily destroyd and still destroyes In those who when they may accept not grace  Nor shalt thou by descending to assume Mans Nature lessn or degrade thine owne  Because thou hast though Thrond in highest bliss Equal to God and equally enjoying God-like fruition quitted all to save A World from utter loss and hast been found By Merit more then Birthright Son of God Found worthiest to be so by being Good Farr more then Great or High because in thee Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne Here shalt thou sit incarnate here shalt Reign Both God and Man Son both of God and Man Anointed universal King all Power I give thee reign for ever and assume Thy Merits under thee as Head Supream Thrones Princedoms Powers Dominions I reduce All knees to thee shall bow of them that bide In Heaven or Earth or under Earth in Hell When thou attended gloriously from Heavn Shalt in the Sky appeer and from thee send The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime Thy dread Tribunal forthwith from all Windes The living and forthwith the cited dead Of all past Ages to the general Doom Shall hastn such a peal shall rouse thir sleep  Then all thy Saints assembld thou shalt judge Bad men and Angels they arraignd shall sink Beneath thy Sentence Hell her numbers full Thenceforth shall be for ever shut    Mean while The World shall burn and from her ashes spring New Heavn and Earth wherein the just shall dwell And after all thir tribulations long See golden days fruitful of golden deeds With Joy and Love triumphing and fair Truth  Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by For regal Scepter then no more shall need God shall be All in All    But all ye Gods Adore him who to compass all this dies Adore the Son and honour him as mee  No sooner had th Almighty ceast but all The multitude of Angels with a shout Loud as from numbers without number sweet As from blest voices uttering joy Heavn rung With Jubilee and loud Hosannas filld Th eternal Regions lowly reverent Towards either Throne they bow and to the ground With solemn adoration down they cast Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold Immortal Amarant a Flour which once In Paradise fast by the Tree of Life Began to bloom but soon for mans offence To Heavn removd where first it grew there grows And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn Rowls ore Elisian Flours her Amber stream With these that never fade the Spirits elect Bind thir resplendent locks inwreathd with beams Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off the bright Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon Impurpld with Celestial Roses smild  Then Crownd again thir goldn Harps they took Harps ever tund that glittering by thir side Like Quivers hung and with Praeamble sweet Of charming symphonie they introduce Thir sacred Song and waken raptures high No voice exempt no voice but well could joine Melodious part such concord is in Heavn  Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent Immutable Immortal Infinite Eternal King thee Author of all being Fountain of Light thy self invisible Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sitst Thrond inaccessible but when thou shadst The full blaze of thy beams and through a cloud Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer Yet dazle Heavn that brightest Seraphim Approach not but with both wings veil thir eyes  Thee next they sang of all Creation first Begotten Son Divine Similitude In whose conspicuous countnance without cloud Made visible th Almighty Father shines Whom else no Creature can behold on thee Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides Transfusd on thee his ample Spirit rests  Hee Heavn of Heavens and all the Powers therein By thee created and by thee threw down Th aspiring Dominations thou that day Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels that shook Heavns everlasting Frame while ore the necks Thou drovst of warring Angels disarraid  Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime Thee only extolld Son of thy Fathers might To execute fierce vengeance on his foes Not so on Man him through their malice falln Father of Mercie and Grace thou didst not doome So strictly but much more to pitie encline No sooner did thy dear and onely Son Perceive thee purposd not to doom frail Man So strictly but much more to pitie enclind He to appease thy wrauth and end the strife Of Mercy and justice in thy face discernd Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat Second to thee offerd himself to die For mans offence    O unexampld love Love no where to be found less then Divine Hail Son of God Saviour of Men thy Name Shall be the copious matter of my Song Henceforth and never shall my Harp thy praise Forget nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine  Thus they in Heavn above the starry Sphear Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent  Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe Of this round World whose first convex divides The luminous inferior Orbs enclosd From Chaos and th inroad of Darkness old Satan alighted walks a Globe farr off It seemd now seems a boundless Continent Dark waste and wild under the frown of Night Starless exposd and ever-threatning storms Of Chaos blustring round inclement skie Save on that side which from the wall of Heavn Though distant farr som small reflection gaines Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud Here walkd the Fiend at large in spacious field  As when a Vultur on Imaus bred Whose snowie ridge the roving Tartar bounds Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids On Hills where Flocks are fed flies toward the Springs Of Ganges or Hydaspes Indian streams But in his way lights on the barren Plaines Of Sericana where Chineses drive With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light So on this windie Sea of Land the Fiend Walkd up and down alone bent on his prey Alone for other Creature in this place Living or liveless to be found was none None yet but store hereafter from the earth Up hither like Aereal vapours flew Of all things transitorie and vain when Sin With vanity had filld the works of men Both all things vain and all who in vain things Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame Or happiness in this or th other life All who have thir reward on Earth the fruits Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal Naught seeking but the praise of men here find Fit retribution emptie as thir deeds All th unaccomplisht works of Natures hand Abortive monstrous or unkindly mixt Dissolvd on Earth fleet hither and in vain Till final dissolution wander here Not in the neighbouring Moon as some have dreamd Those argent Fields more likely habitants Translated Saints or middle Spirits hold Betwixt th Angelical and Human kinde Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born First from the ancient World those Giants came With many a vain exploit though then renownd The builders next of Babel on the Plain Of Sennaar and still with vain designe New Babels had they wherewithall would build Others came single he who to be deemd A God leapd fondly into Aetna flames Empedocles and hee who to enjoy Platos Elysium leapd into the Sea Cleombrotus and many more too long Embryos and Idiots Eremits and Friers White Black and Grey with all thir trumperie  Here Pilgrims roam that strayd so farr to seek In Golgotha him dead who lives in Heavn And they who to be sure of Paradise Dying put on the weeds of Dominic Or in Franciscan think to pass disguisd They pass the Planets seven and pass the fixt And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs The Trepidation talkt and that first movd And now Saint Peter at Heavns Wicket seems To wait them with his Keys and now at foot Of Heavns ascent they lift thir Feet when loe A violent cross wind from either Coast Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry Into the devious Air then might ye see Cowles Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost And flutterd into Raggs then Reliques Beads Indulgences Dispenses Pardons Bulls The sport of Winds all these upwhirld aloft Fly ore the backside of the World farr off Into a Limbo large and broad since calld The Paradise of Fools to few unknown Long after now unpeopld and untrod All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he passd And long he wanderd till at last a gleame Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste His travelld steps farr distant he descries Ascending by degrees magnificent Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high At top whereof but farr more rich appeerd The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold Imbellisht thick with sparkling orient Gemmes The Portal shon inimitable on Earth By Model or by shading Pencil drawn  The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw Angels ascending and descending bands Of Guardians bright when he from Esau fled To Padan-Aram in the field of Luz Dreaming by night under the open Skie And waking crid This is the Gate of Heavn  Each Stair mysteriously was meant nor stood There alwayes but drawn up to Heavn somtimes Viewless and underneath a bright Sea flowd Of Jasper or of liquid Pearle whereon Who after came from Earth sayling arrivd Wafted by Angels or flew ore the Lake Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds  The Stairs were then let down whether to dare The Fiend by easie ascent or aggravate His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss  Direct against which opnd from beneath Just ore the blissful seat of Paradise A passage down to th Earth a passage wide Wider by farr then that of after-times Over Mount Sion and though that were large Over the Promisd Land to God so dear By which to visit oft those happy Tribes On high behests his Angels to and fro Passd frequent and his eye with choice regard From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood To Beersaba where the Holy Land Borders on Aegypt and the Arabian shoare So wide the opning seemd where bounds were set To darkness such as bound the Ocean wave  Satan from hence now on the lower stair That scald by steps of Gold to Heavn Gate Looks down with wonder at the sudden view Of all this World at once    As when a Scout Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone All night at last by break of chearful dawne Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill Which to his eye discovers unaware The goodly prospect of some forein land First-seen or some renownd Metropolis With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams  Such wonder seisd though after Heaven seen The Spirit maligne but much more envy seisd At sight of all this World beheld so faire  Round he surveys and well might where he stood So high above the circling Canopie Of Nights extended shade from Eastern Point Of Libra to the fleecie Starr that bears Andromeda farr off Atlantic Seas Beyond th Horizon then from Pole to Pole He views in bredth and without longer pause Down right into the Worlds first Region throws His flight precipitant and windes with ease Through the pure marble Air his oblique way Amongst innumerable Starrs that shon Stars distant but nigh hand seemd other Worlds Or other Worlds they seemd or happy Iles Like those Hesperian Gardens famd of old Fortunate Fields and Groves and flourie Vales Thrice happy Iles but who dwelt happy there He stayd not to enquire above them all The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven Allurd his eye Thither his course he bends Through the calm Firmament but up or downe By center or eccentric hard to tell Or Longitude where the great Luminarie Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick That from his Lordly eye keep distance due Dispenses Light from farr they as they move Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute Days months  years towards his all-chearing Lamp Turn swift thir various motions or are turnd By his Magnetic beam that gently warms The Univers and to each inward part With gentle penetration though unseen Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep So wondrously was set his Station bright  There lands the Fiend a spot like which perhaps Astronomer in the Suns lucent Orbe Through his glazd Optic Tube yet never saw  The place he found beyond expression bright Compard with aught on Earth Medal or Stone Not all parts like but all alike informd With radiant light as glowing Iron with fire If mettal part seemd Gold part Silver cleer If stone Carbuncle most or Chrysolite Rubie or Topaz to the Twelve that shon In Aarons Brest-plate and a stone besides Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen That stone or like to that which here below Philosophers in vain so long have sought In vain though by thir powerful Art they binde Volatil Hermes and call up unbound In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme  What wonder then if fields and regions here Breathe forth Elixir pure and Rivers run Potable Gold when with one vertuous touch Th Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt Here in the dark so many precious things Of colour glorious and effect so rare Here matter new to gaze the Devil met Undazld farr and wide his eye commands For sight no obstacle found here nor shade But all Sun-shine as when his Beams at Noon Culminate from th Aequator as they now Shot upward still direct whence no way round Shadow from body opaque can fall and the Aire No where so cleer sharpnd his visual ray To objects distant farr whereby he soon Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand The same whom John saw also in the Sun His back was turnd but not his brightness hid Of beaming sunnie Raies a golden tiar Circld his Head nor less his Locks behind Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings Lay waving round on som great charge imployd He seemd or fixt in cogitation deep  Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope To find who might direct his wandring flight To Paradise the happie seat of Man His journies end and our beginning woe  But first he casts to change his proper shape Which else might work him danger or delay And now a stripling Cherube he appeers Not of the prime yet such as in his face Youth smild Celestial and to every Limb Sutable grace diffusd so well he feignd Under a Coronet his flowing haire In curles on either cheek plaid wings he wore Of many a colourd plume sprinkld with Gold His habit fit for speed succinct and held Before his decent steps a Silver wand  He drew not nigh unheard the Angel bright Ere he drew nigh his radiant visage turnd Admonisht by his ear and strait was known Th Arch-Angel Uriel one of the seavn Who in Gods presence neerest to his Throne Stand ready at command and are his Eyes That run through all the Heavns or down to th Earth Bear his swift errands over moist and dry Ore Sea and Land him Satan thus accostes Uriel for thou of those seavn Spirits that stand In sight of Gods high Throne gloriously bright The first art wont his great authentic will Interpreter through highest Heavn to bring Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend And here art likeliest by supream decree Like honour to obtain and as his Eye To visit oft this new Creation round Unspeakable desire to see and know All these his wondrous works but chiefly Man His chief delight and favour him for whom All these his works so wondrous he ordaind Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim Alone thus wandring    Brightest Seraph tell In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man His fixed seat or fixed seat hath none But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell That I may find him and with secret gaze Or open admiration him behold On whom the great Creator hath bestowd Worlds and on whom hath all these graces powrd That both in him and all things as is meet The Universal Maker we may praise Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes To deepest Hell and to repair that loss Created this new happie Race of Men To serve him better wise are all his wayes  So spake the false dissembler unperceivd For neither Man nor Angel can discern Hypocrisie the onely evil that walks Invisible except to God alone By his permissive will through Heavn and Earth And oft though wisdom wake suspicion sleeps At wisdoms Gate and to simplicitie Resigns her charge while goodness thinks no ill Where no ill seems Which now for once beguild Uriel though Regent of the Sun and held The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heavn Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule In his uprightness answer thus returnd  Fair Angel thy desire which tends to know The works of God thereby to glorifie The great Work-Maister leads to no excess That reaches blame but rather merits praise The more it seems excess that led thee hither From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps Contented with report hear onely in heavn For wonderful indeed are all his works Pleasant to know and worthiest to be all Had in remembrance alwayes with delight But what created mind can comprehend Thir number or the wisdom infinite That brought them forth but hid thir causes deep  I saw when at his Word the formless Mass This worlds material mould came to a heap Confusion heard his voice and wilde uproar Stood ruld stood vast infinitude confind Till at his second bidding darkness fled Light shon and order from disorder sprung Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then The cumbrous Elements Earth Flood Aire Fire And this Ethereal quintessence of Heavn Flew upward spirited with various forms That rowld orbicular and turnd to Starrs Numberless as thou seest and how they move Each had his place appointed each his course The rest in circuit walles this Universe  Look downward on that Globe whose hither side With light from hence though but reflected shines That place is Earth the seat of Man that light His day which else as th other Hemisphere Night would invade but there the neighbouring Moon So call that opposite fair Starr her aide Timely interposes and her monthly round Still ending still renewing through mid Heavn With borrowd light her countenance triform Hence fills and empties to enlighten th Earth And in her pale dominion checks the night  That spot to which I point is Paradise Adams abode those loftie shades his Bowre  Thy way thou canst not miss me mine requires  Thus said he turnd and Satan bowing low As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven Where honour due and reverence none neglects Took leave and toward the coast of Earth beneath Down from th Ecliptic sped with hopd success Throws his steep flight in many an Aerie wheele Nor staid till on Niphates top he lights
