
In a patch of sunlight
a decapitated grasshopper
twitches  The sunlight twitches 
Sky the size of a sky imagined 
 
Squint to see the quarter moon
 shallow gash on blue horizon 
Squint to hear beyond windows
wafting muzak  I’m half-awake
 
in this field of turned-on particulars 
A wreck of yellow blossoms
under a barn-door window 
 
A barn door without the barn
