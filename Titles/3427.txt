The year and its
    as like as eggs
        the days
in their crates of season
    we break open
        and the yolk
of fresh sun we scramble
    the runny light into
        a firm
break
    of the nights winter
        helping of the fast 
                      
Yellow dishes 
        forsythia
    set out for the early
            meal of season 
sit the house    yards
        the town
    parks    down together
            to this spring as
to a table
        all set
    in order    just
            So
good to see
        you and
    your way found
            back 
​                      
The arriving coats of smell
    are hung in the air butt-smacked and
        oiled babies of moment
and years of taste as touch
    hug    the senses
        to the living
sweet sour bitter salty
    some never experienced
        again the gloved fingers
of bananas    so briefly kissed
    with ripeness fruit
        grip-shaped thought
brought to the tongue
    the finished taste
        of words    an aftertaste
of silence    the morning
    glories we havent tasted
        yet
​                      
life as lasting as any one
    sense a taste
        a sight an orange mix
of kiss with sweetness
    for the moment
        it exists finishes and
is swallowed is also those
    who finish hungry or starve
        to death    which swallows
the final stage of rattlesnake bite
    is yellow vision
        light    then you both go out 
Fear to the tongue is metallic I tasted
    a copper penny    it could have been
        a one-time and final incomparable
         How does life taste
        to one condemned
            in that cup    this morning
