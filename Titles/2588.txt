Sit on the bed Im blind and three parts shell  Be careful cant shake hands now never shall  Both arms have mutinied against me brutes  My fingers fidget like ten idle brats  I tried to peg out soldierly no use One dies of war like any old disease  This bandage feels like pennies on my eyes  I have my medals Discs to make eyes close  My glorious ribbons Ripped from my own back In scarlet shreds  Thats for your poetry book  A short life and a merry one my buck We used to say wed hate to live dead-old  Yet now     Id willingly be puffy bald And patriotic  Buffers catch from boys At least the jokes hurled at them  I suppose Little Id ever teach a son but hitting Shooting war hunting all the arts of hurting  Well thats what I learnt that and making money  Your fifty years ahead seem none too many Tell me how long Ive got God For one year To help myself to nothing more than air One Spring Is one too good to spare too long Spring wind would work its own way to my lung And grow me legs as quick as lilac-shoots  My servants lamed but listen how he shouts When Im lugged out hell still be good for that  Here in this mummy-case you know Ive thought How well I might have swept his floors for ever  Id ask no night off when the bustles over Enjoying so the dirt  Whos prejudiced Against a grimed hand when his owns quite dust Less live than specks that in the sun-shafts turn Less warm than dust that mixes with arms tan Id love to be a sweep now black as Town Yes or a muckman  Must I be his loadO Life Life let me breathe a dug-out rat Not worse than ours the lives rats lead  Nosing along at night down some safe rut They find a shell-proof home before they rot  Dead men may envy living mites in cheese Or good germs even  Microbes have their joys And subdivide and never come to death  Certainly flowers have the easiest time on earth  “I shall be one with nature herb and stone” Shelley would tell me  Shelley would be stunned The dullest Tommy hugs that fancy now  “Pushing up daisies” is their creed you know  To grain then go my fat to buds my sap For all the usefulness there is in soap  Dyou think the Boche will ever stew man-soup Some day no doubt if                                                    Friend be very sure I shall be better off with plants that share More peaceably the meadow and the shower  Soft rains will touch me  as they could touch once And nothing but the sun shall make me ware  Your guns may crash around me  Ill not hear Or if I wince I shall not know I wince  Dont take my souls poor comfort for your jest  Soldiers may grow a soul when turned to fronds But here the things best left at home with friends  My souls a little grief grappling your chest To climb your throat on sobs easily chased On other sighs and wiped by fresher winds  Carry my crying spirit till its weaned To do without what blood remained these wounds
