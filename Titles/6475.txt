
By way of my mother the deacon with the slick gray hair and money
clip in his pocket can claim a percentage of my body like tithe rights 
And on this Sunday as with every other Sunday he is a slender
ebony panel in the fence of faith one man in the company of men
standing shoulder to shoulder in suits tapping their toes clapping
their hands putting muscle to work in the making of praise music 
We Baptists call this devotion my working definition of which
is faithfulness to the light  To the extent that God is as white
as the clouds of heaven this theory holds  To the extent these
particular men are dark I must consider other possibilities
that God remade himself in my image so that we could be closer
or that devotion means the commitment of black men to stand
with one another
