
When you open the door everything falls into place 
the little ferry by the wharf fir trees and thujas    
An old woman feeding ducks seems as old as Leni   
Riefenstahl  At the base of the hill chestnut trees not yet in full bloom   
are younger but probably as old as her films    
All is wet and bright  A hedgehog or God-knows-whose-soul   
is rummaging in last years leaves  Dead water and living water   
fill the plain  The twins Celsius and Fahrenheit   
are predicting spring weather while a shadow obscures   
the past just like the present  The first serene weeks scour the bridges   
in a peaceful corner of Europe between Wannsee and Potsdam where   
much has happened but probably nothing more will    
For days we have been watching a ragged crow in the garden   
sometimes on the roof  The ancients would have said her   
stubbornness augurs something  Emerging from the woods   
depths she lights on one antenna crossbar   
then another her surface bright as mercury   
in a thermometers glass  But these are fever marks   
we are incapable of understanding  The beginning of agony   
The past does not enlighten us but still it attempts   
to say something  Perhaps the crow knows more about us   
and about historys dirt than we do ourselves    
Of what does she want to remind us Of the black photos the black headphones
of radio operators black signatures under documents   
of the unarmed with their frozen pupils of the prisoners boot or the trunk   
of the refugee Probably not  We will remember this anyway   
though it wont make us any wiser  The bird signifies only stoicism   
and patience  If you ask for them your request will be granted
