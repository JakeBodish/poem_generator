
What I’ve come to discuss is mostly about shadows
and the airs left behind in caring discarding
the long inhibitions of whereso and when 
Alabaster a dark quire in its many pages and premises
the maze from which move
tendrilled purples and contusions magnificent
fuchsia receivers of false content
the splayed flower arterial like the premise of a door
is where it leads to or from  Communication
of vessel vial capsule hull a tiniest nil
fires the neurons from their swooning stall
is not a healing but adaptation to same
a quickening in deleting of sensation
a prior sizing  Stacked leaves green shadows
are givens in the columned garden what work is needed
to determine that shape Some hysteric
trope of repetition rage for accretion
dazed by its own mute replication
like the minute lines of a hand  They are
its cries writes Ponge among others
the tongue inseparable from its utterance langue 
We weep to hear it a language forgot 
I was saying I keep speaking
from some chamber sound deleted which is why
I never call or write  In that theatre are many eclipses
and moons refracted in pinholes and wheels
wherein revolve astonished birds and the Queen of Night
sleeps a rest restorative and profitable and
andante allegro the dead ships never sail
