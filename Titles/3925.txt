
Except another black girl was with me 
Mother  Always lonely  I am always 
Mother those girls  Forty-two 
March summer  Light blue  Vermont 
Endless crescent  Invert as a tyke lake 
Fernet Mother Im grown  Forest 
San Francisco  Lone cold 
Stone turd  Talk three or none 
Kidding 
Kidding
