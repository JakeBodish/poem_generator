glare that whitened its edgesbent the bars  Waters apart from society by choice their living room the aftermath of accident or crime  When the storm comeswe will see into it there will be no near and no far  In sixty-five-foot  seasfor the Ocean Ranger green turned to black then white as moleculeschanged places in the Jeanne d’Arc Basin the way wood passes intoflame and communication errors into catastrophic failurefor the Piper Alpha offshore from Aberdeen It burned freely  If I don’t come home is my house in orderBig fear travels in the Sikorsky  Twelve-hour shifts travel with them the deluge system aqueous foam  Machinery’s one notehammering the heart identity compressed with intentions drenchedthe tired body performs delicately timed brutal tasks no trainingadequately represents and which consume the perceivable world In beds on the drilling platform in suspended disbeliefidentified by the unlovely sea’s aggression no sleep aidsshould a directive come  Underwater welders deeply unconscious Survival suits profane in lockers  By dreams of marine flaresand inflatables buoyant smoke percolating fretone is weakened  Violence enters the imagination Clouds previously unrecorded  Unlocked the gates of lightand technology of capture in bitumen oozing from fracturesin the earth or afloat like other fatty bodies condensedby sun and internal salts harassing snakes with its fumes Light-sensitive bitumen of Judea upon which Joseph-Nicéphore Niépcerecorded the view from his bedroom  It looked nice  A new kindof evidence developed from the camera obscura of experienceand memory love-object to dote on and ignore  Collectible photochrome postcards  Storm surge as weather segmenttornados on YouTube relieve us of our boredom  In the rain drizzle intermittent showers unseasonable hurricane threatening our flight plans against a sea heaving photogenically straining at its chains like a monster in the flashbulbs on wet stones astonishingly slick we take selfies post them and can’t undo it Meaning takes place in time  By elevated circumstance of Burtynsky’s drone helicopters revolutionary lenses pester Alberta’s tar sands sulphur ponds’ rhapsodic upturned faces photographs that happen in our name and in the name of composition  Foreground entered at distance the eye surveils the McMurray Formation’s freestanding ruin mid-aspect to an infinity of abstraction  A physical symptom assails our vocabulary and things acquire a literal feeling from which one does not recover  Mineral dissolution complete  Accommodation space low  Confinement relatively broad extremely complex stratigraphy reservoirs stacked and composite  An area roughly the sizeof England stripped of boreal forest and muskeg unburdened by hydraulic rope shovels of its overburden  Humiliatedblinded walking in circles  Cycle of soak and dry and residue  The will creates effects no will can overturn and that seem with the passage of time necessary as the past assumes a pattern  Thought approaches the future and the future like a heavy unconventional oil advances  Hello infrastructure Dodge Ram 1500 no one else wants to get killed on Highway 63 the all-weather road by the Wandering River where earthmovers remain unmoved by our schedules  White crosses in the ditches white crosses in the glove box  The west stands for relocation the east for lost causes  Would you conspire to serve tourists in a fish restaurant the rest of your life I thought not  Drinks are on us bushpigs now though this camp is no place for a tradesman  Devon’s Jackfish is five-star an obvious exception  But Mackenzie Voyageur Millennium Borealis  years ago we would have burned them to the ground  Suncor Firebag has Wi-Fi but will track usage  Guard towers and turnstiles at Wapasu  we’re guests after all not prisoners right Efficiently squalid briskly producing raw sewage black mold botulism fleas remorse madness lethargy mud it’s not a spiritual home this bleach taste in the waterglass layered garments fried food bitter complaint in plywood drop-ceiling bedrooms strung outon whatever and general offense and why doesn’t anyone smoke anymore  Dealers and prostitutes cultivate their terms organically as demand matures  The Athabasca River’s color isn’t good Should we not encourage a healthy dread of the wild placesConsider the operator crushed by a slab of ice our electrician mauled by a bear at the front lines of project expansioninto the inhumane forest  Fear not we are worth more than many sparrows They pay for insignificance with their lives  It’s the structure Jackpine Mine photographs beautifully on the shoulders of the dayin the minutes before sunset it’s still legal to hunt  One mightlike Caspar David Friedrich’s Wanderer at a certain removefrom principal events cut a sensitive figure in the presenceof the sublime  Except you can smell it down here  Corrosivevapors unexpectedly distributed caustic particulate infiltratesyour mood  As does the tar sands beetle whose bite scars from whomgrown men run  Attracted by the same sorrowful chemical compoundemitted by damaged trees on which it feeds its aural signatureapproximates the rasp of causatum rubbing its parts together The only other living thing in situ in the open pit where swims the bitumen extra brilliant dense massive in the Greek asphaltos“to make stable” “to secure ” Pharmacist’s earth that resists decayresolves and attenuates cleanses wounds  Once used to burnthe houses of our enemies upgraded now to refinery-ready feedstockraw crude flowing through channels of production and distribution  Combustion is our style  It steers all things from the black graveof Athabasca-Wabiskaw  Cold Lake  Rail lines ofLac-Mégantic  The optics are bad  We’re all downstream now Action resembles waiting for a decision madeon our behalf then despair after the fact  Despair whichlike bitumen itself applied to render darker tones or an emphatictenebrism imparts a velvety lustrous dispositionbut eventually discolors to a black treacle that degradesany pigment it contacts  Details in sections of Raft of the Medusacan no longer be discerned  In 1816 the Medusa’s captainin a spasm of flamboyant incompetence ran agroundon the African coast and fearing the ire of his constituentsrefused to sacrifice the cannons  They turned on each other147 low souls herded onto a makeshift raft cut loose from lifeboatsof the wealthy and well-connected  The signs were thereriskreward coefficient alive in the wind the locomotivesmall tragic towns left for work where the only thing manufactured is the need for work  Foreshortening and a receding horizoninclude the viewer in the scene should the viewer wishto be included in the scene  One can’t be sure if the brig Argusis racing to the rescue or departing  It hesitates in the distancein its nimbus of fairer weather the courage and compassionof a new age onboard  Géricault’s pyramidical composition  dead and dying in the foreground from which the strong succeed upwardtoward an emotional peak  an influence for Turner’s Disaster at Sea the vortex structure ofThe Slave Ship all those abandoned where is thy market nowIt’s difficult to imagine everyone saved it’s unaffordable  Wavesdisproportionate organized in depth panic modulatingthe speaking voice  The situation so harshly primary and not beautifulwhen you don’t go to visit the seaside but the seaside visits yourudely breaks in through the basement ascends stairsto your bedroom you can’t think of it generally then  The  constitutionof things is accustomed to hiding  Rearrangement will not suit us Certain low-lying river deltas  Island states coastal regions  floodwaters receding in measures like all we haven’t seen the last ofreveal in stagnancies and bloat what’s altered as avernal exhalationsof mines and flares are altered but don’t disappear  Stilliceberg season is spectacular this year worth the tripto photograph in evening
