
didnt thank
didnt wave goodbye
didnt flutter the air with kisses
a mound of gifts unwrapped
bed unmade
no appetite
always elsewhere
though it was raining elsewhere
though strangers peopled the streets
though we at home slaved and
baked and wept and
hung ornaments
and perfumed the dark
did he marvel
did he thank
was he grateful        did he know
was he human
was he there
always elsewhere
didnt thank
didnt kiss
toothbrush stiffened with unuse
puppy whining in the hall
car battery dead
sweaters unraveled
was that human
Went where
