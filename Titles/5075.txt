
Silent about-to-be-parted-from house Wood creaking trying to sigh impatient Clicking of squirrel-teeth in the attic Denuded beds couches stripped of serapes Deep snow shall block all entrancesand oppress the roof and darkenthe windows     O Laresdon’t leave The house yawns like a bear Guard its profound dreams for usthat it return to us when we return November 1969
