
Speeding without destination after dark
torrents have poured  been returned
at home the skies above mirror my mood
windshield wipers knifing through sheets
back roads slick with pooling when a shard
of cloudlessness opens  Pulling over cutting
the ignition I unstitch myself from the humid
seat still fuming to greet a full spectrum
of color arcing past the treetops in lockstep
with its fainter inverse  Archers bow hem
of the sun gods coat bridge between worlds
reconciliation  pardon  They dont last
