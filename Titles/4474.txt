
She steps into La Roue de la Fortune movie theater
off the Jersey Turnpike buys a ticket
and so swiftly the waters roll
above her instinctual visions Plaza Il Piazzo
creep of film over the sound of the wordspiano purr whisper across her neck
one door opens another
in the labyrinthine pitch to preserve
order the expulsion from Eden the dark
soda up her clear plastic straw reels
of rodents popcorn teenage workers
acne blood and circulation turn to ice
inside this mechanized paradise
where reality meets the sound of gardens
growing past their makers’ dreams
growing strange and outrageous 
She stops to check her phone
and the phone lights up Putin BotoxTrump the garden grows outward up
to each side the ghosts are simply
plants who forgot to stop growing
they groan shriek quake giggle gurgle
stare and point fingers at the living I’m glad I’m in love she thinks
