Friends Romans countrymen lend me your earsI come to bury Caesar not to praise him The evil that men do lives after themThe good is oft interred with their bonesSo let it be with Caesar  The noble BrutusHath told you Caesar was ambitiousIf it were so it was a grievous faultAnd grievously hath Caesar answer’d it Here under leave of Brutus and the rest–For Brutus is an honourable manSo are they all all honourable men–Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral He was my friend faithful and just to meBut Brutus says he was ambitiousAnd Brutus is an honourable man He hath brought many captives home to RomeWhose ransoms did the general coffers fillDid this in Caesar seem ambitiousWhen that the poor have cried Caesar hath weptAmbition should be made of sterner stuffYet Brutus says he was ambitiousAnd Brutus is an honourable man You all did see that on the LupercalI thrice presented him a kingly crownWhich he did thrice refuse was this ambitionYet Brutus says he was ambitiousAnd sure he is an honourable man I speak not to disprove what Brutus spokeBut here I am to speak what I do know You all did love him once not without causeWhat cause withholds you then to mourn for himO judgment thou art fled to brutish beastsAnd men have lost their reason  Bear with meMy heart is in the coffin there with CaesarAnd I must pause till it come back to me
