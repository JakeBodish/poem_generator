
I thought of Thee my partner and my guideAs being past away  Vain sympathiesFor backward Duddon as I cast my eyesI see what was and is and will abideStill glides the Stream and shall for ever glideThe Form remains the Function never diesWhile we the brave the mighty and the wiseWe Men who in our morn of youth defiedThe elements must vanish be it soEnough if something from our hands have powerTo live and act and serve the future hourAnd if as toward the silent tomb we goThrough love through hope and faiths transcendent dowerWe feel that we are greater than we know
