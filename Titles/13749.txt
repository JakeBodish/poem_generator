
Was it becauseat lastI cleaned the windowthat he threw himselfagainst the glassI thought poor crow he doesnt knowthe evergreensand blue skyare behind him I turned backto my pagebut whumpp the bird attackedthe glass again His long clawsscuffled at the paneand I yelled CrowGo awayAgain his body slappedthe glassagainand then againand then at lasthe caught my eye oh prophetterrified
