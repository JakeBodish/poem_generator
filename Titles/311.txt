
She was my Sunday school teacher
when I was just seven and eight 
He was the newly hired pastor
 
an albino alarming sight
with his transparent eyelashes
and mouse-pink skin that looked like it
 
might hurt whenever she caressed
his arm  Since Eva was her name
to my child’s mind it made great sense
 
that she should fall in love with him 
He was Adán  Before the Fall
and afterward her invert twin 
 
And she Eva was blonde as well
though more robust like Liv Ullmann 
I loved her honey hair her full
 
lips her green eyes a nameless sin 
Not that I worried all that much 
the church was Presbyterian 
 
In Sunday school her way to teach
us kids to pray was to comment
on all the beauty we could touch
 
or see in our environment 
My hand was always in the air
to volunteer my sentiment 
 
Since other kids considered prayer
a chore the floor was usually mine 
My list of joys left out her hair
 
but blessed the red hibiscus seen
through the windows while others bowed
their heads  Her heart I schemed to win
 
with purple prose on meringue clouds 
 For who was Adán anyway
I thought but nada spelled backward
 
While hers reversed called out Ave Ave The lyric of a bird
born and airborne on the same day 
 
But it was night when I saw her
outside the church for the last time
yellow light mosquitoes summer 
 
I shaped a barking dog a fine
but disembodied pair of wings
with my hands  She spoke in hushed tones
 
to my parents  The next day I would find
myself up north in a strange house
without my tongue and almost blind
 
there was so much to see  This caused
Cuba my past to be eclipsed
in time but Eva stayed a loss 
 Ave I learned meant also thisFarewell I haven’t seen her since
