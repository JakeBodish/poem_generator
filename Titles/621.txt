
Each night after reading three books to my two children 
we each picked one to unwind them into dreamland
Id turn off the light and sit between their beds
in the wide junk-shop rocker Id reupholstered blue
still feeling the close-reading warmth of their bodies beside me
and ask them to talk about the day we did thiswe did that sometimes leading somewhere sometimes
not but always ending up at the happy ending of now Now in still darkness listening to their breath slow and ease
into sleeps regular rhythm 
                                            Grown now you mightve guessed 
The past tense solid unyielding against the acidic drip
of recent years  But how it calmed us then rewinding
the gentle loop and in the trusting darkness pressing play
