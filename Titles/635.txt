To disappear Black girls at a low volume of sustained public panic is to insinuate the inconstancy of Black girls  The disposability of Black girls who are prone to disappearance  A body bag somewhere waits with little hoopla about its lot  Absence becomes the lot of Black girls 
 
 will eventually accept as fact that absence becomes a lot of Black girls  In what becomes the normal day-to-day Black girls are harder to find  would think first not that there are few attempts to find them  The question isn’t whether Black girls often go missing  If no one else Black girls miss each other 
 
  would be remiss to not recognize how everything is made less in the absence of Black girls if  could miss what  have never been required to recognize such as
 
Unlike missing Black girls taking Black girls is a Western custom  It seems likely that such a statement will soon appear inaccurate the white space in new textbook editions will have nothing to say about it if the white spaces behind those textbooks have anything to say about it  That Black girls are quintessential American palimpsests is not a question but an anxiety   would rather forget that Black girls were made receptacles for what the authors of Liberty and Independence would not speak  That Liberty and Independence were imaginable only in the absent-presence of taken Black girls enslaved Black girls Black girls on whom a foundational economic system so depended that white men would kill each other and take taken Black girls 
 
The constancy of Black girls is someone’s anxiety  The soil is thick with hidden Black girls the myth that only quiet Black girls are worthwhile Black girls  The soil turns as   turn away from loud Black girls and their cacophonic insistence on Black girls 
 
 have not insisted enough upon the fact of Black girls are often loudly shocked to find Black girls disappeared  Loud unsustainable shock has a way of disappearing Black girls  Outrage too has a way of being disappeared
