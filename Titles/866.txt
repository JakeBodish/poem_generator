
An evil spirit your beauty haunts me stillWherewith alas I have been long possessdWhich ceaseth not to tempt me to each illNor gives me once but one poor minutes rest In me it speaks whether I sleep or wakeAnd when by means to drive it out I tryWith greater torments then it me doth takeAnd tortures me in most extremity Before my face it lays down my despairsAnd hastes me on unto a sudden deathNow tempting me to drown myself in tearsAnd then in sighing to give up my breath Thus am I still provokd to every evilBy this good-wicked spirit sweet angel-devil
