
Complete in ourselves
we look like scraps of paper anywayleft alone we could tell
our mothers and one another our owners’flimsiest secrets and play together all dayuntil we became intertwined which is why
you tryto keep us permanently apart 
One of us is a gossamer pirate shipa frigate whose rigging the industrialsunset highlights sail by oblong sail 
Another resembles a Greek letter   gammaor lambda others still
a ligature a propeller a fat lip Our will is not exactly the wind’s will 
Underlined by sandwhose modes of coagulation and cohabitation
none of the human pedestrians understand
we take off on our almost arbitrarilylengthy singletons of stringtowards the unattainable scarily
lofty realm of hawk and albatrossand stay backlit by cirrocumulus It seems to be up to you
to keep usup in the air and to make sure our paths never cross
