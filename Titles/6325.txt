Is there no when where this dream will restBlue smoke wings a plague
of  walls the city motionless massof mind and angst rising
in the brilliance of a cloudless lightle ciel c’est mauve comme la lavande 
Everything turns in the quiet leisure of disastera kind of innocence
now supernatural darkness floatingtrees shaking waterways
swollen under a livid sky storm cloudsforming in the blink of an eye 
The thought of you is performative blondehair pale complexion downcast
jewels for eyes  Your dreadful martyrdomruns its course written in mud
and butter the human instant in whichyou sing yourself full-throated 
Honey ginger flared saffron graywhitemomentous rhythm of sea
barbarous smell of wet earth ransackingor ravaged flowers the landfill
site shit-hole killing ground from which we supas shaking hiccuping drunks 
To forfeit wisdom atone for sins undonethe allegorical
hand thrust into torture noise shadowsof men  Between the lines
against the clock this does not makedoes not make a difference to them 
This age our age demands an image of itsaccelerated grimace   
an old bitch gone in the teeth the ultimatecunt   our botched
civilization our grave in the sky last jizzof consciousness 
I could have now blown my fucking brains outbut for a sweet shimmer of reason
blood lone bells in gritty belfries the shallowsof the sea the surprise of days
which slide under sunlight the soulgathered up exhaled as rings of smoke 
Clay is the word and clay is the flesh  Youdrape your body against
my body like a sheet of mirrored glassyou remain comme le ditFlaubert melancholique devant son rêve accompli    The word “red” is not 
Forever in lust forever in heat of fire and flood Mule-bray pig-grunt bawdy
cackle and the stomping of feet to the beatof some undone family portrait
  bad teeth bad eyes beer and paint cans   the name and date split in soft slate 
Money makes an inverse differenceto distance when I lift her back
to me now nothing there but that palecurly head working
a machine up and down an ochreautumn merging into twilight 
I read much of the night  Guns click and spitand split up timber until
the river’s tent is broken old kettles oldbottles a broken can old iron
old bones old rags that raving slutwho kept the till 
Dreams nourished with tears the sweet kinksof fists light rain falling as mist 
The hours after you are gone are a leadwhite morning of  hard new ice
the snow drift of that which is left unspoken Care and great sadness are both a burden 
No gods but a black swastika and no skybut grinding water gasping
wind the wares of carthage girlswith peacock eyes  The churn
of stale words staining the heart againbleached wood massed as bones 
Your body is white as anemone petalsyour skin is stone smooth we
as cold as the dead they loadlike a pile of  baskets mound
of refuse the sweepings of a streetare pressed close together swaying 
Merely the despaired occasion of wordshedmade keener by blessed rage 
Scrape away the prison coating the itchysea drink from this glass
of pure real resplendent blood itsmalediction freshly soiled and snug 
It’s a question of altitude probably walkingalong your eyelid again towards
your tear duct  This dance of firethat touches our lips scorches
our tongues and pulls out the thinbeaten tin of my squally voice 
O technosociety where memory is toleratedbarely as real estate
on which to mount steeples of rust layfresh mowed grass burn gasoline
anything so long as there’s a marginand little but commerce between us 
We never have pure space in front of us ratherslight bondage the world’s halter
this fashion for dressing or setting our hairablaze until we’re ash and ash
in the heat of a blank but infinitely scrollingscreen flared back to scratch 
We begin and end with a groan the tongue’scomfortable wetness sureness
of soul and fluttering lips  Thenlords of unquiet quiet sojourn
each atom which belongs to youbelongs to me 
All abandoned the last rig broken the staggeringshadows of trees fence posts gutted
cars faces blurred and Sienese grave I wish that I could speak only
of  it all the voices of children singing A chapel in spite of  it all
