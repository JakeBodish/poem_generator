the lute’s perpetual tuneWere passion’s toys to lust an ornament      But not such was our thrush-voiced Octoroon The Southland beauty who was wont to hearFaith’s tender secrets whispered in her ear                                                                             19“An honest man’s the noblest work of” No      That threadbare old mistake I’ll not repeat A lovely woman do you not think so       Is God’s best work  That she is man’s helpmeetThe Bible says and I will let it go      And yet she crowns and makes his life complete Who would not shrive himself in her dear faceAnd find his sinless Heaven in her embrace                                                                            20Young Maury loved his slave she was his own      A gift for all he questioned from the skies Not other fortune had he ever known      Like that which sparkled in her wild blue eyes Her seal-brown locks and cheeks like roses blown      Were wealth to him that e’en the gods might prize And when her slender waist to him he drewThe sum of every earthly bliss he knew                                                                             21They had grown up together he and she       A world unto themselves  All else was bare A desert to them and an unknown sea       Their lives were like the birds’ lives free and fairAnd flowed together like a melody       They could not live apart Ah silly pairBut since she was his slave what need to sayA swarm of troubles soon beset their way                                                                            22Just in the dawn of blushing womanhood      Her swan-neck glimpsed through shocks of wavy hairA hint of olives in her gentle blood      Suggesting passion in a rosy lairThis shapely Venus of the cabins stood      In all but birth a princess tall and fairAnd is it any wonder that this braveAnd proud young master came to love his slave                                    28If it be shame to love a pretty woman      Then shameful loving is a pretty thing And of all things the most divinely human      Is this Love purifies life’s Fountain SpringAnd he who has not quaffed that fount is no man       I’d rather be a lover than a king And then preach as we will or may we’ll findThat Cupid dear young god is sometimes blind                                     55Before the world I hold that none of these      The Shushan slave the Oreb shepherdessNor Moab’s gleaner ever had the ease      Of carriage grace of speech the statelinessOf step and pose nor had the art to please      And charm with symphonies of form and dressNor had such wond’rous eyes such lovely mouthAs had this blue-eyed daughter Lena of the South                                    56Had priest or prophet ever heard her singing      Or seen her where the clover was in bloomWading knee-deep while larks were upward springing      And winds could scarcely breathe for want of room Thus seen her from the dappled hillsides bringing      The cows home in the sunset’s golden gloomOur good old Bible would have had much moreOf love and romance mixed with sacred lore                                     57What man is there who would not dare defend      A life like this Is doing so a sinOr who should blush to be known as her friend      White wonder of creation fashioned inThe moulds of loveliness kings might contend      On martial fields a prize like her to winAnd yet the cabin’s hate and mansion’s scorn She suffered both betwixt them being born                                     59When genial Spring first hears the mating thrush       Where waters gossip and the wild flowers throngLove rears her altar in the leafy bush      And Nature chants the sweetest bridal-song When love is free with madness in its rush      Its very strength defends the heart from wrong Love when untutored walks a harmless wayWith feet though bare that never go astray                                     153Mind knows no death  Life is the “first and last ”      The falling leaf leaves its source living stillThe flower which withers in the autumn blast      Dies not but thus escapes the winter’s chillAnd will return through changes strange and vast      When summoned forth to range o’er vale and hill Shall mind which thus perceives Life’s changes dieHath only matter immortality                                    156But “if a man die shall he live again”      This baffling question comes from long ago Shall ashes only of Life’s torch remain      The mind cries out and Nature answers “No”Ye who have heard the prophesying rain       And seen the flowery Resurrection glowYe know of better things than eye hath seenYe know sere Earth is Mother of the green                                     157The wild moose shivers in the north land’s breath      Where Huron’s wave upbraids the fretful shoreThe marsh fowl far to southward wandereth      And calls her tribes to milder climes exploreAll Nature seems to sigh “Remember death      For all the living soon shall be no more ”But mark how Faith sweeps on with tireless wingTo find for e’en the fowl an endless spring                                     159Let scoffers mock let unbelief deny       Agnosticism stolidly ignoreLet worldly wisdom proudly ask us “Why”      And still the soul cries out for something more For something better than philosophy       Still longs for higher joys and looks beforeAnd cannot rest will ne’er contented beTill triumph over matter leaves mind free                                     160Then hail we all the spirits of the just      With Lena we shall join them all  The mindNow risen looks down on Life’s unmeaning dust      And soars to higher spheres all unconfinedTo spheres of love and duty hope and trust      And leaves the sordid and corrupt behind The Virgin is the sign of vanquished nightHer child is born born of the soul the Light                                     161Farewell In grandeur sinks the closing day      And on our vision slowly fades the lightAnd bygone scenes like shadows fall away      To settle in the blank of coming night The Octoroon has passed but not for aye      To those who have the gift of inner sightThe spirit of all nature prophesiesA home for love and beauty in the skies
