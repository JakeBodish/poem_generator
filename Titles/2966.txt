
I stopped at a red light on Mass  Ave 
in Boston a couple blocks away
from the bridge and a woman in a beat-up
old Buick backed into me  Like cranked her wheel
rammed right into my side  I drove a Chevy
pickup truck  It being Boston I got out
of the car yelling swearing at this woman
a little woman whose first language was not English 
But she lived and drove in Boston too so she knew
we both knew that the thing to do
is get out of the car slam the door
as hard as you fucking can and yell things like What the fuckwere you thinking You fucking blind What the fuckis going on Jesus Christ So we swore
at each other with perfect posture unnaturally angled
chins  I threw my arms around sudden
jerking motions with my whole arms the backs
of my hands toward where she had hit my truck 
But she hadnt hit my truck  She hit
the tire no damage done  Her car
was fine too  We saw this while
we were yelling and then we were stuck 
The next line in our little drama should have beenLook at this fucking dent Im not paying for thisshit  Im calling the cops lady  Maybe wed throw in aYoure in big trouble sister or I just hope for your saketheres nothing wrong with my fucking suspension that
sort of thing  But there was no fucking dent  There
was nothing else for us to do  So I
stopped yelling and she looked at the tire shed
backed into her little eyebrows pursed
and worried  She was clearly in the wrong I was enormous
and Id been acting as if Id like to hit her  So I saidWell theres nothing wrong with my car nothing wrongwith your car       are you OK She nodded and started
to cry so I put my arms around her and I held her middle
of the street Mass  Ave  Boston a couple blocks from the bridge 
I hugged her and I said We were scared werent we
and she nodded and we laughed
