                            mi garganta my throat 
                            The mouth’s mouth is the deepest 
Rage is the homeless boy fallen down a well 
Shout down and he will echo back 
                                          La lengua tongue 
How long have you been down there
                            Subterráneo underground 
The letters of Cortés are difficult to read
                            on each page a horse dies 
The lord of the city lives homeless in a canoe 
Hundreds of natives are speared 
              Another town is burned alive
              with all its caged creatures 
On each page the people appear to walk
                                                        over their dead La tierra estercolada the earth fertilized
spreads a cloth whose pattern repeats 
                            On each page the future arrives
on a raft woven of snakes 
              Over and over the design obliterates 
Never does he say this was their home we took
