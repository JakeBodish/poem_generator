
My dog has died 
I buried him in the garden
next to a rusted old machine 
Some day Ill join him right there
but now hes gone with his shaggy coat
his bad manners and his cold nose
and I the materialist who never believed
in any promised heaven in the sky
for any human being
I believe in a heaven Ill never enter 
Yes I believe in a heaven for all dogdom
where my dog waits for my arrival
waving his fan-like tail in friendship 
Ai Ill not speak of sadness here on earth
of having lost a companion
who was never servile 
His friendship for me like that of a porcupine
withholding its authority
was the friendship of a star aloof
with no more intimacy than was called for
with no exaggerations
he never climbed all over my clothes
filling me full of his hair or his mange
he never rubbed up against my knee
like other dogs obsessed with sex 
No my dog used to gaze at me
paying me the attention I need
the attention required
to make a vain person like me understand
that being a dog he was wasting time
but with those eyes so much purer than mine
hed keep on gazing at me
with a look that reserved for me alone
all his sweet and shaggy life
always near me never troubling me
and asking nothing 
Ai how many times have I envied his tail
as we walked together on the shores of the sea
in the lonely winter of Isla Negra
where the wintering birds filled the sky
and my hairy dog was jumping about
full of the voltage of the seas movement
my wandering dog sniffing away
with his golden tail held high
face to face with the oceans spray 
Joyful joyful joyful
as only dogs know how to be happy
with only the autonomy
of their shameless spirit 
There are no good-byes for my dog who has died
and we dont now and never did lie to each other 
So now hes gone and I buried him
and thats all there is to it
