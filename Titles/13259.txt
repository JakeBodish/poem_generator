
As a kid sitting in a yellow vinyl
booth in the back of Earl’s Tavern
you watch the late-afternoon drunks
coming and going sunlight breaking
through the smoky dark as the door
opens and closes and it’s the future
flashing ahead like the taillights
of a semi as you drop over a rise
in the road on your way to Amarillobright lights and blonde-haired women
as Billy used to say slumped over
his beer like a snail make a real man
out of you
