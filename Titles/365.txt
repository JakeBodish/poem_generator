
I’ll conjure the perfect Easter
 we’ll plant mini spruces in the yard 
my pink gloves  your green gloves
 
like parrots from an opera over the earth 
We’ll chatter about our enemies’ spectacular deaths 
I’ll conjure the perfect Easter
 
dark pesto sauce sealed with lemon
long cords of fusilli to remind you of my hair
 my pink gloves  Your gloves are green
 
 transparent like the skin of Christ
when He returned filmed over with moss roses 
I’ll conjure as perfect an Easter
 
provolone cut from the whole ball
woody herbs burning our tongues it’s a holiday
I conjure with my pink-and-green gloves
 
wrangling life from the dirt  It all turns out
as I’d hoped  The warlocks of winter are dead
 it’s Easter  I dig up body after body after body
with my pink gloves my green gloves
