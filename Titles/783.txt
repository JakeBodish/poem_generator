
The commentators rabbiting on and on
about how its so easy for Roger resentment
thick as butter still in a box  Yet word
from those whove done their homework
is how the man loves to train how much
he relishes putting in the hours
just as magicians shuffle card after card
countless to mere humans
but carefully all accounted for 
At hearing luck again I stop
until my hands relax their clutch
on the cone from which a dozen more
peonies are to materialize  I make it look easy
to grow a garden on top of a sheet
of fondant and thats how it should appear
as natural and as meant-to-be
as the spin of a ball from the sweetest spot
of a racquet whisked through the air like a wand
