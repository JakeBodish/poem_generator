
I see my mother at thirteen
in a village so small
it’s never given a name 
 
Monsoon season drying up 
steam lifting in full-bodied waves 
She chops bắp chuối for the hogs 
 
Her hair dips to the small of her back
as if smeared in black
and polished to a shine 
 
She wears a deep side-part
that splits her hair
into two uneven planes 
 
They come to watch her
Americans Marines just boys
eighteen or nineteen 
 
With scissor-fingers
they snip the air
point at their helmets
 
and then at her hair 
All they want is a small lock 
something for a bit of good luck 
 
Days later my mother
is sent to the city
for safekeeping 
 
She will return home once
only to be given away
to my father 
 
In the pictures
the cake is sweet
and round 
 
My mother’s hair
which spans the length
of her áo dài
 
is long washed and uncut
