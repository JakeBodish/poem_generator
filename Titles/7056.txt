
I 1        Ruin seize thee ruthless KingConfusion on thy banners waitTho fannd by Conquests crimson wingThey mock the air with idle state Helm nor hauberks twisted mailNor even thy virtues tyrant shall availTo save thy secret soul from nightly fearsFrom Cambrias curse from Cambrias tears
     Such were the sounds that oer the crested prideOf the first Edward scatterd wild dismayAs down the steep of Snowdons shaggy sideHe wound with toilsome march his long array Stout Gloster stood aghast in speechless tranceTo arms cried Mortimer and couchd his quivring lance I 2        On a rock whose haughty browFrowns oer old Conways foaming floodRobd in the sable garb of woeWith haggard eyes the poet stoodLoose his beard and hoary hairStreamd like a meteor to the troubled airAnd with a masters hand and prophets fireStruck the deep sorrows of his lyre
   Hark how each giant-oak and desert caveSighs to the torrents awful voice beneathOer thee O King their hundred arms they waveRevenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breatheVocal no more since Cambrias fatal dayTo high-born Hoels harp or soft Llewellyns lay I 3        Cold is Cadwallos tongueThat hushd the stormy mainBrave Urien sleeps upon his craggy bedMountains ye mourn in vainModred whose magic songMade huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud-toppd head On dreary Arvons shore they lieSmeard with gore and ghastly paleFar far aloof th affrighted ravens sailThe famishd eagle screams and passes by 
   Dear lost companions of my tuneful artDear as the light that visits these sad eyesDear as the ruddy drops that warm my heartYe died amidst your dying countrys cries 
   No more I weep  They do not sleep On yonder cliffs a griesly bandI see them sit they linger yetAvengers of their native landWith me in dreadful harmony they joinAnd weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line II 1        Weave the warp and weave the woofThe winding sheet of Edwards race Give ample room and verge enoughThe characters of hell to trace Mark the year and mark the nightWhen Severn shall re-echo with affrightThe shrieks of death thro Berkleys roofs that ringShrieks of an agonising KingShe-Wolf of France with unrelenting fangsThat tearst the bowels of thy mangled mateFrom thee be born who oer thy country hangsThe scourge of Heavn  What terrors round him waitAmazement in his van with Flight combindAnd Sorrows faded form and Solitude behind II 2        Mighty victor mighty lordLow on his funeral couch he liesNo pitying heart no eye affordA tear to grace his obsequies 
   Is the Sable Warrior fledThy son is gone  He rests among the dead The swarm that in thy noon-tide beam were bornGone to salute the rising Morn Fair laughs the Morn and soft the Zephyr blowsWhile proudly riding oer the azure realmIn gallant trim the gilded vessel goesYouth on the prow and Pleasure at the helmRegardless of the sweeping Whirlwinds swayThat hushd in grim repose expects his evening prey II 3        Fill high the sparkling bowlThe rich repast prepareReft of a crown he yet may share the feast Close by the regal chairFell Thirst and Famine scowlA baleful smile upon their baffled guest 
   Heard ye the din of battle brayLance to lance and horse to horseLong years of havoc urge their destind courseAnd thro the kindred squadrons mow their way Ye towers of Julius Londons lasting shameWith many a foul and midnight murther fedRevere his consorts faith his fathers fameAnd spare the meek usurpers holy head Above below the rose of snowTwined with her blushing foe we spreadThe bristled Boar in infant-goreWallows beneath the thorny shade Now brothers bending oer th accursed loomStamp we our vengeance deep and ratify his doom III 1        Edward lo to sudden fateWeave we the woof  The thread is spunHalf of thy heart we consecrate The web is wove  The work is done 
   Stay oh stay nor thus forlornLeave me unblessd unpitied here to mournIn yon bright track that fires the western skiesThey melt they vanish from my eyes 
   But oh what solemn scenes on Snowdons heightDescending slow their glittring skirts unrollVisions of glory spare my aching sightYe unborn Ages crowd not on my soulNo more our long-lost Arthur we bewail All-hail ye genuine kings Britannias issue hailIII 2        Girt with many a baron boldSublime their starry fronts they rearAnd gorgeous dames and statesmen oldIn bearded majesty appear In the midst a form divineHer eye proclaims her of the Briton-lineHer lion-port her awe-commanding faceAttemperd sweet to virgin-grace What strings symphonious tremble in the airWhat strings of vocal transport round her playHear from the grave great Taliessin hearThey breathe a soul to animate thy clay Bright Rapture calls and soaring as she singsWaves in the eye of Heavn her many-colourd wings III 3        The verse adorn againFierce War and faithful LoveAnd Truth severe by fairy Fiction drest In buskind measures movePale Grief and pleasing PainWith Horror tyrant of the throbbing breast A voice as of the cherub-choirGales from blooming Eden bearAnd distant warblings lessen on my earThat lost in long futurity expire 
   Fond impious man thinkst thou yon sanguine cloudRaisd by thy breath has quenchd the orb of dayTo-morrow he repairs the golden floodAnd warms the nations with redoubled ray 
   Enough for me with joy I seeThe different doom our Fates assign Be thine Despair and sceptred CareTo triumph and to die are mine 
   He spoke and headlong from the mountains height
   Deep in the roaring tide he plungd to endless night
