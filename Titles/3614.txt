
Dont ask me
who Im speaking for
who Im talking to
why Im doing what I do in
the light of my existence
You rise you spit you brush you drink you
pee you shit you walk you run you work
you eat you belch you sleep you dream 
thats the way it is
In the morning
tap water tasted fishy
coffee sits in its
decaffeinated cup
caca  incense
have a floating romance
 a stale washcloth
will make you smell
doubly stale
so dont get kissed on the cheek
dont get licked on the neck
at 8 a m 
the trains  buses are
packed with folks farting
their bread  butter farts
the gymnasium
is dominated
by the stench of
hot tennis shoes
 one in the locker room 
a few silly-talking
intellectual-looking
coke-drinking
cloth-dropping
paper-littering
spinach-pooting
smug arrogant women wait to
be waited on
 in another locker room
there are odors of
crotches  jock straps
bengay tiger balm
 burning balls
sweat socks  sweat suits
of body-building
door-slamming
iron-pumping
phlegm-hawking men
all sour  steamy
 wrapped up together
in a swamp of
butt-popping towels
but dont let it
get you down
dont let it
psych you up
Outside the ledges are
loaded with pigeons
clouds are seeded with
homeless people 
lyricism of the afternoon
in a sub-proletarian madman
squatting  vomiting
from his bowels
a brown liquid of death
in front of your house
 its not happening because of you 
those socks dont stink because of me
a bureaucrat is not a jerk because of us
Im not this way because of them
youre not that way because of me
dont ask about influences
You rise you spit you brush you drink you
pee you shit you walk you run you work
you eat you belch you sleep you dream
 thats the way it is
