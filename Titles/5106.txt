
I had a calling I took the call It was all I could do to follow the voice streaming into meLike traffic on the runway where I layDown to gather I had a calling  I heard the geese bleatIn the firmament as they migratedInto the jet’s jets And could I have foreseen that fallingI could have fallen tooRather than being sutured to the bottomlessFreeze-out lake For it is fine to lie within one’s borrowed blanketsLooking up at the Dropped ceiling coming down For at the moment I am employed counting the holesIn the sound absorbing tilesKeeping a running record of the interlocutor’s Chides I feel at one with extinctionBy my own handInner handThough once there were many of my kindFlocking inland or perhapsIt felt that way
