
Stricken seen satellite at the edge of a party
being fifteen with the black bulbs someone’s planted
in the mother’s lamps to give glow-in-the-dark
ambiance to hideous kisses and the ruffles
are all wrong on the saved-for shirt and the curtains
suave in the murk seem to laugh  The liquidy
fin of feeling is destination-less twisting
like paper wrapped ’round a pinkie
in blind date anticipation  Toy for
the psyche phrase to swim through the mind
like an offense at 3 AM 
Half-helix as if waiting for Oh God don’t
say it
