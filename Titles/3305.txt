
I havent written        in a while
because I dont want to talk
                          about anything
Ive been unable to stop
thinking about the knotted thread
             of bad capillaries on my retinae
money or that my morning was ruined
by the unusual tightness
              of jeans around my thighs
                                         like the obligations
of having a body
so ill-fitting oppressively snug
             around an obstinate will 
And while       I dont want
             to be distracted
from this Duchamp thing
Ive been working on      I am
itched out of reverie
                        over and over again
              by this feeling I dont deserve
my raptures anymore 
So Im sorry  I dont want to
             bring you down  Its unfair
to have to hear about needles
and envelopes and flies
                  when you might just have been
enjoying an iced tea outside
             and when I would prefer to tell you
                          really
theres a family of pheasant living
              in the massive cottonwood
we call the Tree of Life 
The males red green gold plumage
                          makes him look
            like a Christmas present
I would want to give you 
So except “I hope youre well”
                                                   thats all
