
Ive always wanted to play the part
of that puckish pubescent Filipino boy
in those John Wayne Pacific-War movies 
Pepe Jose or Juanito would be smiling
bare-chested and eager to please
for most of the steamy jungle scenes 
Id be the one who would cross
the Japanese lines and ask for tanks
air support or more men  Id miraculously
make it back to the town where John Wayne
is holding his position against the enemy
with his Thompson machine-gun  As a reward
hed rub that big white hand on my head
and hed promise to let me clean
his Tommy gun by the end of the night  But
then a Betty Grable look-a-like love
interest would divert him by sobbing
into his shoulder saying how awfully scared
she is about what the Japs would do
to her if she were captured  In one swift
motion John Wayne would sweep her off
her feet to calm her fears inside his private quarters 
Because of my Hollywood ability
to be anywhere Id be under the bed
watching the woman roll down her stockings
as my American hero unbuckles his belt
Id feel the bottom of the bed bounce off my chest
as small-arms fire explodes outside the walls
