
Mother came to visit today  Wehadn’t seen each other in years  Why didn’tyou call I asked  Your windows are filthy she said  I knowI know  It’s from the dust and rain  She stood outside I stood in and we cleaned each one that way staring into each other’s eyes rubbing the white towel over our faces rubbingaway hours years  This is what it was likewhen you were inside me she said  What I askedthough I understood  Afterwards indoors she smelled like snowmelting  Holding hands we stood by the picture windowgazing into the December sun watching the pines in flame
