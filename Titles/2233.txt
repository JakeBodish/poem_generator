
in a different version of this Im the one
sitting up in bed while the nurse says
deep breaths   listens to my lungs through
the cold antenna of her stethoscope   youre the one
sitting in a chair in the corner
with a half hearted smile plastered to your face
in a different version of this
were both in bed   hunched over
while two nurses   sisters actually   listen
to our lungs   your husband and my wife
sit in the corners of the room
both of them completely useless
in a different version of this Im in a chair
in the corner while my sister sits up
in bed   youre the nurse who listens
to my sister breathing   you glance at me for
an instant and return my uncertain smile
in a different version of this I sit up
abruptly in bed   Im breathing deeply   you
put your hand on my back and say
go back to sleep   youre fine   everything is fine
