
In a morning coathands locked behind your backyou walk gravely along the lines in your head These others stand with you squinting the city into place yet cannot see what you see what you would see a vision of these paths laid out like a staror like a bodythe seed vibrating within itself breaking into the opendancing up to stop at the end of the universe I say your vision goes as far as this the egg of the worldwhere everything remains and movesholding what is most against it against itselfmoving as though it knew its end against death In that orderthe smallest life the small event take shape Yes even here at this point Ammas plan consumes youthe prefigured man Nommo the son of God I call you into this timeback to that spotand read these prefigurations into your mindand know it could not be strange to you to stand in the dark and emptiness of a city not your vision alone Now I have searched the textsand forms of cities that burnedthat decayed or gave their children away have been picking at my skinwatching my hand movefeeling the weight and shuttle of my body listening with an ear as large as Gods to catch some familiar tone in my voice  Now I am here in your citytrying to find that spotwhere the vibration starts There must be some mistake Over the earth in an open spaceyou and I step to the timeof another ceremony  These people changedbut still oursshake another myth from that egg Some will tell youthat beginnings are onlypossible herethat only the clamor of these drumscould bring our God to earth A city like a lifemust be made in purity So they call youknowing you are intimate with starsto create this city this body So they call youknowing you must purge the ground “Sir suffer me to recall to your mind that time in which the arms and tyranny of the British crown were exerted with every powerful effort in order to reduce you to a state of servitude look back I entreat you on the variety of dangers to which you were exposed reflect on that time in which every human aid appeared unavailable and in which even hope and fortitude wore the aspect of inability to the conflict and you cannot but be led to a serious and grateful sense of your miraculous and providential preservation you cannot but acknowledge that the present freedom and tranquility which you enjoy you have mercifully received and that it is the peculiar blessing of Heaven ”
