
Everything dies  Without you
I saw one million flamingos
 
ignite a lake in Africa 
The same darkness
 
descended everywhere 
When you dropped your body
 
I hoped you would tremble
for the beak of God 
 
Why did we wash you three times
tearing off the girl’s white dress
 
to swaddle you in an austere shroud
Some say dying not death teaches 
 
You gained nothing
from that reduction 
 
Months in the narrow foxhole of disease–
you dug it we filled it in 
 
My father is thin as you were
in his hospital bed
 
both of you let everything go
care for nothing
 
except that barbed hook–
life 
 
It grabbed you like a thorn
until you begged me “Pull it out ”
