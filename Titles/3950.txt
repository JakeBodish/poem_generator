
I first discovered what was killing these men 
I had three sons who worked with their father in the tunnel
Cecil aged 23 Owen aged 21 Shirley aged 17 
They used to work in a coal mine not steady work
for the mines were not going much of the time 
A power Co  foreman learned that we made home brew
he formed a habit of dropping in evenings to drink
persuading the boys and my husband  
give up their jobs and take this other work 
It would pay them better 
Shirley was my youngest son the boy 
He went into the tunnel      My heart     my mother     my heart     my mother
     My heart     my coming into being
