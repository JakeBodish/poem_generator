Desert heat high clouds and sky
the color of lapis  On this journey
anything seems possible
so we stop by an ancient cottonwood
to kiss  The beauty trembles
doesnt say a word just watches
me so open  Small birds fly by flock
in the shady tree above us  What
settles in her heart What congeals
Hope Despair Far off the river churns
in its sandy banks swallows veer turn
in fiery air  Will these kisses seal
her to me I her lover she my wife
Is all of this a dream my whole life

She is just this side of wonderful
and suddenly the glamorous world
fills itself with shining and we laugh
at highway monuments that explain
how hard the trek had been for Franciscans
in the Indian wilderness poor fellows 
conversion is the devils own
work Then the stones of her dream
turn up under her feet the back
of a huge land turtle  I know
we must be circling Paradise
because the ants enter the fleshy petals
of the roadside flowers with evident
joy and purpose oh my dark pretty one 
 
3
Music my adored  When is there never
music My accordion puffs up
with drinkable melodies  I spill
her tunes into your listening ear
one after the other the squeeze-box
enters the dance of the plaintive gypsy
with its hard rhythms lilts the back-
breaking labor song the worker croons
to earth warbles romantic notes of
dissolving borders  You melt
like a woman beneath her lovers touch 
Music is happy and pitiless when
it sets fire to combustible souls  Even
the raspy bandoneons voice is lyric 
 
4
Sacred  Sacred  Sacred  Sacred  Speak
in a whisper  We slip into this
space half cognizant  The land is very
large indeed bones of the earth
worn down though she is a living thing 
See how she exposes her grace Antelopes
graze on the far plain their high
white tails the red soil throbs
its slow heartbeat and the blue sky
clears so smartly perfectly like
radiance  Are the ancestors near
What can we know We decide
to wander around this prairie mistaken
for Utes buy commodities in little towns 
 
5
Late afternoon we head west along the willow-banked
Malheur after the long curve of the Snake River plain 
Above the falls where the Shoshone went to pray
we soaked our feet in cold water and I observed
the arch of her brown foot  Rabbitbrush and sage
along the highway juniper on far hills and bluffs 
Sundown and dusk falls over the wide basin of land 
In Burns we eat eggs in a cafe take a room
in the Motel 6  In the dark I can see
her black hair black against the pillows  Its clean
scent makes me think of corn  At dawn I hold her
and there are kisses  Then more kisses  Then more 
The day is cold a north wind blew last night  But
the land is open  Rain falls in showers of light 
 
6
Her hand on my thigh my shoulder
in my hair  She leans over to kiss my cheek 
We look at each other smile  For miles
we travel this way nearly silent point
with eyes or chins at the circling hawk the king-
fisher on the snag above the swollen
creek  One night I weep in her arms
as she cries Oh oh oh because I have touched
her scars lightly throat belly breasts 
In that communion of lovers thick sobs
break from me as I think of my love
back home all that I have done
and cannot say  This is the first time
I have left her so completely so alone
