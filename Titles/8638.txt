
In an effort to get people to look
into each other’s eyes more
and also to appease the mutes
the government has decided
to allot each person exactly one hundred   
and sixty-seven words per day 
When the phone rings I put it to my ear   
without saying hello  In the restaurant   
I point at chicken noodle soup 
I am adjusting well to the new way 
Late at night I call my long distance lover   
proudly say I only used fifty-nine today    
I saved the rest for you
