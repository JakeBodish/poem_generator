
Because the butterfly’s yellow wingflickering in black mud
was a wordstranded by its language 
Because no one elsewas coming    I ran
out of reasons So I gathered fistfuls
of  ash dark as inkhammered theminto marrow into
a skull thickenough to keepthe gentle curse
of  dreams  Yes I aimedfor mercy   
but came only closeas building a cage
around the heart  Shuttersover the eyes  YesI gave it hands
despite knowingthat to stretch that clay slabinto five blades of lightI would go
too far  Because I tooneeded a place
to hold me  So I dippedmy fingers back
into the fire pried openthe lower faceuntil the wound widened
into a throatuntil every leaf shook silverwith that god
-awful scream I was done 
 it was human
