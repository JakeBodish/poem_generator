
As this suburban summer wanders toward darkcats watch from their driveways   they are boredand await miracles  The houses show through windowsflashes of knife and fork the blue lightof televisions inconsequential fightsbetween wife and husband in the guest bathroomvoices sound like echoes in these streets
the chattering of awful boys as they plot
behind the juniper and ivy miniature guerillas
that mimic the ancient news of the world
and shout threats piped high across mock fences
to girls riding by in the last pieces of light
