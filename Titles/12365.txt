watching white uniforms whisk over
him in the tube-kept
prison
fear what they will do in experiment
watch my gloved stickshifting gasolined hands
breathe boxcar-information-please infirmary tubes
distrusting white-pink mending paperthin
silkened end hairs distrusting tubes
shrunk in his trunk-skincapped

on his son who will not make his second night
of this wardstrewn intensive airpocket
where his fathers asthmatic
hymns of night-train train done gone
his mother can only know that he has flown
up into essential calm unseen corridor
