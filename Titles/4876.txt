
I saw my mother standing there below meOn the narrow bank just looking out over the riverLooking at something just beyond the taut middle rope Of the braided swirling currentsThen she looked up quite suddenly to the far bankWhere the densely twined limbs of the cypressTwisted violently toward the storm-struck skyThere are some things we know before we knowAlso some things we wish we would not ever knowEven if as children we already knew       soStanding above her on that bridge that shuddered Each time the river ripped at its wooden pilings I knew I could never even fate willing ever Get to her in time
