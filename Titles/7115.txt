
Ever let the Fancy roamPleasure never is at homeAt a touch sweet Pleasure meltethLike to bubbles when rain peltethThen let winged Fancy wanderThrough the thought still spread beyond herOpen wide the minds cage-doorShell dart forth and cloudward soar O sweet Fancy let her looseSummers joys are spoilt by useAnd the enjoying of the SpringFades as does its blossomingAutumns red-lippd fruitage tooBlushing through the mist and dewCloys with tasting What do thenSit thee by the ingle whenThe sear faggot blazes brightSpirit of a winters nightWhen the soundless earth is muffledAnd the caked snow is shuffledFrom the ploughboys heavy shoonWhen the Night doth meet the NoonIn a dark conspiracyTo banish Even from her sky Sit thee there and send abroadWith a mind self-overawdFancy high-commissiond send herShe has vassals to attend herShe will bring in spite of frostBeauties that the earth hath lostShe will bring thee all togetherAll delights of summer weatherAll the buds and bells of MayFrom dewy sward or thorny sprayAll the heaped Autumns wealthWith a still mysterious stealthShe will mix these pleasures upLike three fit wines in a cupAnd thou shalt quaff it thou shalt hearDistant harvest-carols clearRustle of the reaped cornSweet birds antheming the mornAnd in the same moment harkTis the early April larkOr the rooks with busy cawForaging for sticks and straw Thou shalt at one glance beholdThe daisy and the marigoldWhite-plumd lillies and the firstHedge-grown primrose that hath burstShaded hyacinth alwaySapphire queen of the mid-MayAnd every leaf and every flowerPearled with the self-same shower Thou shalt see the field-mouse peepMeagre from its celled sleepAnd the snake all winter-thinCast on sunny bank its skinFreckled nest-eggs thou shalt seeHatching in the hawthorn-treeWhen the hen-birds wing doth restQuiet on her mossy nestThen the hurry and alarmWhen the bee-hive casts its swarmAcorns ripe down-patteringWhile the autumn breezes sing 
    Oh sweet Fancy let her looseEvery thing is spoilt by useWheres the cheek that doth not fadeToo much gazd at Wheres the maidWhose lip mature is ever newWheres the eye however blueDoth not weary Wheres the faceOne would meet in every placeWheres the voice however softOne would hear so very oftAt a touch sweet Pleasure meltethLike to bubbles when rain pelteth Let then winged Fancy findThee a mistress to thy mindDulcet-eyd as Ceres daughterEre the God of Torment taught herHow to frown and how to chideWith a waist and with a sideWhite as Hebes when her zoneSlipt its golden clasp and downFell her kirtle to her feetWhile she held the goblet sweetAnd Jove grew languid  Break the meshOf the Fancys silken leashQuickly break her prison-stringAnd such joys as these shell bring  Let the winged Fancy roamPleasure never is at home
