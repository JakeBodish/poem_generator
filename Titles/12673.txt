
Like a lone Arab old and blindSome caravan had left behindWho sits beside a ruind wellWhere the shy sand-asps bask and swellAnd now he hangs his aged head aslantAnd listens for a human sound in vainAnd now the aid which Heaven alone can grantUpturns his eyeless face from Heaven to gain Even thus in vacant mood one sultry hourResting my eye upon a drooping plantWith brow low-bent within my garden-bowerI sate upon the couch of camomileAnd whether twas a transient sleep perchanceFlitted across the idle brain the whileI watchd the sickly calm with aimless scopeIn my own heart or that indeed a tranceTurnd my eye inward thee O genial HopeLoves elder sister thee did I beholdDrest as a bridesmaid but all pale and coldWith roseless cheek all pale and cold and dim      Lie lifeless at my feetAnd then came Love a sylph in bridal trim      And stood beside my seatShe bent and kissd her sisters lips      As she was wont to do Alas twas but a chilling breathWoke just enough of life in death      To make Hope die anew
