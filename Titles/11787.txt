
In case you sit across from the meteorologist tonight and in case the dim light over the booth in the bar still shines almost planetary on your large smooth winter-softened forehead in case all of the day its woods and play its fire  has stayed on your beard and will stay through the slight drift of mouth the slackening of even your hearts muscle         well  I am filled with snow  Theres nothing to do now but wait
