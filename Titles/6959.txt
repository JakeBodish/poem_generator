
Follow your saint follow with accents sweetHaste you sad notes fall at her flying feet There wrappd in cloud of sorrow pity moveAnd tell the ravisher of my soul I perish for her loveBut if she scorns my never-ceasing painThen burst with sighing in her sight and neer return again 
 All that I sung still to her praise did tendStill she was first still she my songs did endYet she my love and music both doth flyThe music that her echo is and beautys sympathy Then let my notes pursue her scornful flightIt shall suffice that they were breathd and died for her delight
