Outside the room where you have lived a long time
Are other rooms another building just like yours 
Each night a ship sails past wider than the building taller than the highest church 
And though the passengers would like to visit the city
No one in the city ever boards the ship  Would you
Each night this spectacle is seen by you 
The street surveyed
The air inhaled 
Grapes from the west
Cinnamon from the east   
If I’ve employed too liberally the passive voice
Remember it’s the thoughts
The feelings that are of consequence here
Not the one who feels them

Shall we walk to the market
You could walk there blind like Gloucester smelling your way 
Shall we stop for coffee Which café
The one that’s commandeered by women delicate cups
Or the one where men preside baristas in tuxedos the coffee rich enough for rainy days
A window the desk a lamp and a chair   
You’ve liked the room you like to rearrange it for winter
Put things back for spring 
But you’ve been young for a long time
An embarrassingly long time 
Look what you wrote
Remember how much despite
Your ridiculous behavior you’ve been loved

The city never changes it’s never the same 
Sometimes the inhabitants restore a building patch it up
But in a generation they’re dissatisfied they try again
Expose the old parts so you see them
Plainly ruined or not 
Who schooled you
What made you scared of change
Vividly you remember a child’s body likewise you remember a man’s 
You woke up one morning
There you were a stinking adult 
What happened between What will it be like
You’ve seen the images to watch your body spoiling
From the inside out your lungs your arms
The muscles in your face   
Look out the window
Choose a single brick 
Once a long time ago the city was old

Clouds desire the sky the sky the sun  The wave
Desires the land on which it trembles
Repeating the same question day after day   Am I allowed to ask for what I want
And every day the land respondsOf course you’re allowed You’re allowed to be angry to rail
You’re allowed to curse the God who put you here 
I’ve buried many people old people young people 
I’ve buried children while their parents wept beside the grave 
But I’ve also seen miracles 
Remember when they told you
You might die You didn’t you’re alive 
And every month since then each minute every second is a miracle 
What happens next you cannot know 
Is it better or worse to live longer
Really the words better and worse do not obtain
