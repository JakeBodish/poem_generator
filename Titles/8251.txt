
I  The Day Dreamers
All day all over the city every person
Wanders a different city sealed intact
And haunted as the abandoned subway stations   
Under the city  Where is my alley doorway
Stone gable brick escarpment cliffs of crystal    
Where is my terraced street above the harbor   
Café and hidden workshop house of love
Webbed vault tiled blackness  Where is my park the path
Through conifers my iron bench a shiver   
Of ivy and margin birch above the traffic   
A voice  There is a mountain and a wood
Between us
