
There Robert you have killd that fly   
And should you thousand ages try
The life youve taken to supply
You could not do it 
You surely must have been devoid
Of thought and sense to have destroyd
A thing which no way you annoyd  
Youll one day rue it 
Twas but a fly perhaps youll say
Thats born in April dies in May
That does but just learn to display
His wings one minute
And in the next is vanishd quite 
A bird devours it in his flight  
Or come a cold blast in the night
Theres no breath in it 
The bird but seeks his proper food  
And Providence whose power endud
That fly with life when it thinks good
May justly take it 
But you have no excuses fort  
A life by Nature made so short
Less reason is that you for sport
Should shorter make it 
A fly a little thing you rate  
But Robert do not estimate
A creatures pain by small or great
The greatest being
Can have but fibres nerves and flesh
And these the smallest ones possess
Although their frame and structure less
Escape our seeing
