
When I was twelve I wanted a macaw
 but they cost hundreds of dollars  If we win the lottery I asked 

Macaws weren’t known to be great talkers 
but they were affectionate 
 Yes my mother said  If we win the lottery   
I was satisfied so long as it wasn’t impossible 
The macaw would be blue
