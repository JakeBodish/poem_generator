
I used to be a dog  What kind Oh a mongrel  Nothing poncy like the black cocker spaniel called Bonzo I had as a child  And certainly not one of those four-footed aloof snakes that go by the name of greyhound  I remember each and every one of the lice that lived on me 
Where did I live In Sicily where the sun shines like a fried egg every day of the year  I had the nose of an angel   I could smell porcini fifty trees away  I knew the man who would start a fight with my master the moment he walked in the bar door  I drank a saucer of red wine every day  I loved eating the butterflies that floated past me   one pounce and they were gone  And they were delicious  Better than the bones of a donkey whose meat provided salami for my master and his family  The boy was very good to me   he used to take me down to the sea and let me splash in the waves then I’d come out onto the sand barking and I’d shake all the seawater onto him wetting his clothes  He loved laughing and I loved barking  Those were the days 
I never saw a kennel  My home was an old blanket under a gnarled vine that had been there since Dante wrote his only sestina in homage to the troubadours  The heat was often scorching  The boy found it funny to put a straw hat on my head one dyed in the colors of the Italian flag  I was up early out scouting for rats to frighten away   I once peed on a hedgehog to see what it would do  I ran along the clifftop barking at the wheeling seagulls and at the fishing boats they flew above  I sometimes ate my master’s leftover spaghetti bolognese in the taverna  My tail would wag like a fan revolving from the ceiling  I was taught party tricks that I’d be asked to do when the grappa was being downed  I’d lie down on the floor and die to great applause  I’d sit up and beg to coos and laughter and I’d be rewarded with a sausage and those were sausages to swim the Adriatic for 
I’d sometimes go down to the harbor to look for an attractive gray bitch I liked the smell of  I’d have to fight off other dogs but I was good at that  I ate one of their ears  Once I followed her onto a boat that was heading out to fill up with fish  I had to swim back and I lay on the sand and slept  When I got home my master whipped me  I ran to my blanket whimpering 
I was once brought to a circus and into the tent of a one-eyed woman with black hair who had a pet parrot  I barked at it and the parrot expertly returned my bark  I lay on the multi-colored mat and observed the strange bird who observed me  I was glad to leave that tent 
I enjoyed hearing the boy play his flute in the evenings  I heard those notes flutter up into the air and I tried to see them but never could  I never stopped trying though 
The one thing I couldn’t eat was cheese  The few times I tried it I vomited  On the first occasion that happened I tried to eat it again  If I got the chance now I’d manage it I’m sure  Who would not like to be a dog in the sun A dog in the sun like I used to be long ago  It was an honor
