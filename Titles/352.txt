
You hold onto life like a hostage  Youre deeply embedded 
Youre an actor slipping into a new script  Youre a comma
Whose purpose is to mark the moment when prose is suspended
Where begins a poems pensive silence or some dark drama 
 
Youre a Charles Dickens character in the opium den
Of a long life  All you want is to sleep through the nights after
Satisfying intercourse but your mimesis may have been
Caught by sexually transmitted diseases  Disaster
 
Is an evening when youre so hungry every apple core
Evokes grocery stores  Being the only one and only
They cant clone or disown you  The only thing you lack is your
Adult teeth beneath the rotten teeth of what makes you lonely 
 
And the truth is that devolution concurs with disposal
Till it emerges when entourage lobbies for Decalogue
And hype is the new preparation before its proposal
Calling for the removal of all shoes shirts and demagogues
 
And the zealous anti-Orientalists who refuse to
Use anyones last names first when denying them service at
The sperm bank where the preferred euphemism is super glue 
Remember the joke about the butcher who couldnt get fat
 
Rejuvenated vaginas and enhanced penises squeak
Thanks to Puritanism gone gaga vis-à-vis bling-bling
À la bada bing  People piled up form a sexual peak 
Two condoms put up their dukes inside a contraceptive ring 
 
Champagne is the new organizer for your political
Campaign to conceive something tantamount to FASD
Of the spirit  Were you surprised or did you wax critical
When you emerged from the driveway to your domesticity
 
Without any disease but your familys questionable
Cultural history Is it such a mystery that your
Mediocritys latently poised to emerge That youre full
Of traditional vulnerability Youll pace the floor
 
Until you face at a number of paces proportional
To the gravity of the insults that have been thrown your way
Yourself dressed like a clown  Your brain will halt to urbanely sprawl
And then catapult your past beyond your future like a clay
 
Pigeon across a clear blue sky toward a lemonade stand
At which the theory of other minds attempts to explain
Why petroleum prices fluctuate with body count and
Meaningful relationships end in kaleidoscopic pain
