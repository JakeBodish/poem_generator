
Then all one day because of ice
they couldnt make it down the hill Or up James says
dabbing at a spill
of coffee crunching toast as if it had a spine 
But he could work at any rate
could concentrate
on that book hes been reading
or meaning to
the flu 
or was it famine of 49
some smoldering fact
hes found in the cold ash of some war 
Gusting upward lobes and nose on fire
his whole face florid
from the heart attack
hes somehow never had
he sways repeatingOh wed get down just fineI expect but wed never make it back
then goes into his room and shuts the door 
Evas hours have nearer ends 
She heats the little disk the cat sleeps on
chips until her hands are gone
the glaze off all the feeders for the birds
then writes two friends
to thank them for the birthday chocolates theyve sent 
The word alone makes her stomach burn 
Which is mostly what age is shes learned
the senses sharpening backwards
keen to what they cant perceive
when to be wise means mostly not to wish
for what you love
for what you love is pain
spices or coffee gin
bringing the evening light into your veins
good chocolates the grandkids ravish
like a horde of crows You stuff your bellies with tomorrows ache
she can almost hear him bellow
nipping and pinching to make them squeal 
Hot water with honey one coddled egg dry saltines
Oh what difference does it make
She picks up the chocolates breaks
the seal

He draws the blinds on a wall of glass
winces at the glare
drags his chair
into the bright crevasse
between his bed and bookshelf
takes a deep breath of air
and buries himself
in one of the early wordy furies
of William Gladstone
never a man for minor keys 
Creak and tick of the burdened limbs 
A creak and tick inside of him
as he crosses his legs and then uncrosses them
shifts his weight to ease
the stiffness in one side
turns a page like a summit he has climbed
and breathes   
Think of it twenty thousand books devoured
in Gladstones life and of his own
enough to keep an army of bibliographers occupied
a whole age and empire crammed into one man
spellbinding crowds until he couldnt stand
felling his million trees
filling six decades worth of diaries
because a life is owed as well as owned time
a gift of which a good man gives account
who would mount
night after night a moral high-rhetorical siege
upon some poor Haymarket tart
in whom ruin
and beauty were one word
then go home and whip himself for a sin
that all the evidence suggests never occurred
but in his heart

And has just one
pleasure spreading through her blood like a single drop
of ink 
She scours the stove and countertop
bleaches coffee stains off the sink
cleans leaf by leaf
the emerald ripple and the paradise palm
both mostly dormant now
reaches high for the philodendron huge since trained to climb
and pauses
remembering the calm
of constant motion that her mother was 
a beauty men said though it hardly seemed
a part of her looking out of her own face
like someone on a train
and remembering too
the child-high hedgerows
alone the lane
behind their house on Paddox Close
the slice of sky above
growing wider as she grew
the little park with its central statue
who was it of
which last time shed seen
weather had worried
to a Swedish ivy sort of green

Emma Clifton Elizabeth Collins P  Lightfoot 
even the names of those women are there
amid the parliamentary proceedings
bulldog scholarship affairs
of state 
He lifts his hand like a weight
to check his watch little trembles traveling through his bones
into the air
as through plucked strings
a sound 
Two hours until the final round
at Palm Springs
with its hairpin fairways lacquered greens
and that great eighteenth in homage
to Bobby Jones 
What a character touring in his teens
retired at twenty-eight
with nothing left to win
at forty storming Normandy with men
half his age 
Even his death was rare 
syringomyelia cane to brace to wheelchair
without a trace of self-pity regret rageWe all have to play the ball as it lies 
How much of a mans revealed in how he dies   
Poor Owen barely sixty Dean of the College
a decent book on Kant behind him
two days of chest pain
slivering into a lifetimes knowledge
and all the old beliefs
come flooding back
silly relics and rituals griefs
youre born into some guilt you cant even name 
Ischemia thats exactly right blood lack

Sweet pickles and white bread
salted ham
a soybean spread
that is his one concession to his heart
two butter cookies plum jam
she clicks
across the polished floor
through motes that rise
and float like molecules of light
pausing outside his door
hearing the Mahler chorus to which he always cries
plays to cry she suspects
as if even sadness could be planned 
She takes the knob in her hand
sees inside its shine
white tablecloths crystal cut fine
as jewels
and and    and a man
with American shoulders and vowels
that face
so open it wasnt like the ocean
and that tidal way he had of filling any space
that wasnt taken
the table where she sat with friends
afternoons and weekends
classrooms boardrooms lecture halls
the very bodies of their children
in whose broad limbs he seems to sprawl 
Was that what she had fallen for
talk of golf and Oxford and roast beef
in that gray decade after the war
that it seemed so safe
a fall

There where the strings go silent
and that womans whole soul
is in her throat   A home can have but one composer 
Wasnt that the quote
That long ironclad letter Mahler wrote
to Alma the most exquisite
woman in Vienna who packed
away that cold contract
her party dresses and her own precocious technique
and settled if you could call it that
into the role
of being Gustav Mahlers wifeI am not happy and yet not unhappy My ship is in the harbor but it has sprung a leak 
But he loved her and she is in his music
as surely as the God
he never quite possessed nor fully lost
as surely as the daughter is alive
inside this song whose life
it cost 
Gladstone also had a daughter die at five 
Odd
not to have thought of that before 
And Mahlers sisters name was Anna
and Gladstones sister Ann
and wasnt Mrs  Gladstones family from Oxford or nearOh William dear
she told him once if you werent such a great man youd be a terrible bore 
 
• 
Was that a laugh or a sob
Mahler dies off
into the long silences polite applause
and weirdly reverential tones of golf 
This could take all day 
She lets go of the knob
backs away

He looks up as if hes heard a sound 
what was it called
that late-medieval game out of which golf evolved
He looks down
OConnors on the second tee
It must have started earlier than he thoughtSteady head steady head
that pro at Sea Pines always said 
James lifts one hand above his knee
so palsied now
he cant keep his cocktails quiet
as if every instant were a shock
his body took Think of a stake
driven through your skull into the ground
