 “Deseo de persistencia” Poesía Náhuatl



1
In the region of rain and cloud
I live in shade
under the moss mat of days bruised
                        purple with desire 
My dominion is a song in the wide ring of water 
There I run to and fro
braiding the logical act
            in the birth of an Ear of Corn
polychromatic story I will now tell
in the weaving powers form in motion
a devotion to the unstressed 
Once I wreathed around a king
became a fishing net a maze
               “a deadly wealth of robe ”
Mothers who have heard me sing take heart
I always prick them into power 
2Y vengo alzando al viento la roja flor de invierno 
I lift the red flower of winter into the wind 
        Poesía Náhuatl
