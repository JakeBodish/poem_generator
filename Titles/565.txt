The face of Chinatown returns its color
plucked from Julys industrial steamer 
 Dry the cup
So we do 
 
Four noodle shops on East Broadway release their belches collectively 
They breed in me a hankering for family life 
 
Here theres no logic to melons and spring onions exchanging hands 
No rhythm to mens briefs clothes-pinned to the fire escape 
 
Retirees beneath the Manhattan Bridge leak hearsay 
 
The woman in Apartment 18 on Bayard washes her feet in pot of boiled
water each evening before bedtime  But every handful of weeks she lapses 
 
I lean into the throat of summer 
 
Perched above these streets with whom I share verbs and adjectives 
 
II 
 
Faces knotted bangs softened with grease 
The East River pulls along a thread of sun 
 
While Sunday slides in  Again in those plain trousers 
 
How the heat is driven off course 
How one can make out the clarified vowels of bridges 
 
Who’s keeping count of what’s given against what’s stolen
 
Theres nothing I cant trace back to my coarse immigrant blood 
 
Uncles tipple wine on the streets of Mott and Bayard 
Night shifts meet day shifts in passing 
 
Sweat seasons the body that labors 
 
And in each noodle shop bowls dusted with salt
