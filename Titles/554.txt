One of the women greeted me 
I love you she said  She didnt
Know me but I believed her
And a terrible new ache
Rolled over in my chest
Like in a room where the drapes
Have been swept back  I love you
I love you as she continued
Down the hall past other strangers
Each feeling pierced suddenly
By pillars of heavy light 
I love you throughout
The performance in every
Handclap every stomp 
I love you in the rusted iron
Chains someone was made
To drag until love let them be
Unclasped and left empty
In the center of the ring 
I love you in the water
Where they pretended to wade
Singing that old blood-deep song
That dragged us to those banks
And cast us in  I love you
The angles of it scraping at
Each throat shouldering past
The swirling dust motes
In those beams of light
That whatever we now knew
We could let ourselves feel knew
To climb  O Woods O Dogs                        
O Tree O Gun O Girl run 
O Miraculous Many Gone 
O Lord O Lord O Lord 
Is this love the trouble you promised
