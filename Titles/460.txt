    but how could one lose the self
 after reading so much literary theory
The shorter i stood under the cork trees
     the taller I remained rather passive
 the brendas were angry at the greed angry
that the trees would die had lost interest
 in the posturing of the privileged
 
   the gaps between cant  wont   
   Stood outside the gate of permissible
       sound  the wind came soughing 
through the doubt debrissoughing comes from swāgh to resound   
echo actually comes from this also 
  we thought of old Hegel across
the sea the Weltgeist  clouds
 
went by like the bones of a Kleenex   
        its too late for countries
but its not too late for trees   
   the wind kept soughing  with its sound sash wind with
        its sound sash    increasing
bold wind with its sound sash
            increasing bold
