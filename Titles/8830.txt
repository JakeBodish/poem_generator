
I laid myself down as a woman
And woke as a child 
Sleep buried me up to my chin
But my brain cut wild 
Sudden summer lay sticky as tar
Under bare white feet 
Stale soot-spotted heapings of winter
Shrank in the street 
Black headlines infolded like napkins
Crashed like grenades
As war beat its way porch by porch
Up New Havens façades 
Europe a brown hive of noises
Hitler inside 
On the sunny shelf by the stairs
My tadpoles died 
Big boys had already decided
Whod lose and whod score
Singing one potato two potato
Three potato four 
Singing sticks and stones
May break my bones
but names hurt more 
Singing step on a crack
Break your mothers back
her platinum-ringed finger 
Singing who got up your mother
When your daddy wasnt there
Singing allee allee in free Youre
Dead youre dead wherever you are
