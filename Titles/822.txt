out of his teens stands on the rooftop
of the embassy in Saigon his birthplace 
He gives his hand to his mother
and all around them a thousand hands reach up
 
not to wave  None of his siblings died 
Their bodies like a fine chain balled tight
in a fist  They made it out alive 
Why is he looking at me like this

This is the idea of a house my father built
in Southern California  These two circle windows
and bamboo on all sides  He brought a jungle here
complete with French doors 
These are the tiles from his mother’s house cool
against my cheek  I talk to him in one tongue
he answers from the morgue

Let’s get on with it 
When I return to that house I eat the food
left out for my dead brother  I don’t waste much 
I slide open and close his closet untangle
the window blinds  The bees are quiet in the
walls now their colonies dying off 
His shoes on my father’s feet are the only moving thing
in sight

On their flight to America
the choice for lunch was rice or pasta but when
the meal cart reached them there was only pasta 
My father smiled at the flight attendant and asked
Why didn’t you reap enough rice

The certificates we use to be certain of each other
ID cards contracts permits deeds
fishing licenses driving licenses car titles carry permits
registrations income statements IOUs testimonials
certificates of birth custody and death letters of consent 
Do I have permission to approach
a drowning man from behind

I dreamed last night my mother says
that you were in danger and your brother was young still
though you were the same
as you are now 
He was looking for me and I was looking for you

I sit at my desk typing and deleting
words 
Twice I dreamed I fucked my brother 
I keep trying to wake up  I keep getting things wrong 
I’m ready to feel better
