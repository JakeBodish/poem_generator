
To all you ladies now at Bath
   And eke ye beaux to youWith aching heart and watry eyes
   I bid my last adieu 
 Farewell ye nymphs who waters sip
   Hot reeking from the pumpsWhile music lends her friendly aid
   To cheer you from the dumps 
 Farewell ye wits who prating stand
   And criticise the fairYourselves the joke of men of sense
   Who hate a coxcombs air 
 Farewell to Deards and all her toys
   Which glitter in her shopDeluding traps to girls and boys
   The warehouse of the fop 
 Lindsays and Hayess both farewell
   Where in the spacious hallWith bounding steps and sprightly air
   Ive led up many a ball 
 Where Somerville of courteous mien
   Was partner in the danceWith swimming Haws and Brownlow blithe
   And Britton pink of France 
 Poor Nash farewell may fortune smile
   Thy drooping soul reviveMy heart is full I can no more 
   John bid the coachman drive
