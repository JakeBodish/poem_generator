
Tird with all these for restful death I cry
As to behold desert a beggar born
And needy nothing trimmd in jollity
And purest faith unhappily forsworn
And gilded honour shamefully misplacd
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
And right perfection wrongfully disgracd
And strength by limping sway disabled
And art made tongue-tied by authority
And folly doctor-like controlling skill
And simple truth miscalld simplicity
And captive good attending captain ill 
Tird with all these from these would I be gone
Save that to die I leave my love alone
