
I am not land or timber
nor are you
ocean or celestial body
but rather we are
the small animals
we have always been 
The land and the sea
know each other
at the threshold
where they meet
as we know something
of one another
having shown
at different times
some bit of flesh
some feeling 
We call the showingknowing instead of practice 
We seem to say
at different timesA feeling comes 
What is the metaphor
for two animals
sharing the same spaceMarriage
We share a practice
you and I
a series of postures 
Here is how I
become a tree
                            
and you
                            
a body in space
