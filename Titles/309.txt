
Because a lie is not a lie if the teller
believes it the way beautiful things
 
reassure us of the world’s wholeness
of our wholeness is not quite a lie 
 
Beautiful things believe their own
narrative the narrative that makes them
 
beautiful  I almost believed it
until the new mother strapped
 
her infant to her chest opened
the eighth-floor window
 
and jumped  My daughter tells me
after her preschool field trip
 
to the Firefighter Museum
about the elephant mask its hose
 
like a trunk and the video of a man
on fire being smothered in blankets 
 
She asks me if she knows anyone
who got dead in a fire anyone who
 got fired  When will I die she asks 
When I was a child I churched
 
my hands I steepled my hands
and all the people were inside
 
each finger a man a woman
a child  When I die will you
 still love me she asks  The mother
cracked on the pavement 
 
how did the baby live Look
he smiles and totters around
 
the apartment eight stories up 
Beautiful things reassure us
 
of the world’s wholeness
each child sliding down the pole
 
into the fire captain’s arms 
But what’s whole doesn’t sell
 
itself as such buy this whole apple
this whole car  Live this whole life 
 
A lie is not a lie if the teller
believes it Next time the man
 
in the video will not ignite 
The baby will open like a parachute
