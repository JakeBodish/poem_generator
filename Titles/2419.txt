
A wound is a blossom
but only to the living 
A May night birdsong
before the first light pierces
chirps out of blackness
My daughters angry at me
and her mother as I
was once angry at mine 
Its a way of crossing over 
Im so tired now 
And my cores
all water flowing
somewhere where the sea
cant find her  And neither
can I  How much longer
till I finally lose her Where
is the first dawn wet blossom
Who recalls how I touched
her mother once Or many others
How night is not always easy 
Nor are daughters  Nor are sons 
And how is it Ive become a father
watching light sift slowly
into the daughterless dark
