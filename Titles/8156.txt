
Every morning the maple leaves 
                               Every morning another chapter where the hero shifts
            from one foot to the other  Every morning the same big
and little words all spelling out desire all spelling out
                                             You will be alone always and then you will die 
So maybe I wanted to give you something more than a catalog
         of non-definitive acts
something other than the desperation 
                   Dear So-and-So I’m sorry I couldn’t come to your party 
Dear So-and-So I’m sorry I came to your party
         and seduced you
and left you bruised and ruined you poor sad thing 
                                                         You want a better story  Who wouldn’t
A forest then  Beautiful trees  And a lady singing 
                  Love on the water love underwater love love and so on 
What a sweet lady  Sing lady sing Of course she wakes the dragon 
            Love always wakes the dragon and suddenly
                                                                                               flames everywhere 
I can tell already you think I’m the dragon
                that would be so like me but I’m not  I’m not the dragon 
I’m not the princess either 
                           Who am I I’m just a writer  I write things down 
I walk through your dreams and invent the future  Sure
               I sink the boat of love but that comes later  And yes I swallow
         glass but that comes later 
                                                            And the part where I push you
flush against the wall and every part of your body rubs against the bricks
            shut up
I’m getting to it 
                                    For a while I thought I was the dragon 
I guess I can tell you that now  And for a while I thought I was
                                                                                                the princess
cotton candy pink sitting there in my room in the tower of the castle
          young and beautiful and in love and waiting for you with
confidence
            but the princess looks into her mirror and only sees the princess
while I’m out here slogging through the mud breathing fire
                                                               and getting stabbed to death 
                                    Okay so I’m the dragon  Big deal 
          You still get to be the hero 
You get magic gloves A fish that talks You get eyes like flashlights
                  What more do you want
I make you pancakes I take you hunting I talk to you as if you’re
            really there 
Are you there sweetheart Do you know me Is this microphone live
                                                       Let me do it right for once
             for the record let me make a thing of cream and stars that becomes
you know the story simply heaven 
                   Inside your head you hear a phone ringing
                                                               and when you open your eyes
only a clearing with deer in it  Hello deer 
                               Inside your head the sound of glass
a car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion 
             Hello darling sorry about that 
                                                       Sorry about the bony elbows sorry we
lived here sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell
                                    and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud 
            Especially that but I should have known 
You see I take the parts that I remember and stitch them back together
            to make a creature that will do what I say
or love me back 
                  I’m not really sure why I do it but in this version you are not
feeding yourself to a bad man
                                                   against a black sky prickled with small lights 
            I take it back 
The wooden halls like caskets  These terms from the lower depths 
                                                I take them back 
Here is the repeated image of the lover destroyed 
                                                                                               Crossed out 
            Clumsy hands in a dark room  Crossed out  There is something
underneath the floorboards 
                   Crossed out  And here is the tabernacle
                                                                                                reconstructed 
Here is the part where everyone was happy all the time and we were all
               forgiven
even though we didn’t deserve it 
                                                                    Inside your head you hear
a phone ringing and when you open your eyes you’re washing up
            in a stranger’s bathroom
standing by the window in a yellow towel only twenty minutes away
                           from the dirtiest thing you know 
All the rooms of the castle except this one says someone and suddenly
                                                                                              darkness
                                                                                     suddenly only darkness 
In the living room in the broken yard
                                  in the back of the car as the lights go by  In the airport
          bathroom’s gurgle and flush bathed in a pharmacy of
unnatural light
             my hands looking weird my face weird my feet too far away 
And then the airplane the window seat over the wing with a view
                                                            of the wing and a little foil bag of peanuts 
I arrived in the city and you met me at the station
          smiling in a way
                    that made me frightened  Down the alley around the arcade
          up the stairs of the building
to the little room with the broken faucets your drawings all your things
                                                I looked out the window and said
                                This doesn’t look that much different from home
            because it didn’t
but then I noticed the black sky and all those lights 
                                           We walked through the house to the elevated train 
            All these buildings all that glass and the shiny beautiful
                                                                                             mechanical wind 
We were inside the train car when I started to cry  You were crying too
            smiling and crying in a way that made me
even more hysterical  You said I could have anything I wanted but I
                                                                                      just couldn’t say it out loud 
Actually you said Love for you
                                 is larger than the usual romantic love  It’s like a religion  It’s
                                                                                                 terrifying  No one
                                                                                 will ever want to sleep with you
