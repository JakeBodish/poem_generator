In this it resembles all the old thinking 
The idea for example that each particular erases
the luminous clarity of a general idea  That the clown-
faced woodpecker probing the dead sculpted trunk
of that black birch is by his presence
some tragic falling off from a first world
of undivided light  Or the other notion that
because there is in this world no one thing
to which the bramble of blackberry corresponds
a word is elegy to what it signifies 
We talked about it late last night and in the voice
of my friend there was a thin wire of grief a tone
almost querulous  After a while I understood that
talking this way everything dissolves justice
