When beasts could speak the learned say They still can do so evry day It seems they had religion then As much as now we find in men  It happend when a plague broke out Which therefore made them more devout The king of brutes to make it plain Of quadrupeds I only mean By proclamation gave command That evry subject in the land Should to the priest confess their sins And thus the pious wolf begins        Good father I must own with shame That often I have been to blame I must confess on Friday last Wretch that I was I broke my fast But I defy the basest tongue To prove I did my neighbour wrong Or ever went to seek my food By rapine theft or thirst of blood         The ass approaching next confessd That in his heart he lovd a jest A wag he was he needs must own And could not let a dunce alone Sometimes his friend he would not spare And might perhaps be too severe But yet the worst that could be said He was a wit both born and bred And if it be a sin or shame Nature alone must bear the blame One fault he hath is sorry fort His ears are half a foot too short Which could he to the standard bring Hed show his face before the King Then for his voice theres none disputes That hes the nightingale of brutes         The swine with contrite heart allowd His shape and beauty made him proud In diet was perhaps too nice But gluttony was neer his vice In evry turn of life content And meekly took what fortune sent Inquire through all the parish round A better neighbour neer was found His vigilance might some displease Tis true he hated sloth like peas         The mimic ape began his chatter How evil tongues his life bespatter Much of the censring world complaind Who said his gravity was feignd Indeed the strictness of his morals Engagd him in a hundred quarrels He saw and he was grievd to seet His zeal was sometimes indiscreet He found his virtues too severe For our corrupted times to bear Yet such a lewd licentious age Might well excuse a Stoics rage         The goat advancd with decent pace And first excusd his youthful face Forgiveness beggd that he appeard Twas natures fault without a beard  Tis true he was not much inclind To fondness for the female kind Not as his enemies object From chance or natural defect Not by his frigid constitution But through a pious resolution For he had made a holy vow Of chastity as monks do now Which he resolvd to keep for ever hence As strictly too as doth his Reverence         Apply the tale and you shall find How just it suits with human kind  Some faults we own but can you guess Why virtues carried to excess Wherewith our vanity endows us Though neither foe nor friend allows us         The lawyer swears you may rely ont He never squeezd a needy client And this he makes his constant rule For which his brethren call him fool His conscience always was so nice He freely gave the poor advice By which he lost he may affirm A hundred fees last Easter term  While others of the learned robe Would break the patience of a Job No pleader at the bar could match His diligence and quick dispatch Neer kept a cause he well may boast Above a term or two at most         The cringing knave who seeks a place Without success thus tells his case Why should he longer mince the matter He faild because he could not flatter He had not learnd to turn his coat Nor for a party give his vote His crime he quickly understood Too zealous for the nations good He found the ministers resent it Yet could not for his heart repent it         The chaplain vows he cannot fawn Though it would raise him to the lawn He passd his hours among his books You find it in his meagre looks He might if he were worldly wise Preferment get and spare his eyes But ownd he had a stubborn spirit That made him trust alone in merit Would rise by merit to promotion Alas a mere chimeric notion         The doctor if you will believe him Confessd a sin and God forgive him Calld up at midnight ran to save A blind old beggar from the grave But see how Satan spreads his snares He quite forgot to say his prayers  He cannot help it for his heart Sometimes to act the parsons part Quotes from the Bible many a sentence That moves his patients to repentance And when his medcines do no good Supports their minds with heavnly food At which however well intended He hears the clergy are offended And grown so bold behind his back To call him hypocrite and quack  In his own church he keeps a seat Says grace before and after meat And calls without affecting airs His household twice a day to prayers  He shuns apothecaries shops And hates to cram the sick with slops He scorns to make his art a trade Nor bribes my ladys favrite maid  Old nurse-keepers would never hire To recommend him to the squire Which others whom he will not name Have often practisd to their shame         The statesman tells you with a sneer His fault is to be too sincere And having no sinister ends Is apt to disoblige his friends  The nations good his masters glory Without regard to Whig or Tory Were all the schemes he had in view Yet he was seconded by few Though some had spread a hundred lies Twas  he defeated the Excise  Twas known though he had borne aspersion That standing troops were his aversion His practice was in evry station To serve the King and please the nation  Though hard to find in evry case The fittest man to fill a place His promises he neer forgot But took memorials on the spot His enemies for want of charity Said he affected popularity Tis true the people understood That all he did was for their good Their kind affections he has tried No love is lost on either side  He came to Court with fortune clear Which now he runs out evry year Must at the rate that he goes on Inevitably be undone Oh if his Majesty would please To give him but a writ of ease Would grant him licence to retire As it hath long been his desire By fair accounts it would be found Hes poorer by ten thousand pound  He owns and hopes it is no sin He neer was partial to his kin He thought it base for men in stations To crowd the Court with their relations His country was his dearest mother And evry virtuous man his brother Through modesty or awkward shame For which he owns himself to blame He found the wisest man he could Without respect to friends or blood Nor ever acts on private views When he hath liberty to choose         The sharper swore he hated play Except to pass an hour away And well he might for to his cost By want of skill he always lost He heard there was a club of cheats Who had contrivd a thousand feats Could change the stock or cog a die And thus deceive the sharpest eye Nor wonder how his fortune sunk His brothers fleece him when hes drunk         I own the moral not exact Besides the tale is false in fact And so absurd that could I raise up From fields Elysian fabling Aesop I would accuse him to his face For libelling the four-foot race  Creatures of evry kind but ours Well comprehend their natural powrs While we whom reason ought to sway Mistake our talents evry day  The ass was never known so stupid To act the part of Tray or Cupid Nor leaps upon his masters lap There to be strokd and fed with pap As Aesop would the world persuade He better understands his trade Nor comes wheneer his lady whistles But carries loads and feeds on thistles  Our authors meaning I presume is A creature bipes et implumis Wherein the moralist designd A compliment on human kind For here he owns that now and then Beasts may degenerate into men
