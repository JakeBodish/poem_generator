
Who is the barber
with the straight razor
at the neck of the Mad King
the physician of the Don
who must hold his broken feet
and cloudy wisps of hair
from between his legs
while he knows nothing
The possibilities
are numerous what jobs
we get ourselves into 
I feel like at this moment
I could be anyone in the world
because I could be
a hundred objects
of torture whatever
the mind can come up with
has been done
