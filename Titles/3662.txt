
The sail is so vast when its laid out on the driveway 
I stake it with a screwdriver through the shackle
at the tack to stretch it smooth
pulling on the head and clew  Now its smooth
as a nights worth of new snow 
My wife my partner has been torn from her busy day 
We face each other across the sails foot
and with my right hand and her left hand
Im right handed shes left handed
we pull an arms length of the sail
down over itself then do this again
keeping my left hand and her right hand towards the foot 
Each fold is easier since the sail grows narrower
near the top  Then we fold towards each other
and I wrap my arms around it while she holds the bags mouth open
the gray bag that will cover it through the winter 
Then I thank her  And the driveway is visible again
as it is in spring when all the snow has melted
