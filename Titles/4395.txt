
Once we were coming back
From a  fête votive in Goudargues
When sticky with pink barbe à papa
And queasy because
The hairpinning road through St Marcel de Careiret
Resembled the crazy-maze passage of our caroming bumper car
We were met by a stream of sangliers   
Wild boars   
Dashing across the D9 near the Forêt de Cavillargues 
They pelted in a single ribbon as I recall
So how could we even tell what they were
How distinguish that ruche of  shadow and wind
From any other ghost of  the district
That year I came across
A theory about the suffix –argues
That trails behind village names all around here 
Vallérargues St André d’Olérargues Goussargues Foussargues 
It may refer to an area of  land
Given to Roman soldiers after service in North Africa
By the praetor in Nîmes 
Cavillargues  The acres of Cavillus perhaps 
The hairy pigs had emigrated perhaps from the Caucasus
And no doubt had settled the Val de Tave long before Cavillus
Arrived to begin gentrification 
He wandered from the marble steps of the Maison Carrée
Perhaps having paid obeisance to Roman gods and governors
Perhaps uncertain from an encounter with the local plonk
And les sangliers came out to give him a thrill
And to tell himthat this is not yet the Forêt de Cavillarguesyou can’t run through it as if you were a ground-level mistralwith your feet like bound clumps of asparagusand your eyes on the Perseid meteor showersall roads lead to Rome except ours
