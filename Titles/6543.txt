
As the stores close a winter light
    opens air to iris blue
    glint of frost through the smoke
    grains of mica salt of the sidewalk 
As the buildings close released autonomous   
    feet pattern the streets
    in hurry and stroll balloon heads
    drift and dive above them the bodies   
    arent really there 
As the lights brighten as the sky darkens
    a woman with crooked heels says to another woman   
    while they step along at a fair pace
    You know Im telling you what I love best   
    is life  I love life Even if I ever get
    to be old and wheezy or limp You know   
    Limping along Id still
