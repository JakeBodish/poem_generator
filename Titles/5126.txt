
I get there early and I find a chair I squeeze my plastic cup of wine  I nod I maladroitly eat a pretzel rodand second an opinion I don’t share I think whatever else I am I’m there Afterwards I escape across the quadinto fresh air alone again thank god Nobody cares  They’re quite right not to care I can’t go home  Even my family is thoroughly contemptuous of me I look bad  I’m exactly how I look These days I never read but no one doesand anyhow I proved how smart I was Everything I know is from a book
