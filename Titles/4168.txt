It rises in a Champaign County bog
Amid bedstraw and skunk cabbage
Rises out there in an ice age
River valley gorged with glacial till
And swills the moraine-filtered rainwater
With the wafer ash and honeysuckle 
Stalwart set apart and biblical   
As if one of that ancient company
That gave its coniferous canonical body
To the tent that shuttled God
Through the wilderness •
They say that cedar and cypress
Are the protectors of  bones 
You see them from the freeway standing alone
Statuesque and serious
In the dead middle of and vigilant
In beanfields where farmers used to plant
Their families •Who are you like in your greatness
Consider a cedar of Lebanon with fair boughs
And forest shade and of great height
Its top among the clouds
