
Forgive us  We have dragged them into the night in taffeta dresses in stiff collars and ties with the wind damp the sleet raking their cheeksto school lunchrooms fitted with makeshift stages where we will sit under bad fluorescent lighting on folding chairs and they will sing and play We will watch the first grader with little cymbals bending her knees hunched in concentration while neighbors snicker at her ardent face Forgive us  We will hear the seventh-grade boy as his voice finally loses its innocence forever at the unbearable solo momentand know that now for years he will wince at the thought of singing yet will ache to sing in silencesilence even to the generation to comewith its night its sleet its hideous lunchroom chairs
