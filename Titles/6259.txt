and travel with me across continents
but the customs officers are suspicious
they eye my old suitcase and ask me to open it                                                   Pickles they ask sniffing deeply
prodding a packet or two
say Sure ma’am you’ve got no jeera or chilies
now they’ve learned the Hindi word for cumin
so the new trick is to joke with us And one time
                                                  I saw three burly officers question
an elderly couple disheveled
as I was from 20-plus hours
of travel from Kolkata
and as disoriented and yes
as usual all the usual “foreign” suspects
are sent along to “Agriculture” and
they poked around in their overstuffed bags
where some rice fields appeared but
they couldn’t see them of course and
                                                      one officer said Duck Bombay Duck
It’s a fish Dried fish your son
wanted Sorry no fish allowed
or birds
