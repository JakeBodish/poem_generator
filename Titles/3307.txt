
My neighbor is velvety and kicks serious game 
So sweet garlic refuses to hang tight
in his mouth  He pulls women to his wide chest
each time as if hes won the Lotto  He rocks
them gently and gentler  My neighbor
is a master spooner  He knows not of desire but only
the rules of engagement  He says I misshaving Skype on all night so I can listento your breathing  He floats in his museum
of gams drifting from frame to frame
