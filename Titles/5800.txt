world’s favorite
the african story
our group’s as well
i will also tell
them a story but
they will shake
their heads and
my remained mates
leave because
i won’t fit
neither here nor there
i’m like the snails
but not sticky
and even stringy
mostly
herma-and-phrodite
i did not decide yet
hesitating
the rainbow comes
after the rain so
i also come out
i’m like the snail
spine freely chosen
to imprint myself
or someone else but
i’m also hosting
i don’t think i’m stringy
and my trace is discrete
the rainbow comes
after the rain
i also come out
