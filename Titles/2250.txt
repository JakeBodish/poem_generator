
A town so flat a graves a hill
            A dusk the color of beer 
A row of schooldesks shadows fill
            A row of houses near 
A courthouse spreading to its lawn
            A bank clocks lingering heat 
A gleam of storefronts not quite gone
            A courthouse in the street 
A different element almost
            A dry creek brimming black 
A light to lure the darkness close
            A light to keep it back 
A time so still a hearts a sound
            A moon the color of skin 
A pumpjack bowing to the ground
            Again again again
