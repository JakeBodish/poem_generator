
He brings me chocolate from the Pentagon
dark chocolates shaped like tanks and fighter jets
milk chocolate tomahawks a bonbon
like a kirsch grenade mint chocolate bayonets 
He brings me chocolate ships a submarine
descending in a chocolate sea a drone
unmanned and filled with hazelnut praline 
He brings me cocoa powder like chocolate blown
to bits  Or chocolate squares of pepper heat 
Or if perhaps weve fought he brings a box
of truffles home missiles of semisweet
dissolving on the tongue  He brings me Glocks
and chocolate mines a tiny transport plane
a bomb that looks delicious in its cellophane
