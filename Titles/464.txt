
What might all songs lean into
 
               You scramble eggs one moment
and in the next minute
 
               youre eating them
with dry toast and black coffee
 
               in silence 
 
                              On a day like any day
your voice is not your own
 
the grass clippings disrupt
 
a robin too large to fly
from worm to worm 
 
We dont know why we speak
 
               but yet our voices
persist even when void of substance 
                              like a dream youd like
 
     to recall throughout the day
 
but you dont or you cant
and after a week its gone forever 
 
Of course our voices
evolve years before our bodies 
 
our vocal cords vibrate like a heartbeat
               senselessly  No explanation
needed 
 
Eventually all languages converge 
               Each thought falls
 
into all others  And what thought
               resists being built by words
 
                              Perhaps fear placed us
               here in this room together
 
a fear of fire at one point turned
into a fear of God  After that a fear
 
of godlessness a room
where a word before
 
               another word and another
 
word after the first
was all we had all we could
imagine  Somehow
 
an image means
more than the object itself
but not because
 
               its made of words  Most likely
its because the act of creation
 
sets the mind down like a bird
               in a field
 
where the speed of the invasive cannot exist
