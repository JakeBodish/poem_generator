
I believed death was a ﬂat plain spectacular endlessly
Can you distort my voice when I say this
My scared ghost peeling off me
Distortion she says as if she has just made it up
And then she is quoting a line from a poem
Or is it a whole poem I wish I could remember
My voice opens and calls you in
I don’t know if you can hear me
I said I carry inside me the trace of a threat that I cannot discharge
I said I want to ask you things you can’t ask a person who doesn’t exist
She said Why can’t you ask them
If we can’t have everything what is the closest amount to everything we can have
She said Why can’t you have everything
Well you know when you’re looking for a person sometimes they appear
And a light goes on and off in the opposite window twice
Yes you say that was a sign
Strange love for the living strange love for the dead
Listen  I don’t know who you are but you remind me of  
I wish you would put some kind of distortion on my voice I tell her
So people don’t know it’s me
They know what they know she said
I told a story about my shame
It got cold when the air touched it
Then it got hot throbbed wept attracted fragments with which it eventually glittered
Till I couldn’t stop looking at it
Exactly she says
And then she is quoting a line from a poem I don’t know which one
In my dream she reached out to touch me as if to say It’s all right
How I began to believe in something
Are you there
The wind called to the trees
And then it happened
And they said How do you feel
And I said Like a fountainNight falls from my neck like silver arrows
Very gently
