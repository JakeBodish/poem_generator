The sky  And the sky above that  The exchange of ice between mouths  Other peoples
poems
My friend says we never write about anything we can get to the bottom of  For him this
is a place arbored with locust trees  For me its a language for which I havent quite
found the language yet 
The dewy smell of a new-cut pear  Bacon chowder flecked with thyme  Roasted duck
skin ashine with plum jam  Scorpion peppers 
Clothes on a line  A smell of rain battering the rosemary bush  The Book Cliffs  Most
forms of banditry  Weathered barns  Dr  Peebles  The Womans Tonic it says on the
side in old white paint 
The clink of someone putting away dishes in another room 
The mechanical bull at the cowboy bar in West Salt Lake  The girls ride it wearing just
bikinis and cowboy hats  I lean over to my friend and say I would worry about
catching something  And he leans back to say Thats really the thing youd worry
about We knock the bottom of our bottles together 
How they talk in old movies like Now listen here  Just because you can swing a bat
doesnt mean you can play ball  Or Ill be your hot cross if youll be my bun  Well
anyway you know what I mean 
Somewhere between the sayable and the unsayable poetry runs  Antidote to the river
of forgetting 
Like a rosary hung from a certain rearview mirror  Like the infinite rasp of gravel
under the wheel of a departing car  
Gerard Manley Hopkinss last words were Im so happy Im so happy  Oscar Wilde
took one look at the crackling wallpaper in his Paris flat then at his friends gathered
around and said One or the other of us has got to go  Wittgenstein said simply Tell all
my friends Ive had a wonderful life
