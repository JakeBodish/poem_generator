Maybe you sold it to buy junk  Though I like to think not And I dont want to think you used the money for foodor rent or anything obligatory practical 

A pair of boots perhaps  Thigh high burgandy boots
with gold laces  Something crucial as lilies 
Mostly I want to believe you held onto the book
that your fingers brailed those pages inky veins
even in your final weeks  I want to believe
words can be that important in the end 
Who can help the heart which is grand and full
of gestures I had been on my way out 
He was rearranging his bookshelves
when in an approximation of tenderness 
he handed me like the last of the sweet potatoes
at Thanksgiving like a thing he wanted
but was willing to share the rediscovered book 
hed bought it years ago in a used bookstore
in Chicago  Levines poems with your signature inside 
That whole year I spent loving him something splendid
as lemons sour and bright and leading my tongue
toward new language was on the shelf  These
werent your own poems autographed a strangers
souvenir wed spent vain months leafing through
New York stacks for your out-of-print collections but youd cared
about this book or cared enough to claim it your name
looped across the title page as if to say Please This is mine This book is mine  Though you sold it 
Or someone else did when you died 
We make habits out of words  I grew accustomed
to his the way they spooned me into sleep
so many times  Now I am sleepless and alone
another night  What would you give for one more night
alone No booze  No drugs  Just that hunger
and those words  He gave me The Names of the Lost 
Need comes down hard on a body  What else
was sold What else do you know did we lose
