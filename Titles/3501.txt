Closing the door is supposed to open some
inward source as with for example the prayer-
closet the text says go in and “shut thy door ”
Its a stroke of luck when traditional
wisdom so matches the turning of the season

Ive ofen thought of writing a poem of grotesque
length an epic yes and setting the entire argument
the instant after Gautamas enlightenment while
it seemed to him he would pass directly
into Nirvana while the powers of good trembled
thinking man was lost  It was only an
instant because of course the Buddha
reconsidered

Bulls for the bull-fight must this is
absolutely essential be
innocent  The very brightest are certainly
by human standards stupid but
after a few fights the
dullest among them would learn not to
charge an empty cape but turn and
massacre the fancy-pants who dances there
for a bloody crowd  But as Hemingway
noted the bull never survives  I cant myself get
excited about “life and death i e  violent
death” and have never been able to
work up much sympathy for
the brute who runs with his
head down or for the show-off who
has it coming  Ill probably never
develop a taste for battle or
get seven novels written or kill myself

The world and if ever there was a self-evident
proposition here it is the worldis a big fish  Ive caught it in
my net  And now long into the winter
nights wearily I study my net 
The fish stinks

A friend talks passionately in favor of
silence  I listen to him  He says “Silence
dissolves the categories” and “Silence renews
the potential of consciousness ” And it strikes me
that I should say something 
But Ive never been able to argue  And whenever there’s
been a choice between speaking and keeping still
I’ve kept my mouth shut  Well
usually  And only after
a certain amount of prodding I’ve
produced the necessary conventional sounds
feeling the thread of words I spew
inordinately fragile certainly nothing
to depend on  Whereas the craw of
silence is vast and anyway
already has us it’s the scorching sunlight
of a Nilescape or the wind across the Great
Plains burying us  Friend waist deep in dust or
sand maybe we’d contrive a gesture

I passed the peak of my
energy at the age of its
hard to believe 
twelve  Since then
little by little Ive collected
the furniture of my house 
I teach meanwhile and I
study but no one knows
my specialty

A God is born  Some other Gods die  Truth
has neither come nor gone only the Error has changed 
We have now another Eternity
and the world is no better off than it was 
Blind Knowing plows a sterile plain
Lunatic Faith lives a dream of worship 
A new God is nothing but a word 
Seek not  Nor believe  All is occult

Time is molecular so much for
Zeno and each moment brings everything
out of nothing  In the beginning each
beginning the universe is only a
point no dimension and then
it’s a world for a moment and
each moment is apocalypse  Continuous creation it used to be called and now
we say expanding universe because I
forgot to say each moment is more  Whatever else it may
be its always more  No wonder the poet cries
“OhOh”
or on a higher level lyrical verses  But don’t
worry  I’m not violent  We all
live in a residue of
bright pulsations a gob
of time an after-image

How naive can you get I
was wondering when the Great
Year comes around to this point again
and the next me sits signing his
poems Keith Waldrop will he
remember back across the void
of Decembers to where I drift into these
speculations And a moment’s
thought answers my stupid question I
remember nothing

When I think of the books you could
fill with what I don’t know oof  The pressing need’s
for a phenomenology of ignorance  Everything has
horizons and they’re not just
out of sight they loom  Yes and they beckon 
An open door is plain and simple like a
wall  A closed door is an invitation  But if
the knob is turning       
Well I’m closing in or opening up  I’ve been so
bloody finicky the mysteries catch me sometimes
with my lids down  But I’m preparing  I need
many voices for my revenge
