
Little green involute fronds of fern at creekside 
And the sinewy clear water rushing over creekstone
of the palest amber veined with a darker gold
thinnest lines of gold rivering through the amber
like ah now we come to it  We were not put on earth
the old man said he was hacking into the crust
of a sourdough half loaf in his vehement impatient way
with an old horn-handled knife to express ourselves 
I knew he had seen whole cities leveled also
that there had been a time of shame for him outskirts
of a ruined town half Baroque half Greek Revival
pediments of Flora and Hygeia from a brief eighteenth-century
health spa boom lying on the streets in broken chunks
and dogs scavenging among them  His one act of courage
then had been to drop pieces of bread or chocolate
as others did where a fugitive family of Jews
was rumored to be hiding  I never raised my voice
of course none of us did
