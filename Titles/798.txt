
In the next scene Walt Whitman
is walking around Boston
Common  He’s young 
It’s winter  Emerson
is there  They walk
and talk for hours or really
Emerson talks  He scolds
Whitman for slavering
after tree knots and bobbing
with the swimmer  Whitman nods
but in his head he’s busy
tallying his orgasms 
At the carousel
an ancient Puritan is passing
his hat singing “Kill It Babe ”
Dozens of geese have gathered
on the frozen pond
standing on one leg
tucking the other like a dagger
into their feathery centers 
Well Emerson asks the poet
what do you have to say for yourself
And Whitman respectfully
but sure now
all the way down in his bones
where the deep frontier feeling
of disobedience lives says
essentially go fuck yourself 
I’ll go my own way
