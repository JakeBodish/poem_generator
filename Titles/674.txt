The dark one
Proserpine’s master 
 Who contradicts 
 
When she broke forth from below
Flowers came hell-hounds on her heels 
Dis the dark the jealous god the husband
Flower-sumptuous-blooded 
 Go then he said 
And in Sicily on the meadows of Enna
She thought she had left him
But opened around her purple anemones
Caverns
Little hells of color caves of darkness
Hell risen in pursuit of her royal sumptuous
Pit-falls 
 
All at her feet
Hell opening
At her white ankles
Hell rearing its husband-splendid serpent heads
Hell-purple to get at her Why did he let her go
So he could track her down again white victim 
 
Ah mastery
Hell’s husband-blossoms
Out on earth again 
 
Look out Persephone
You Madame Ceres mind yourself the enemy is upon you 
About your feet spontaneous aconite
Hell-glamorous and purple husband-tyranny
Enveloping your late-enfranchised plains

No more stockings to darn for the flower-roots down in hell

To track her down
All the sport of summer and spring and flowers snapping
               at her ankles and catching her by the hair
Poor Persephone and her rights for women
