On the road to Taos in the town of Alcalde the bronze statue
of Juan de Oñate the conquistador kept vigil from his horse 
Late one night a chainsaw sliced off his right foot stuttering
through the ball of his ankle as Oñates spirit scratched
and howled like a dog trapped within the bronze body 
Four centuries ago after his cannon fire burst to burn hundreds
of bodies and blacken the adobe walls of the Acoma Pueblo
Oñate wheeled on his startled horse and spoke the decree
all Acoma males above the age of twenty-five would be punished
by amputation of the right foot  Spanish knives sawed through ankles
Spanish hands tossed feet into piles like fish at the marketplace 
There was prayer and wailing in a language Oñate did not speak 
Now at the airport in El Paso across from Juárez
another bronze statue of Oñate rises on a horse frozen in fury 
The city fathers smash champagne bottles across the horses legs
to christen the statue and Oñates spirit remembers the chainsaw
carving through the ball of his ankle  The Acoma Pueblo still stands 
Thousands of brown feet walk across the border the desert
of Chihuaha the shallow places of the Río Grande the bridges
from Juárez to El Paso  Oñate keeps watch high on horseback
above the Río Grande the law of the conquistador rolled
in his hand helpless as a man with an amputated foot
spirit scratching and howling like a dog within the bronze body
