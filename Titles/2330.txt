is the soul of this flesh 
Eat with your hands slow you will understand
breasts why everyone
adores them Rubens great custard nudes why
we cant help sleeping with
pillows 
The old woman in the park pointedIs it yours
Her gold eye-teeth gleamed 
I bend down taste the fluted
nipples the elbows the pads
of the feet  Nibble earlobes dip
my tongue in the salt fold
of shoulder and throat 
Even now he is changing
as if I were
licking him thin 
            2he squeezes his eyes tight
to hide
and blink hes still here 
Its always a surprise 
Safety-fat
angel-fat
steal it in mouthfuls
store it away
where you save
the face that you touched
for the last time
over and over
your eyes closed
so it wouldnt go away 
            3watch him sleeping  Touch
the pulse where
the bones havent locked
in his damp hair
the navel of dreams 
His eyes open for a moment underwater 
His arms drift in the dark
as your breath
washes over him 
Bite one cheek  Again 
Its your own
life you lean over greedy
going back for more
