Fairfax whose name in arms through Europe rings       Filling each mouth with envy or with praise       And all her jealous monarchs with amaze       And rumours loud that daunt remotest kings Thy firm unshakn virtue ever brings       Victory home though new rebellions raise       Their hydra heads and the false north displays       Her brokn league to imp their serpent wings O yet a nobler task awaits thy hand       For what can war but endless war still breed       Till Truth and Right from Violence be freed And Public Faith cleard from the shameful brand       Of Public Fraud  In vain doth Valour bleed       While Avarice and Rapine share the land
