
How sweet I roamd from field to field          And tasted all the summers pride Till I the prince of love beheld          Who in the sunny beams did glide He shewd me lilies for my hair          And blushing roses for my brow He led me through his gardens fair          Where all his golden pleasures grow  With sweet May dews my wings were wet          And Phoebus fird my vocal rage He caught me in his silken net          And shut me in his golden cage  He loves to sit and hear me sing          Then laughing sports and plays with me Then stretches out my golden wing          And mocks my loss of liberty
