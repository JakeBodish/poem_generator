A headache makes your mouth plunge then it pulls away  The smell of diesel or the smell of rain  Now you are a thick suburb  Under the pressure of a credit card  Your body is a box of mirrors a mercury mine  You have blossomed and spread white mystery of spring  All your blood and treasure is spent  O rose you are sick  The morning rain does not nourish you  Your mouth is caught in a rigid O  Where only deficit is at home  You stand beneath a white hospital almost drunk  You cannot say why your sense is drenched exhaustion or debt  What’s the difference again A braid of eyes  Curtains the color of a dove’s wing  Ceramic lips framed against seismic shatter  “Soft zone ” Meanwhile your uncle is dying in San Francisco and you do not know it  You are standing in front of another hospital whose patients are strangers  You unwind a rope of carbon so that you can post pictures of it on the internet  How much damage does your life do and how can you refuse O rose you are sick  Only injury sustains you
