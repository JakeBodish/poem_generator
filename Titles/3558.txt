
When I tell you I love
the song “Edelweiss”
you have to understand
that even though I too
am a sophisticate
who scorns musicals
I was once a little girl
who stood in my grand-
father’s living room
singing CuckooCuckoo while he sipped
his scotch and laughed
at my preciosity 
And when I sing the lyrics
in your ear Small andbright clean and whiteyou look happy to meet me you have to understand
my grandfather only ever
had one friend a jeweler
who also drank scotch
and left his 10000 Rolex
to my grandfather who
wore it even though
it turned his wrist green
wore it to the funeral
where the daughter sang
in her ethereal voice  Blossomof snow may you bloomand grow bloom and growforever  She couldn’t take
her eyes off the casket 
You have to understand that
my grandfather kept spinning
that heavy gold around
his wrist and when he raised
his voice to join in he cried
to sing it  Edelweiss edelweissbless my homeland forever
