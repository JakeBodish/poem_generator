
When I have baked white cakesAnd grated green almonds to spread upon them When I have picked the green crowns from the strawberriesAnd piled them cone-pointed in a blue and yellow platterWhen I have smoothed the seam of the linen I have been workingWhat thenTo-morrow it will be the sameCakes and strawberriesAnd needles in and out of cloth If the sun is beautiful on bricks and pewterHow much more beautiful is the moonSlanting down the gauffered branches of a plum-treeThe moon Wavering across a bed of tulips The moonStillUpon your face You shine BelovedYou and the moon But which is the reflectionThe clock is striking eleven I think when we have shut and barred the doorThe night will be darkOutside
