
I would figure out all the right answers
first then gently mark a few of them wrong 
If a quiz had ten problems Id cancel
out one  When it had twenty Id bite my tongue
then leave at least two questions blank   
A B was good but an A was too good 
Theyd kick your ass call your big sisterslow then stare over your desk as if youd 
snaked out of a different hole  Knowing
taught me quickly to spell community
more honestly l-o-n-e-l-y 
During Arts and Crafts when Miss Larson allowed
the scissors out Id sneak a pair then cut
my hair to stop me from growing too long
