O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou RomeoDeny thy father and refuse thy name Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my loveAnd I’ll no longer be a Capulet ‘Tis but thy name that is my enemyThou art thyself though not a Montague What’s Montague It is nor hand nor footNor arm nor face nor any other partBelonging to a man  O be some other name What’s in a name That which we call a roseBy any other name would smell as sweetSo Romeo would were he not Romeo call’dRetain that dear perfection which he owesWithout that title  Romeo doff thy nameAnd for that name which is no part of theeTake all myself
