
If it’s true that Johnny Weismuller stole his Tarzan yell
from the Alpine yodel did Hank Williams in the back seat
of his Cadillac dream the ululation of Bedouin women
welcoming the horsemen back from war When I was a boy
only a fool would fake a country sound and my father
made his voice over to ring as simple as Jack Parr’s
Midwest porkless yamless no-cornbread-or-cracklin’ patter 
He didn’t want to be from Butts County Georgia and hated
farm chores and coveralls  Football got him out  The FBI
gave him a way to travel under cover but I have heard him
years later after choir practice and the church social
sit back with a Pall Mall and follow Eight-Finger Fleming’s
banjo frail  He’d hold that smoke deep his ash glowing till
his throat was bathed in tar and then he’d cut loose and scroll
it out a yodel to make Roy Rogers blush  It was no hymn
I’ll tell you  We had a brick split-level in the suburbs
and the radio station of choice adored Perry Como’s croon 
My mother adopted words like boocoo and oodles to mask
her peach-orchard drawl  An uncle might tell a farmer’s
daughter joke the rake fleeing the cocked shotgun
stopping on a hill to yodel “Andyouroldladytoo”
but nobody could say ain’t or you’uns or I’ll get to it
directly
