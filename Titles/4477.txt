
I know better than to leave the housewithout my good dress my good knife
like Excalibur between my stone breasts Mother would have me whipped
would have me kneeling on rice untilI shrilled so loud I rang the church
bells  Didn’t I tell you that elegance is our revengethat there are neither victims nor victors
but the bitch we envy in the end
