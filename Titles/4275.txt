
That was the year we drove
into the commune in Cornwall 
“Jesus Jim” mam said
“back up quick they’re hippies ”
Through the car window
tents row after row flaps open
long-haired men and women
curled around each other like babies
and the babies themselves
wandered naked across the grass 
I reached for the handle ready almost
to open the door drop out and away
from my sister’s aggressive thighs
Daddy’s slapping hands 
Back home in the Dandelion Market
I unlearnt the steps my mother taught
bought a headband an afghan coat
a fringed skirt   leather skin 
Barefoot on common grass I lay down with kin
