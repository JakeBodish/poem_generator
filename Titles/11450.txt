That greasy letter into which my legs entered its tone conspiratorial as his wink a linguistic wriggling of the eyebrows a heh heh it mayas well have appeared before my door chafing the air with the stiff noise of its cheap leather jacket  Am I not chagrined by his propositionto put it all behind us and begin again as friends How do I reply And how shall I contend with the fact Reader that this matter cannot mean much to you and that I as author am requiredto consider how to tell this tale in a manner that will entertain you despite having never met you and having no way of knowing how to affect you get you to let me touch you all over kiss your lipsthen tongue your mouth open move my mouth down your neck to the valley of your chest pluckbuttons off you with my teeth  I have thought of this for a great long time  I have sat here hunched feeling sick I have paced rugs bare  Why should you care His door opened selves spilled out myhearts bucket flopped their silvers across a floor  He was too poor to enter a store too poor to pay postage for a letter so poor hed have stolen crumbs from a mouse so poor hed have sold his cadaver if he could  Yet consider the man his deep voice began to work away at my inhibitions like sandpaper  Before I knew it Id moved right into him wiped the eyes of windows clear mended the tears in his screens made our bed with sheets so icy clean but you do not want me to give too much away What fun would that be Here as with any tale the morals like a molar set far back in the mouth of the story  Open wider let me stick my pliers in wrench it out  Left unattended anythings prone to spoil go bad turn rotten sink into itself stink up the whole house  And how shall I begin to make my account Dig through the junk heap  Start small  He grew over me calmly as a vine climbs a trellis  Your nightgown is unbecoming  A few small terrorisms Eyes wide at my wince incredulous  You thought Idhit you
