
You may hear that your heartbeat is uneven
and let new tension climb around your shoulders
thinking youve found the trick for going mad 
But try to keep a grip on where you are 
Remember all around you is pure city
try to stay alert  On the wide streets
so empty late at night streaking in glass
the color of an alley or the fall
of a sideways flicker from a neon sign
may utterly and briefly disconcert you 
but as you go youll find that noise is worse 
Prepare for noise  But never scream  Even tensing
ears too far in advance can sharpen sirens
and as for horns      When youre back to
your normal rhythm after such encounters
just try to stay alert  Youll never know
exactly who is coming up behind you
but the sudden movement of pedestrians
will finally of course be what disarms you
