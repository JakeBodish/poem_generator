I believe you can get to water 
I do not believe you can get the boat on water How do other people bearwhat you are still afraid of The answeris that when big things happenyou do go through the looking glassbut it is still you who goes throughthe inner text is all still right to leftso you just keep reading Because there is no boat and there is no water I stare at my tiny babys facebut he so wriggles he cant quite be seen He grows steadier more the bluris gone joins us in the myth of the stable Of the quakiness of infancy and old age we shimmer and shimmy into being and out again  In the mean-time were horses in the stable of the myth A quick check of the ocean or any fire is a reminder of how things seem I cant seem to see them You’re on the beach and you find out the secretaryof defense thinks calico cats are agents of the devil Your friend asks if they get 10 percent She was funny your friend The water in this metaphoris unreal because of the way time passes so you cant quite get the boat on water but you can build the boatand a boat is good for a lot of things not just on water Will we without the boat on water always feel that we are missing something basic to the pictureNo  That is what Im trying to say  It is important to let sense quiver even in this stable of the myth of stable even living aboard a boat mired in mud in view of the sea Who wants yet another world Its enough already
