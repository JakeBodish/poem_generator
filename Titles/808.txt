
When people have a lot
they want more
 
When people have nothing
they will happily share it
 

 
Some people say
never getting your way
builds character
By now our character must be
deep and wide as a continent
Africa Australia
giant cascade of stars
spilling over our huge night
 

 
Where did the power go
Did it enjoy its break
Is power exhausted
What is real power
Who really has power
Did the generator break
Do we imagine silence
more powerful because
it might contain everything
Quiet always lives
inside noise 
But does it get much done
 

 
Silence waits
for truth to break it
 

 
Calendars can weep too
They want us to have better days
 

 
Welcome to every minute
Feel lucky you’re still in it
 

 
No bird builds a wall
 

 
Sky purse
     jingling
           change
 

 
Won’t give up
our hopes
            for anything
 

 
Not your fault
You didn’t make the world
 

 
How dare this go on and on
cried the person who believed in praying
God willing     God willing        God willing
There were others who prayed
   to ruins  stumps
 

 
Open palms
     hold more
 

 
Refuse to give
   mistakes
      too much power
 
 

Annoying person
Person who told me to stay home
and do what other girls do
If you disappeared
I still might miss you
 

 
Babies want to help us
They laugh
for no reason
 

 
Pay close attention to
a drop of water
on the kitchen table
 

 
You cannot say one word about religion
and exclude Ahmad
