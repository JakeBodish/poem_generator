
My mother is dying of too much electricity on the brain my father a limp in his walk  my macho lost his green card at a bus station  I want words split letter for letter to turn sound into wisdom on my losses

My macho says Your skin is the color of milk you glow between sheets  ¿Who gives more light me or the luna lunera Too much milk makes you sick   drink drink cascabelera

I want to leave my hembra behind  ¿What are my options She bleeds on the rug births a litter then hides limp bodies in kitchen cabinets

I lied  My father is dying of too much electricity on the brain my macho a limp in his walk  my mother lost her green card at a bus station  Who these losses happened to matter to no one but me  To others my loss is only worth its sum parts

I pour a shot to get the flies drunk  Watch their little legs stagger  I like the flies tipsy like my macho likes me when I am glazed on the kitchen floor begging him not to leave me 
 

•
 

Come kill me over the stove under the running shower head gravel my skin bloody  I am so afraid one night my macho will choke me to death though I am not afraid of dying

My macho says Hembra I imagine the woman I love when I’m with you but you’re not that woman  I ask Who is she My macho says Cállate take off your dress  Each of   his fingers strokes death  I only want to die  So I die una y otra vez
