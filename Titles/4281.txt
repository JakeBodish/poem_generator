
In the desert the moonshivers  Tonight to stay awake I’ll cut my feet
with glass Outside Oaxaca in a clinic my mother said
“I hate your Indian face ”In the dream I’m running  My limbs skeletal
and scabbed After my mother’s death I found in a box
her wedding dress As I lifted the lid a stench corkscrewed
into my nostrilsthe dress had curdled like milk  During the day
I gather tinder Paper  Shed snakeskin  When the last light
above the mountainsknots into stars I crouch under mesquitemake a fire Sometimes the moon stops shivering  Sometimes
I tally what I owe In the dream I’m running through a hallway 
The floor uneven The walls green  Last month as my son blew out
the candleson his cake I noticed for the first time
the hideous shapeof his nose  Tonight I’ll pinch my thighs to stay
awake  My motherin the clinic said “The rain has a fever it
needs plentyof rest it needs to drink plenty of water ” The doctor
scribbled in a filethen asked for more money  If my mother
could see me nowMy feet bloody  My face darker than ever 
Tonight to stay awakeI’ll sit close to the fire  In the dream I stumble
but I never let goof my right breast an urn heavy with my own
ashes an urnI’m lugging God-knows-where
