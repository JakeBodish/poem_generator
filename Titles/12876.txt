robbd of all their bliss Not ancient ladies when refusd a kiss Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die Not Cynthia when her manteaus pinnd awry Eer felt such rage resentment and despair As thou sad virgin for thy ravishd hair         For that sad moment when the Sylphs withdrew And Ariel weeping from Belinda flew Umbriel a dusky melancholy sprite As ever sullied the fair face of light Down to the central earth his proper scene Repaird to search the gloomy cave of Spleen         Swift on his sooty pinions flits the Gnome And in a vapour reachd the dismal dome  No cheerful breeze this sullen region knows The dreaded East is all the wind that blows  Here in a grotto shelterd close from air And screend in shades from days detested glare She sighs for ever on her pensive bed Pain at her side and Megrim at her head         Two handmaids wait the throne alike in place But diffring far in figure and in face  Here stood Ill Nature like an ancient maid Her wrinkled form in black and white arrayd With store of prayrs for mornings nights and noons Her hand is filld her bosom with lampoons         There Affectation with a sickly mien Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen Practisd to lisp and hang the head aside Faints into airs and languishes with pride On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe Wrappd in a gown for sickness and for show  The fair ones feel such maladies as these When each new night-dress gives a new disease         A constant vapour oer the palace flies Strange phantoms rising as the mists arise Dreadful as hermits dreams in haunted shades Or bright as visions of expiring maids  Now glaring fiends and snakes on rolling spires Pale spectres gaping tombs and purple fires Now lakes of liquid gold Elysian scenes And crystal domes and angels in machines         Unnumberd throngs on evry side are seen Of bodies changd to various forms by Spleen  Here living teapots stand one arm held out One bent the handle this and that the spout A pipkin there like Homers tripod walks Here sighs a jar and there a goose pie talks Men prove with child as powrful fancy works And maids turnd bottles call aloud for corks         Safe passd the Gnome through this fantastic band A branch of healing spleenwort in his hand  Then thus addressd the powr Hail wayward Queen Who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen Parent of vapours and of female wit Who give th hysteric or poetic fit On various tempers act by various ways Make some take physic others scribble plays Who cause the proud their visits to delay And send the godly in a pet to pray  A nymph there is that all thy powr disdains And thousands more in equal mirth maintains  But oh if eer thy gnome could spoil a grace Or raise a pimple on a beauteous face Like citron waters matrons cheeks inflame Or change complexions at a losing game If eer with airy horns I planted heads Or rumpled petticoats or tumbled beds Or causd suspicion when no soul was rude Or discomposd the head-dress of a prude Or eer to costive lap-dog gave disease Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease Hear me and touch Belinda with chagrin That single act gives half the world the spleen         The goddess with a discontented air Seems to reject him though she grants his prayr  A wondrous bag with both her hands she binds Like that where once Ulysses held the winds There she collects the force of female lungs Sighs sobs and passions and the war of tongues  A vial next she fills with fainting fears Soft sorrows melting griefs and flowing tears  The Gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away Spreads his black wings and slowly mounts to day         Sunk in Thalestris arms the nymph he found Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound  Full oer their heads the swelling bag he rent And all the Furies issud at the vent  Belinda burns with more than mortal ire And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire  Oh wretched maid she spread her hands and cried While Hamptons echoes Wretched maid replied Was it for this you took such constant care The bodkin comb and essence to prepare For this your locks in paper durance bound For this with tortring irons wreathd around For this with fillets straind your tender head And bravely bore the double loads of lead Gods shall the ravisher display your hair While the fops envy and the ladies stare Honour forbid at whose unrivalld shrine Ease pleasure virtue all our sex resign  Methinks already I your tears survey Already hear the horrid things they say Already see you a degraded toast And all your honour in a whisper lost How shall I then your helpless fame defend Twill then be infamy to seem your friend And shall this prize th inestimable prize Exposd through crystal to the gazing eyes And heightend by the diamonds circling rays On that rapacious hand for ever blaze Sooner shall grass in Hyde Park Circus grow And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow Sooner let earth air sea to chaos fall Men monkeys lap-dogs parrots perish all        She said then raging to Sir Plume repairs And bids her beau demand the precious hairs Sir Plume of amber snuff-box justly vain And the nice conduct of a clouded cane With earnest eyes and round unthinking face He first the snuffbox opend then the case And thus broke out My Lord why what the devil Z  ds damn the lock fore Gad you must be civil Plague ont tis past a jest nay prithee pox Give her the hair he spoke and rappd his box         It grieves me much replied the peer again Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain  But by this lock this sacred lock I swear Which never more shall join its parted hair Which never more its honours shall renew Clippd from the lovely head where late it grew That while my nostrils draw the vital air This hand which won it shall for ever wear  He spoke and speaking in proud triumph spread The long-contended honours of her head         But Umbriel hateful gnome forbears not so He breaks the vial whence the sorrows flow  Then see the nymph in beauteous grief appears Her eyes half-languishing half-drownd in tears On her heavd bosom hung her drooping head Which with a sigh she raisd and thus she said        For ever cursd be this detested day Which snatchd my best my favrite curl away Happy ah ten times happy had I been If Hampton Court these eyes had never seen Yet am not I the first mistaken maid By love of courts to numrous ills betrayd  Oh had I rather unadmird remaind In some lone isle or distant northern land Where the gilt chariot never marks the way Where none learn ombre none eer taste bohea There kept my charms conceald from mortal eye Like roses that in deserts bloom and die  What movd my mind with youthful lords to roam Oh had I stayd and said my prayrs at home Twas this the morning omens seemd to tell Thrice from my trembling hand the patch-box fell The tottring china shook without a wind Nay Poll sat mute and Shock was most unkind A Sylph too warnd me of the threats of fate In mystic visions now believd too late See the poor remnants of these slighted hairs My hands shall rend what evn thy rapine spares These in two sable ringlets taught to break Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck  The sister-lock now sits uncouth alone And in its fellows fate foresees its own Uncurld it hangs the fatal shears demands And tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands  Oh hadst thou cruel been content to seize Hairs less in sight or any hairs but these
