
so it is death is the
condition of infinite form 
the rebellion of particulars
ourselves and each thing
even ideas against that infinitude
is the story of finitude the
dream of the children harvested
in a harvester-machine
there are the real voice
and the voice imagined
and both have a reality
but the latter is out of it
the ladder of thingsnever accept gifts from the gods
 Hesiod’s bitter-sweet sense of it 
rings true and doesn’t
settle the sea-shore down
to where the heart breaks or is bronzed
‘I am happy’ the man said
‘because the toad of the morning
is the worst thing I’ll find today’
and CBC’s TV critic says ‘television
is the Shakespeare of the 20th century’
red lilies fall on the carpet
and Art Tatum drawing his art
out of hymns wanted more dissonance
perfect
there are knives in the air
all around the poorly loved
their lives follow life back
into stone and they dream
a sweeter consonance at the centre
the art of a screaming and
demented oyster
