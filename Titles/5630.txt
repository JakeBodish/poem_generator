She said she sang very close to the miketo change the space  And I changed the spaceby striding down the Boulevard Raspail at dusk in tight jeansuntil an Algerian engineer plucked the pen from my back pocket As if you’re inside my head and you’re hearing the song from in there He came from the desert I camefrom green suburbs  We understoodnothing of one another over glasses of metallic red wine I was playing Girl  He playedMan  Several plots were afoot allmisfiring  One had to do with my skimpy black shirtand light hair his broad shoulders and hungerafter months on an oil rig  Anotherwas untranslatable  Apollinaireburned his fingers on June’s smoldering lyrebut I had lost my pen  The engineerread only construction manuals  His roomwas dim and narrow and nothe story didn’t slide that way though there are many waysto throw oneself away One singer did it by living by a broken walluntil she shredded her voice but still she offered each songshe said like an Appalachian artifact Like trash along the riverbank chafing at the quayplastic bottles a torn shirt fractured dollsthrough which the current chortles an intimate tune
