
If there is a god let it be the hyena
who plunges her mouth into the river after eating
our grandfather’s poisoned bait who
dark with thirst poisons the river
unbeknownst to both of them 
 
Her ghosts stand in the street where we are called
already through “time” out of our houses  She tells
her stories  We tell her ours  We all clean our teeth
with what is sharp  She asks Will you add this story to your stories of history  land  peace
Yes we will add this story  We ask herWill you add these poems to your repertoire of songsabout hunger  thirst  fur  she being wiser than we
says Yes I will sing them ifyou grant me your permissionto turn them into poems abouta mercy
