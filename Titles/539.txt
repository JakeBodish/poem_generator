
My hands hold my father’s older the wires–
picture rolls once then steadies… an English castle
A voice-over drones about Edward I
who to subdue the Welsh built castles 
Some sixty years dozens of engineers the masses
conscripted from the villages 
 
My father moves on to a Zenith
with a bad tuner  TVs interest him not English
with their damp historical programming 
 
                                                                
 
Here there were Indians mound builders 
Here an English fort a few farmers 
And here the industrialist settled his ass
John Ford on the river dredging sand
for making glass  Plate glass 
Why should America buy from Europe
Some half dozen years German engineers and hundreds of Slavic peasants 
 
Grandfather sat on his samovar
warming himself and making excuses
but finally he set off 
Got a room became a shoveler 
Got a wife a company house 
Ford City a valley filling with properties 
 
No one got along–
Not Labor and Capital not Germans and Slavs
not husband and wives for that matter 
 
                                                               
 
Edward’s castles were ruins
by the fifteenth century  Not from Welsh armies
but the rise of the middle class 
The towns around a castle thrived
tailors smithies cobblers coopers 
Drawing in the Welsh peasants 
And what with intermarriage and the rise of capitalism…
a castle grew obsolescent 
 
I turn off the set  My father hunts
cigarettes at the Kwik-Mart on the corner 
Overhead my mother’s footsteps
the tonk of bottles
the scraping of plates 
 
                                                              
 
During Eisenhower’s reign
my grandfather retired and mowed his lawn
until I took over  He primed the filter
set the choke then we took turns pulling
till the sputtering engine caught 
“Somanabitch” he spit
And watched me as I mowed
back and forth for two dollars 
 
Once in the garage he showed me a scythe 
He mowed hay in the old country and the women
would follow raking it in windrows 
 
                                                               
The factories today are mostly closed down
or full of robots or far off in Asia 
Ford City lives through the mail
compensation a thin pension
and of course Social Security 
 
I always drive along the factory windows rolled down
I want my kids in the back seat to see 
Seven or eight probably pensioners congregate
on the corner each man dressed quite alike
Sears jacket cigarette salt-and-pepper hair 
 
“Honk the horn” my oldest begs 
He waves and waves zealously
until a man turns–a man
with my face but full of sweetness now
silence and clarity
