
We are the music makers
    And we are the dreamers of dreams
Wandering by lone sea-breakers
    And sitting by desolate streams  
World-losers and world-forsakers
    On whom the pale moon gleams
Yet we are the movers and shakers
    Of the world for ever it seems 
With wonderful deathless ditties
We build up the worlds great cities
    And out of a fabulous story
    We fashion an empires glory
One man with a dream at pleasure
    Shall go forth and conquer a crown
And three with a new songs measure
    Can trample a kingdom down 
We in the ages lying
    In the buried past of the earth
Built Nineveh with our sighing
    And Babel itself in our mirth
And oerthrew them with prophesying
    To the old of the new worlds worth
For each age is a dream that is dying
    Or one that is coming to birth 
A breath of our inspiration
Is the life of each generation
    A wondrous thing of our dreaming
    Unearthly impossible seeming  
The soldier the king and the peasant
    Are working together in one
Till our dream shall become their present
    And their work in the world be done 
They had no vision amazing
Of the goodly house they are raising
    They had no divine foreshowing
    Of the land to which they are going
But on one mans soul it hath broken
    A light that doth not depart
And his look or a word he hath spoken
    Wrought flame in another mans heart 
And therefore to-day is thrilling
With a past days late fulfilling
    And the multitudes are enlisted
    In the faith that their fathers resisted
And scorning the dream of to-morrow
    Are bringing to pass as they may
In the world for its joy or its sorrow
    The dream that was scorned yesterday 
But we with our dreaming and singing
    Ceaseless and sorrowless we
The glory about us clinging
    Of the glorious futures we see
Our souls with high music ringing
    O men it must ever be
That we dwell in our dreaming and singing
    A little apart from ye 
For we are afar with the dawning
    And the suns that are not yet high
And out of the infinite morning
    Intrepid you hear us cry  
How spite of your human scorning
    Once more Gods future draws nigh
And already goes forth the warning
    That ye of the past must die 
Great hail we cry to the comers
    From the dazzling unknown shore
Bring us hither your sun and your summers
    And renew our world as of yore
You shall teach us your songs new numbers
    And things that we dreamed not before
Yea in spite of a dreamer who slumbers
    And a singer who sings no more
