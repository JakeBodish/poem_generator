
Extravagant sweep
                         of clear sky
                                           darkening
in the big picture window
                                     beside the bed
lights here and there
                               already flashing all
across the city down below us 
                                              Ellen
and the girls out somewhere
                                          you and I alone
you with your eyes closed
                                       I with a drink in hand
you suddenly in character
                                        your voice
a wraith’s voice
                         faint stumbling
                                                   slurry
with morphine
                     and yet
                               still artful
                                                 as ever
even if the art
                      was obvious
the dying brother
                      playing the dying brother Do you think
                  you have a problem
                                             with that
